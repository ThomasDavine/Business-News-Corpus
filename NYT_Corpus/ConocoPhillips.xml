It cited an agency spokesman as saying that 49 Chinese law firms had applied to provide legal assistance. The two spills, involving 3,200 barrels of oil and drilling fluids, occurred in the country’s largest offshore oilfield, called Penglai 19-3, and spread over at least 324 square miles in Bohai Bay. The Penglai field was co-developed by China National Offshore Oil Corporation, commonly known as Cnooc, and ConocoPhillips China operates it. As with a vast spill last year from a PetroChina port facility in the city of Dalian, which lies on the edge of the Bohai Sea, environmental advocates and residents of the affected areas have expressed anger with the government over delays in getting news or accurate reports of the spills. But this time, even more fury is directed at ConocoPhillips. That complicates the response of the Chinese government, because it is in the process of luring American companies to China to drill for oil and gas in shale fields. The Xinhua report said the oil spills had spread to beaches in the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning and were being blamed for a slowdown in local tourism and for economic damage to aquatic farming industries. The report also said “nine new oil spill sources” had been found in the bay as of Aug. 20. John Roper, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, said Thursday in an e-mail message that the company had not received any notice of litigation. “As far as compensation goes, we will listen to any requests and follow Chinese law, but we have not received any notification of claims,” he said. “Cleanup efforts are going very well. We are more than 95 percent finished with the cleanup of mineral oil-based drilling mud, and expect to reach our target of being 100 percent by the end of August.” Mr. Roper said the nine spill seeps that Xinhua cited were not from new leaks but were residual oil and drilling mud from a June 17 spill that were now migrating to the surface. “Divers were only able to see them once the drilling mud was cleared away from the sea floor,” he said. The oil seeps are small, are clustered together and are releasing a total volume of fluids of one to two liters per day “that is being immediately contained and cleaned up.” Mr. Roper added that there was no more oil sheen on the surface of the water. In Hong Kong, the chairman of Cnooc, Wang Yilin, addressed the compensation issue on Wednesday. “If Cnooc is ruled to pay any form of compensation, we will certainly fulfill our commitment and do the right thing,” Mr. Wang said at a briefing for reporters after the company announced its first-half earnings, according to Bloomberg News. “Cnooc is a responsible company and we honor our long-term commitment to the country, people and the environment.” Georg Storaker, president of ConocoPhillips China, said Wednesday at a news conference in Beijing that the spill in Bohai Bay should not be compared with the disastrous BP spill in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. On Thursday, Mr. Storaker’s comments drew derision from some Chinese news organizations and commentators. The English-language edition of Global Times, a populist newspaper, published an unsigned editorial lambasting ConocoPhillips. “ConocoPhillips is like certain Westerners who live in China,” the editorial said. “They can be quite law-abiding back home, but break the law in China. Some global corporations can even outsmart their Chinese counterparts in under-the-table deals, bribing officials and cutting employee benefits. ConocoPhillips is digging not only a hole in Bohai Bay but also a hole in China’s legal system.” United States energy analysts say that China is following a delicate political strategy after internal debate among the Chinese authorities about how to punish the American oil company. The Chinese seem to want to show environmental concern, the analysts say, but they will not push hard enough to scare away foreign investment in energy or to embarrass Cnooc. “China needs all the help it can get to achieve energy efficiency, so they can’t afford to play hardball,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company. “China will push, but not to the breaking point and be like Hugo Chávez. They need the capital, the technology and market know-how.” Michal Meidan, an Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, a consultancy, noted that it took a long time for the Chinese authorities to decide on a legal strategy but that they needed to respond to public opinion, especially bloggers who expressed outrage that ConocoPhillips did not publicly reveal the leak immediately. “There is a need for the Chinese to signal caution and concern about environmental protection, but this is very much for a domestic audience,” she said. She noted that Cnooc, which owns a 51 percent stake in the operation although the American company is the operator, might also be required to pay a fine. “It may only have a symbolic fine or a slap on the wrist officially, but it’s a pretty big deal internally.” Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.BEIJING — The Chinese maritime authority is preparing to sue ConocoPhillips, the American oil company, over two oil spills in June that engulfed large swaths of Bohai Bay in north China, according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/business/murdochs-woes-could-include-bancrofts.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Murdoch’s Woes Could Include Bancrofts<date>Published: July 14, 2011</date><text>Add to Rupert Murdoch’s list of potential headaches a blast from the past: the Bancroft family. The media mogul’s British newspaper scandal has upset some members of the family who gave in to News Corporation’s $5 billion offer to buy Dow Jones in 2007.It’s hard to feel much sympathy for the Bancrofts. But the pact they forged to ensure The Wall Street Journal’s integrity gave a special committee powers that could embarrass Mr. Murdoch beyond what has happened already. As it is, the News Corporation potentially faces bigger legal problems in the United States. Lawmakers called on Wednesday for bribery investigations. And a finding that The News of the World illegally paid Scotland Yard for information could mean fines under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Under some circumstances, these fines can be huge: TKSJ, a multinational energy venture in Nigeria, settled for more than $1.2 billion last year. If recent allegations of voice mail break-ins are proved to be true, American antihacking laws could also spell trouble. The laws can cover servers in foreign countries, so a defense that the break-ins occurred only in Britain would not necessarily work. And worst-case penalties stretch to 20 years in prison. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into phone hacking allegations, too. The special committee at Dow Jones does not have that kind of clout, but could still matter. To date, the committee has been toothless. It expressed mere dismay when Marcus Brauchli was ushered out as The Wall Street Journal managing editor shortly after News Corporation’s takeover. (Mr. Brauchli resigned voluntarily, so the editorial agreement was not explicitly breached.) This time could be different. To the Bancrofts’ credit, the agreement requires News Corporation to preserve the integrity not just of Dow Jones, but of all the company’s “publications and newsgathering services.” Arguably, those principles have been violated at its British outlets. And if the committee of five chooses, it can hire investigators, lawyers and accountants to conduct their own investigation, with full access to News Corporation’s books, records and people. What is not clear from the agreement are the remedies the committee could potentially extract. But it could enlist big-name outside help and make its findings public. That might inflict damage on News Corporation’s reputation that shows up as big dollars as well as red faces. Decoupling in Big Oil ConocoPhillips has broken the mold. The company, which is America’s third-largest energy group after Exxon Mobil and Chevron, is splitting exploration from production and downstream operations. With investors quickly adding as much as $5 billion to Conoco’s value, the message to other integrated companies like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell is getting louder. The current model is an article of faith. For decades, oil companies have claimed it provides a hedge against fluctuating oil prices, offers operational benefits and helps pry open foreign energy reserves. Yet in a one-hour phone presentation Thursday, Conoco’s chief executive, James J. Mulva , renounced one of the guiding principles of his career. He was right to recant his faith. Combining racy exploration operations with more sedate refining and marketing businesses no longer makes sense. Mr. Mulva conceded there were no meaningful operational synergies. And since oil-rich nations can build their own refineries, offering downstream expertise gives Big Oil little leverage in accessing new reserves. Judging from recent history, the initial burst of enthusiasm from Conoco shareholders should be sustainable. Marathon, a smaller rival, built on its early gains after it announced a similar split in January, outperforming Conoco by over 20 percent. It would be no surprise to see Conoco catch up now. As Mr. Mulva pointed out, the breakup will give investors a clearer choice and enable management to focus more clearly. The valuation gulf is pronounced. Integrated firms trade on a multiple of about nine times 2011 earnings. Independent American refinery companies fetch valuations closer to 13 times while exploration and production firms command a punchier multiple of 20. Big players cannot hope to match the growth of smaller explorers. But getting even part of the way to these multiples, according to a sum-of-the-parts analysis by Breakingviews, could ultimately be worth an extra 20 percent — in Conoco’s case, an extra $20 billion of value. Conoco is not the first to split, but is by far the largest to do so. Having a true peer break with the integrated model may finally encourage the likes of Chevron and Exxon to find some religion, too, and unlock similar storehouses of value for their shareholders.

J. Scott Applewhite/Associated PressJames J. Mulva, chief of ConocoPhillips, plans to retire once the transaction is complete. 9:31 p.m. | Updated A decade ago, the oil and gas industry thought that bigger was better. Now, the refrain appears to be the exact opposite. ConocoPhillips on Thursday became the latest energy giant to seek to break itself up, announcing that it will spin off its refining business to shareholders as a separate publicly traded company. The move is meant to help the two companies focus on their individual mandates, freeing ConocoPhillips to invest more in its higher-margin exploration operations. The spinoff, which is expected to be completed by the first half of next year, follows similar moves by companies such as Marathon Oil. Refining and marketing, known in the industry as downstream operations, are seen as slower-growing businesses compared with offshore oil and gas exploration. “We don’t see a lot of value in growing low-margin production,” James J. Mulva, ConocoPhillips’s chairman and chief executive, said in an analyst conference call. “We do think the pure plays are better understood in the marketplace, and it is going to put a lot more focus on our management and our leadership to accomplish their objective.” Once the breakup is complete, Mr. Mulva, who has led ConocoPhillips since the 2002 merger that created it, will retire. Mr. Mulva spearheaded the company’s years-long buying spree, striking 31 deals since the union of Conoco and Phillips Petroleum, according to data from Capital IQ. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release After the split, ConocoPhillips will remain focused on its exploration business, which already produces about 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day and has more than eight billion barrels in reserves. The spun-off refinery operations will have a daily processing capacity of more than two million barrels, and will start life with positive cash flow that will be used for adding to infrastructure. ConocoPhillips plans to maintain its dividend, and expects to eventually raise that shareholder payout. The spun-out refining company is also expected to pay a dividend. The company has not yet outlined what the management teams for the individual businesses will look like. It also has not yet decided what to do with its midstream assets, which include transportation and processing facilities. Shareholders applauded the move, sending shares in ConocoPhillips up 1.63 percent on Thursday to $75.61. Shares in the company have risen more than 45 percent over the past year. Many analysts were more measured, expressing skepticism about how much value would be unlocked by the business separation. Marathon benefited from the spinoff of its refining business because the company was trading at a 25 percent discount to the average of its peers, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. ConocoPhillips already trades at a 15 percent premium. “To us the ‘disintegration’ approach essentially represents a repudiation of the ‘buy and grow’ strategy that management has espoused since its creation nine years ago,” analysts at Société Générale wrote in a note on Thursday, maintaining a hold rating on the stock. Bigger oil companies, like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, are expected to sell off some refining assets instead of making bolder moves like ConocoPhillips and Marathon.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/world/asia/06china.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">China Admits Extent of Spill From Oil Rig<date>Published: July 5, 2011</date><text>BEIJING — Oil that spewed from an offshore drilling rig in northeastern China for two weeks last month has spread over 320 square miles, government officials acknowledged Tuesday, amid public uproar over why it took so long for fishermen, local residents and environmental groups to be informed of the spill.News of the accident emerged in late June on the microblogging site Sina Weibo and was not confirmed by the state-owned operator until last Friday. The government sought to play down the significance of the leak, saying the environmental repercussions were most likely insignificant and blaming the rig’s Western operator. “There is no visible floating oil on the sea and the leak is now under control,” said a spokesman for the State Oceanic Administration, according to a transcript of a news conference posted on its Web site, although another official acknowledged that a small slick could be seen from the two platforms involved in the accident. Officials at the agency said ConocoPhillips China, a subsidiary of the Houston-based energy giant that operates the rigs with a Chinese state-owned company, “should take the blame” for the accident, which occurred in the mouth of the Bohai Sea, a largely enclosed body of water that touches on three provinces and the city of Tianjin. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, an official at the oceanic agency’s Beihai branch, said the minimum fine would be about $30,000, a figure that could rise depending on the extent of the economic and ecological damage. In an emailed statement on Wednesday, ConocoPhillips China said its workers quickly addressed the leaks and that there was no apparent impact on wildlife, fishing or shipping activities.” Upon observing the sheen, ConocoPhillips took prompt action, promptly reporting the incident to Chinese authorities and activating response procedures,” the statement said.  The company owns a 49 percent stake in the venture, Penglai 19-3, which is the country’s largest offshore oil discovery, reportedly producing 150,000 barrels a day. It operates the rig with China’s National Offshore Oil Corporation. In recent days, several Chinese media outlets have reported die-offs among fish farmed in ocean enclosures, but such accounts could not be verified Tuesday. According to the oceanic agency’s Web site, a leak was first detected June 4 and then again on June 17. It said the spills occurred during the drilling process, when water is forced into the earth’s crust. By June 19, the problem was under control, the agency said, and by Monday, 40 cubic meters of oily water had been removed from the sea. Yang Fuqiang, a senior adviser on climate and energy at the Beijing offices of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in the United States, said that even if the environmental damage turned out to be minimal, the long delay in publicizing the accident erodes public trust in the government and its state-run energy companies. “According to the regulations, any oil spill has to be reported to the public,” he said. “People who live in coastal areas have a right to know so they can make preparations.” In a commentary published in the Global Times on Tuesday, Han Xiaoping, a columnist for the Web site China Energy Network, accused the state-run oil company of evasion and the government of playing a role in a cover-up. “We do everything to protect state-owned enterprises, which eventually leads them to think they can always get support from the government when they get into trouble,” he wrote. The case comes nearly a year after a major oil spill near Dalian, not far from the Bohai Sea, that also raised questions about whether the government was giving an honest accounting — and whether there was lasting impact on aquatic life. In that spill, an explosion ruptured a pipeline at an onshore oil storage site run by the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, forcing emergency workers to empty the contents of an enormous oil tank. More than 11,000 barrels of oil flowed into the Yellow Sea, the government said, fouling miles of beaches and a large stretch of ocean. Environmental groups like Greenpeace, however, say the figure was much larger. Shi Da contributed research.BEIJING — Oil that spewed from an offshore drilling rig in northeastern China for two weeks last month has spread over 320 square miles, government officials acknowledged Tuesday, amid public uproar over why it took so long for fishermen, local residents and environmental groups to be informed of the spill.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/25views.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Consider Profits When Assessing I.P.O.’s<date>Published: May 24, 2011</date><text>The big first-day stock market pops by Yandex, the Russian Internet search company, and LinkedIn, the online business network, show how hungry investors are for technology-related growth possibilities. That’s good news for other businesses that hope to go public. But judging them by revenue potential is risky. Profits are what matter.Investors are baking in plenty of potential. But when profit is scarce or nonexistent, the calculus shifts to heady sales multiples. LinkedIn is valued at $9 billion, or 37 times 2010 revenue. And Twitter is valued at $8.5 billion based on private transactions, more than 150 times 2010 revenue. Sometimes an earnings multiple supports such metrics. Yandex is a good example. After the 55 percent gain on its Nasdaq debut on Tuesday, the company is worth nearly $13 billion. That’s 29 times Yandex’s sales last year. At least it has a solid niche, with a two-thirds share of its domestic online search market, and its profit is growing rapidly. At 95 times last year’s earnings, the shares are more expensive than Baidu’s, its Chinese equivalent. That’s rich, but still less frothy than other Internet companies. Some, like Groupon, the social shopping start-up, are also solidly in the black. But vanishingly small barriers to entry mean its profit margins are likely to shrink. Others like LinkedIn will struggle to generate the returns implicitly expected by investors. Its market valuation is more than 500 times last year’s tiny profit. Sales more than doubled in the first quarter, but expenses grew even faster. Across the board, valuations seem to be pinned on every company becoming a Google in its market. But, as became clear when the dot-com boom collapsed about a decade ago, there are relatively few consistent winners. That applies even more to companies benefiting from the snowball effect of an expanding network. Facebook is looking like one of those winners. For several years, it wasn’t possible to value the company based on earnings. It didn’t have any. Now, Facebook has net margins approaching 30 percent, so revenue growth shouldn’t be ignored. But to avoid the pitfalls of the last tech bust, investors should keep profits front of mind. Splitting Oil Majors   Divorce is all the rage for energy investors. The modest lift El Paso got Tuesday from cleaving wildcatting from pipelines may not do justice to market enthusiasm because the move had been expected. But trailblazers like Marathon also have held onto their split gains. Oil majors now have a full body of evidence of what investors want. It was merely a question of when El Paso, valued at about $15.5 billion, would take this step. Since rival Williams divided in February, shareholders have been expecting El Paso’s chief executive, Douglas Foshee, to follow suit. In the two days after the decision by Williams, El Paso shares gained 6 percent. The 6.5 percent increase Tuesday, which added about $1 billion of market value, represents at least the second installment of El Paso’s reward. History suggests the increase won’t be ephemeral either. Other splits have led to share prices stabilizing higher. The one at Williams has hung onto a 10 percent gain. Marathon Oil has done even better since splitting in January, turning a 6 percent rally on Day 1 into a 24 percent upswing. By comparison, still-integrated peer ConocoPhillips has risen just 4 percent. These splits should by now be commanding the attention of bigger oil groups. While few executives want to leave a business smaller than they found it, shareholders have made their views clear. The skills required to run speculative exploration are different from the obsessive operational focus demanded by refining or pipelines. Valuing such ungainly combinations isn’t easy either. Moreover, few investors subscribe any longer to claims by the biggest oil producers that integration delivers technology synergies, helps pry open foreign markets or provides hedging opportunities. For titans such as $400 billion Exxon Mobil, the value released by breaking up could be enormous. Matching the 10 percent gain at Williams, for example, would deliver $40 billion in value. And analysts at Oppenheimer reckon the lift would be closer to the 20 percent gain enjoyed by Marathon. Either way, the affirmation provided by El Paso makes it harder for oil companies to ignore.

Democrats had hoped that directing the savings toward the deficit would make it harder for Republicans to reject it. In the 52-to-48 vote, 3 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in opposing the bill, which was supported by the Obama administration and fiscal watchdog groups that saw the tax help for the oil industry as wasteful. Forty-eight Democrats, two independents and two Republicans backed it. Energy-state Democrats criticized the initiative, saying it was misdirected and would do nothing to ease gasoline prices and could cost American jobs. “Why are we harming an industry — five large oil and gas companies that work internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United States directly?” asked Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. “Why are we doing it?” Republicans, who on Wednesday will push their own plan to open more areas to oil drilling and speed government permits, said the Democratic proposal would contribute to higher prices and increase dependence on foreign oil even though a recent Congressional Research Service report predicted any impact on prices would be negligible. “Clearly, this is not a serious effort to address the price of gas at the pump,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Under the proposal, Democrats would have eliminated five different tax breaks enjoyed by the multinational oil companies, producing an estimated $21 billion over 10 years. More than $12 billion would have come from eliminating a domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the big oil companies, and $6 billion would have been generated by ending their deductions for taxes paid to foreign governments. Critics suggest that the companies have been able to disguise what should be foreign royalty payments as taxes to reduce their tax liability. The bill would also deny the companies the ability to deduct some intangible drilling and development costs. The bill would have applied to BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The White House lent strong support to the effort though the president in the past has recommended applying revenue generated by ending the tax breaks to the development of alternative energy sources. “The administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce federal deficits, the nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies,” the White House said.  Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, portrayed the vote as one that revealed the values of Republicans. “Instead of defending oil companies, Republicans should be defending the American taxpayer,” Mr. Reid said. “We believe this is the kind of wasteful spending that will lead to an agreement on reducing the debt.” While most Republicans have opposed eliminating the tax breaks as a back-door tax increase, some, including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman, have indicated a willingness to consider the idea. Also on Tuesday, Senate Democrats wrote to the Federal Trade Commission seeking an inquiry into whether domestic oil refiners had reduced production to drive down the gasoline supply and drive up prices. “This is just another piece of the puzzle that we need to get at as we try to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and hold Big Oil accountable for whatever may be going on in the supply chain that is hurting the families that I work for,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.WASHINGTON — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a Democratic proposal to strip the five leading oil companies of tax breaks that backers of the measure said were unfairly padding industry profits while consumers were struggling with high gas prices.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/opinion/15sun1.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">A Big Whine From Big Oil<date>Published: May 14, 2011</date><text>With gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $100 a barrel and profits at near-record levels, it is hard to feel sympathy for the oil industry. Yet sympathy is what the C.E.O.’s of the five biggest companies asked for when they appeared Thursday before a Senate hearing on a Democratic proposal to eliminate about $2 billion in tax breaks for the Big Five.Exxon’s Rex Tillerson called the proposal “misinformed and discriminatory.” ConocoPhillips’s James Mulva, in a letter, called the idea “un-American” because it would supposedly cost American jobs, raise consumer prices and discourage investment — a position he reasserted during the hearings. The other three companies at the witness table, BP America, Shell and Chevron, raised similar complaints. How absurd are their claims? Utterly absurd. Take investment. In 2005, with oil nearing $60 a barrel, Mr. Mulva and other top executives told a Senate committee that the companies did not need the tax breaks to keep exploring for oil. Congress left them in place. Now that the Senate seems serious about getting rid of them, he and his colleagues have changed their tune — even though their companies obviously need them even less at $100 a barrel. Or take prices at the pump. In a memorandum to Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that eliminating the tax benefits would have virtually no effect on the price of gasoline. The impact on industry profits — the Big Five earned a robust $35 billion in the first quarter of this year alone — would be trivial. The report also addressed one more industry claim: that ending the tax breaks for the oil companies alone would be discriminatory. Most of the breaks — deductions for well depletion, intangible drilling costs and the like — are unique to the industry. The exception is a deduction for domestic production, designed to encourage all manufacturing companies to invest in this country. But as the research service pointed out, industry is not going to stop drilling on American territory as long as the oil is there and yielding big dollars. These subsidies are clearly unnecessary, and returning $2 billion to the Treasury would be a good thing. But more than anything, one has to wonder why the oil companies are fighting so hard for a comparatively small amount of cash, at least for them. The only explanation we can come up with is that they have always gotten what they wanted and expect to do so now, so why not? The House is certainly tripping over itself to do the industry’s bidding. Last week, it passed two more irresponsible bills accelerating drilling permits and authorizing leasing in long-protected waters of the north and central Atlantic coasts, the Southern California coast and Alaska, including Bristol Bay. It is as if the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico had never happened. It is imperative that the Senate block the House’s drilling and leasing plans, and that President Obama veto them if the Senate caves. And both the Senate and the president should keep pressing to eliminate the tax breaks. Three-fourths of Americans responding to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said they want to end them. Obviously, $4-a-gallon gas has something to do with this. But there is also an elemental matter of fairness here. As Mr. Obama put it in his radio address a week ago, when the oil companies are making huge profits and people are suffering and deficits are growing, “these tax giveaways aren’t right. They aren’t smart. And we need to end them.”With gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $100 a barrel and profits at near-record levels, it is hard to feel sympathy for the oil industry. Yet sympathy is what the C.E.O.’s of the five biggest companies asked for when they appeared Thursday before a Senate hearing on a Democratic proposal to eliminate about $2 billion in tax breaks for the Big Five.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/13oil.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">At Senate Hearing, Oil Executives Defend Tax Breaks<date>Published: May 12, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Executives of five of the largest oil companies on Thursday defended the $2.1 billion they receive each year in tax breaks, but said they would be willing to give them up as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax code.At a three-hour Senate Finance Committee hearing that was largely political theater interrupted occasionally by a serious tax policy discussion, the oil industry executives said their current tax breaks were not subsidies but legitimate tax deductions, shared in some cases with other industries. Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that the provisions, such as a tax deduction for certain types of manufacturing, were not “special incentives, preferences or subsidies for oil and gas, but rather standard deductions applied across all businesses in the United States.” He said that eliminating the provision just for the oil industry would be “misinformed and discriminatory.” Under questioning from Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the panel’s chairman, Mr. Tillerson said that he would support repeal of the manufacturing tax credit and other tax incentives, as long as all businesses were treated the same. “Repeal it for everybody, gone,” he said. “Everything for everybody everywhere ought to be on the table.” At issue was a Democratic-sponsored bill to rescind roughly $2 billion of the $4 billion in tax incentives the oil industry now enjoys annually, with the money dedicated to deficit reduction. Mr. Tillerson shared the witness stand with top executives of the four other biggest multinational oil companies, John S. Watson of Chevron; Marvin E. Odum of the United States division of Shell; H. Lamar McKay of BP America; and James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips. Collectively, the five companies reported more than $35 billion in first-quarter profits, and are on a pace to set record profits for the year. Their profits, their tax treatment and gasoline that in many areas is over $4 a gallon have made them juicy targets for Democrats seeking political points and painless revenue. The bill, which is expected to come to a vote on the Senate floor next week, is unlikely to command a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Even if it passes, it has little chance in the Republican-dominated House, which seems more inclined to provide the oil companies more access to public lands and waters than to clamp down on their tax incentives. The House passed the third of three Republican pro-drilling bills on Thursday. The measure would force the Interior Department to open large tracts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts to oil exploration and to set annual production goals. The administration and most Democrats opposed it, saying that the Deepwater Horizon accident a year ago demonstrated the dangers of offshore operations. The Senate tax bill’s chief sponsor, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, demanded that Mr. Mulva apologize for a ConocoPhillips press release on Wednesday that called the tax proposal “un-American.” “I think that’s beyond the pale,” Mr. Menendez said. “I was hoping you would come here and apologize for that.” “Nothing was intended personally,” Mr. Mulva said. “So the bottom line is you’re unwilling to apologize,” Mr. Menendez said. “So I’ll continue to take offense.” Most Republicans, along with Democratic senators from energy-producing states, appear sure to oppose the plan. One oil-state Democrat, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, said this week that oil and gas subsidies accounted for less than 13 percent of all United States energy subsidies. The ranking Republican on the finance committee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, suggested that Democrats were playing a cynical game, seeking to blame oil companies while, he asserted, intending to raise gasoline prices to force reduced consumption. “So while the American people ask Congress to do something about high gas prices,” he said, “the response of Democrats is to rail against oil executives, to mask the fact that their policy is actually to make the price at the pump more painful.” He called the hearing a “dog and pony show” and displayed a blown-up picture of a dog riding a pony, to underscore his argument that the hearing was just a chance for Democrats to score political points, without doing anything about high gas prices or a sensible energy policy. Mr. Odum of Shell said in an interview after the hearing that he was disappointed that the discussion focused on the relatively small value of the oil industry’s tax breaks and not on the broader question of how to address the deficit and expand domestic production of oil and gas. “The piece I take the most exception to, once you get past some of the theater aspects of the setting, is that it’s such a narrow view,” he said. “If the purpose is to address the deficit and the long-term health of the economy, the bigger picture is more important. And that is to produce more oil and gas and get the revenue streams and jobs from that.” Brian Knowlton contributed reporting.WASHINGTON — Executives of five of the largest oil companies on Thursday defended the $2.1 billion they receive each year in tax breaks, but said they would be willing to give them up as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax code.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/round-up-the-usual-c-e-o-s/?ref=conocophillipsinc">Round Up the Usual C.E.O.'s<date>May 11, 2011, 11:28 am</date><text>Doug Mills/The New York TimesFrom left, executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell and BP being sworn last June before testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It has been nearly a year since the chief executives of the five biggest multinational oil companies were hauled before a committee of Congress for a ritual flaying. Last June, the heads of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and ConocoPhillips were called by the House Energy and Commerce Committee to testify on the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which at the time was still pouring 50,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico. On Thursday, the same Big Five executives will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to explain why they need more than $4 billion a year in tax breaks even as they are raking in near-record profits (more than $35 billion in the first quarter of 2011 alone). The cast of characters is the same: Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil; John S. Watson of Chevron; Marvin E. Odum of the United States division of Shell; H. Lamar McKay of BP America; and James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips. These Congressional set pieces feature the dark-suited villains of the day (tobacco executives, bankers, oil company chieftains) standing in a row taking an oath to tell as much of the truth as their lawyers will allow. The legislative scorecard is mixed. The tobacco companies were brought to heel by state attorneys general, not by Congress. The Obama administration and Congress are still wrestling over bank regulation and consumer financial protection. Neither the House nor the Senate has passed comprehensive legislation dealing with offshore oil drilling. And despite the current angst over high gasoline prices, it is unlikely that Democrats can muster enough votes in both chambers to take away the oil companies’ favorable tax treatment. For those who want to follow the action, the hearing is scheduled for Thursday at 9 a.m. and can be watched at the Senate Finance Committee’s Web site.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/conocophillips-to-sell-up-to-10-billion-of-assets/?ref=conocophillipsinc">ConocoPhillips to Sell Up to $10 Billion of Assets<date>March 23, 2011, 10:10 am</date><text>ConocoPhillips announced on Wednesday that it would sell $5 billion to $10 billion of noncore assets in the next two years and use the proceeds to buy back shares and invest in its business. The move is part of a broader strategy to improve shareholder returns. In February, the company approved a $13.5 billion capital program, the bulk of which will go toward exploration and production. Only about 9 percent will be devoted to refining and marketing — activities like getting gasoline to the consumers at the pump. The company sells gasoline in Europe and the United States, mainly under the Phillips 66 and Conoco brands. “This year’s capital budget reflects our emphasis on building the upstream business,” the chief executive, James J. Mulva, said in a statement in February. “We expect competitive returns from our increased investments in North American and Australian unconventional resource projects.” The company is also involved in Canadian oil sands projects. In a related initiative, the company has been aggressively buying back shares. Last year, ConocoPhillips announced plans to buy back as much as $5 billion worth of shares. With $4 billion repurchased, ConocoPhillips said in February that it would buy back an additional $10 billion of stock. “We are executing the plan set out last year to improve returns and create value through disciplined capital spending, noncore asset sales and growing production per share,” Mr. Mulva said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our unique approach prioritizes value creation over low margin production growth and is designed to position the company for higher returns and increased shareholder distributions in the future.” In the last two years, shares of ConocoPhillips have gained more than 80 percent, outperforming rivals like BP, Chevron and Exxon Mobil as well as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/progress-reported-on-oil-plugging-system/?ref=conocophillipsinc">Progress Reported on Oil Plugging System<date>February 17, 2011, 2:06 pm</date><text>The big oil companies have a long way to go to recover from the BP well blowout that spilled millions of barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico. But on Thursday they took a step in the direction of drilling again by unveiling a new well-blowout plugging and spill containment system. Soon after the spill, a consortium organized by ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips began a $1 billion project to create such a system. An interim plan is now ready. BP later joined the group, and a final plan is expected by early 2012. The effort includes a capping stack that can fit over a leaky well, contain the leak and pour chemical dispersants over the spill. Inspectors for the Interior Department agency in charge of regulating the industry have observed testing of the cap and are reviewing test results. “We’re open for business today,” said Clay Vaughn, an ExxonMobil official and leader of the consortium. The Interior Department is not hurrying to judgment, although officials say they believe permits will be issued in the next few months. At a conference at Rice University last week, Michael Bromwich, who as head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement is the top federal regulator on offshore drilling, said the government was working cooperatively with the industry. But he expressed doubts that permitting would be as speedy in the future as it was before the BP blowout. “It would simply be irresponsible” to go forward before a new and improved containment plan was in place, he said. In a statement on Thursday, the bureau cautiously welcomed the announcement by the consortium, known as Marine Well Containment Company. “The need to demonstrate well control and containment capacity for deepwater drilling was made clear by the Macondo blowout,” a spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, said in a statement. “We appreciate Marine Well Containment Company’s significant progress to address this issue,” she said, “and we continue to encourage them to make their containment system available as quickly as possible to deepwater operators so that new, responsible oil and gas drilling in deepwater can proceed.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/business/energy-environment/11gas.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Conoco and Marathon Will Close Liquefied Natural Gas Plant<date>Published: February 10, 2011</date><text>ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil said on Thursday that they planned to shut the Kenai liquefied natural gas plant in Alaska in the coming months.Exports from Alaska could cease by April or May this year, a Conoco spokeswoman said. The small-scale plant, which has been shipping liquefied natural gas to Asia since 1969, will be mothballed for potential future use. Conoco, which operates and owns 70 percent of the plant, said “market conditions in Asia” were behind the decision to shut the plant, while Marathon, which owns the remaining 30 percent of the facility, said that domestic gas supply declines were also a factor. “The business case did not make it feasible to continue L.N.G. exports,” a Marathon spokeswoman said, adding that drilling activity in the Cook Inlet, which supplies gas to Kenai, has not offset declining production rates. “The decision to cease exports will enable us to continue to meet our contractual obligations to supply gas to the region.” Liquefied gas demand in Asia soared last year as demand in the major importers Japan and Korea recovered from recession. The greater demand was met mainly by increases in Asian and Middle Eastern production, which kept the market well supplied in 2010. Kenai exports, which rely on the use of a single tanker, remained steady. Conoco and Marathon have a license to export liquefied natural gas from Alaska to Asia until 2013, under an extension granted last year.ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil said on Thursday that they planned to shut the Kenai liquefied natural gas plant in Alaska in the coming months.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/oil-equipment-foes-stand-down-for-now/?ref=conocophillipsinc">Oil Equipment Foes Stand Down, for Now<date>January 28, 2011, 9:05 am</date><text>Rajah Bose for The New York Times Signs created by foes of shipments of oversize oil equipment were arrayed in Idaho last fall. Their leaders are now resigned to the fact that at least some of the shipments will go forward. The assemblage of residents and business owners leading an effort to block the shipment of massive oil processing equipment across northern Idaho appear to have given up — at least as it relates to shipments planned by the oil giant ConocoPhillips. “We are proud of the work we have done over the last 10 months helping educate our friends and neighbors about the threats that hundreds of megaloads pose for the communities of the Highway 12 corridor,” said Karen Hendrickson, who lives along the planned route. Ms. Hedrickson, who is known as Borg, and her husband, Linwood Laughy, have led legal and administrative challenges to the permits issued to ConocoPhillips by the state’s transportation officials. The permits allow the company to move two giant coke drums, split into a total of four shipments, across the state and into Montana, where they are destined for a refinery in Billings. The loads, which would make their way in stages, at low speeds and only at night, are gargantuan, weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds and occupying the full width of the road in both directions for over 100 miles. The company has worked with transportation officials to refine and add pull-outs along the way to permit traffic to flow at regular intervals and to minimize blockages of the road. But residents — particularly those for whom Highway 12 represents the only route in or out of the area — have argued that traffic tie-ups are inevitable, and that the megaloads would damage a highway of unique historic and environmental value. They also fear that they are witnessing the transformation of Highway 12, which traverses some of the last and largest remaining tracts of wild land in the United States, into an oversize industrial corridor. At least two other companies — Imperial Oil and Harvest Energy — have plans to move hundreds of their own megaloads along the same route, this time headed for Canada’s oil sands. Rajah Bose for The New York Times Linwood Laughy and Karen “Borg” Hendrickson have spearheaded opposition to the oil equipment shipments along this rural stretch of Highway 12 in northern Idaho. Having failed to persuade regulators in their efforts to block the four ConocoPhillips modules, Ms. Hendrickson and Mr. Laughy say they plan to focus their energy on the much larger procession of oil equipment waiting in the wings. “Our strategy now calls for a determined focus on ExxonMobil Canada’s 207 proposed shipments and others beyond these,” Ms. Hendrickson said in an e-mail. “And there are now thousands of Oregonians, Washingtonians, Montanans and Idahoans who oppose the transformation of our rural routes and tourism economies into an industrial corridor.” In a separate statement, Mr. Laughy said it was “important for local residents to understand exactly how massive these shipments are and what their impacts may be for traffic and business on Highway 12, but we do not suggest that anyone attempt to interfere with them.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/us/19brfs-GIANTTRUCKSW_BRF.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Idaho: Giant Trucks Win Permit<date>Published: January 19, 2011</date><text>Brian Ness, the state transportation director, has agreed to issue permits that would allow ConocoPhillips to begin hauling as early as next week large oil refinery machinery along a winding, scenic stretch of U.S. 12.

The Idaho Transportation Department says it will grant two permits allowing the oil company ConocoPhilips to move super-size loads of refining equipment along a winding ribbon of two-lane highway in the northern part of the state. Transport is to commence on Monday of next week, weather permitting. An array of environmental groups and local residents have fought the shipments for months, arguing, among other things, that the corridor in question adjoins some of the most pristine wilderness remaining in the lower 48 states. The road, United States Highway 12, is also part of the historic Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and cuts through Nez Perce tribal territory. But in a statement, Brian W. Ness, the director of the Idaho Transportation Department, said that the time for deliberation was over. “I am convinced the record showed the loads can be moved safely, without damage to the roads and bridges and with minimal disruption to traffic and emergency services,” Mr. Ness said. “Every argument has been heard and considered. We can no longer delay this process.” The loads, indisputably big and often referred to as “megaloads,” can weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds, stand as high as a three-story building and stretch nearly the length of a football field. The shipments would travel only at night and at low speeds, blocking traffic in both directions — although ConocoPhilips and its contracted movers have worked with transportation regulators to build and expand pull-outs along the route to minimize traffic tie-ups and to allow emergency vehicles to pass. The oil company has four such shipments planned — all destined for a refinery in neighboring Montana. Transportation officials in that state had so far been waiting to see what happens in Idaho before ruling on its own megaload permits, though they have indicated that they would grant them. Meanwhile, Imperial Oil, the Canadian division of oil giant Exxon Mobil, waits in the wings with plans to move more than 200 similarly sized modules along much of the same route to its oil sands operations in Canada. Imperial’s plans have drawn a wider audience of environmentalists who categorically oppose oil sands development to Idaho’s permitting dispute. More than 30 of Imperial’s oversize modules have already been delivered to Idaho’s Port of Lewiston, but they have been stranded as the ConocoPhillips permits are debated. A group of 13 residents and business owners seeking to block the shipments in Idaho had most recently sought to present oral arguments directly to Mr. Ness, but that hearing was evidently not granted. One of the opponents, Borg Hendrickson, who lives along U.S. 12 and who has led opposition to the shipments, largely via the Web site Fighting Goliath, said in an e-mail message, “We are saddened by the fact that the thousands of Idahoans who oppose the megaloads are having to work so hard to have one of their own state agencies hear them. Citizens’ right to question decisions made by state agencies is central to our democratic form of government.” Ms. Hendrickson said that she and her fellow opponents were weighing next steps — a fact that apparently was not lost on Mr. Ness. “I will not comment further on this case,” Mr. Ness said in his official statement on Tuesday, “because litigation is possible and because of the similarities of the pending request from Imperial Oil/Exxon Mobil to transport oversized loads on U.S. 12.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/us/25brfs-DELAYINDECIS_BRF.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Idaho: Delay in Decision on Megaloads<date>Published: December 25, 2010</date><text>The Idaho Transportation Department has postponed making a recommendation in a dispute over whether ConocoPhillips, the international oil company, can use a backcountry road, Route 12, to ship gargantuan loads of equipment to a Billings, Mont., refinery from the Port of Lewiston on the Snake River.

Critics object to giant oil-related shipments along the route. Efforts to block shipments of giant oil processing equipment along a historic stretch of Highway 12 in Idaho, which I wrote about two weeks ago, were dealt a blow by the state Supreme Court there on Monday — or so it would seem. The court overturned a lower court’s ruling in support of a lawsuit filed by three residents along the road. The lawsuit complained, among other things, that the state’s Transportation Department failed to follow its own rules in permitting the shipments, which are in some cases hundreds of feet long and three stories high and would essentially block the road as they inched along. The equipment in question — a set of new coke drums belonging to ConocoPhilips — is destined for a refinery in Billings, Mont. The companies worked with transportation officials to create pull-outs and establish a nighttime choreography for moving the equipment that they said would minimize any imposition — though many residents disagreed. In any case, the higher court argued that both it and the lower court simply lacked jurisdiction in the case — at least for now — and that opposition to the permits should have been handled by an administrative process under the auspices of the Idaho Transportation Department first. That might seem like a setback, but Borg Hendrickson, one of the residents who brought the suit, welcomed the decision. “We consider the justices’ opinion a great step forward for us,” Ms. Hendrickson said in an e-mail Tuesday afternoon. That’s because the most likely and immediate upshot of the decision is that the shipments, which have sat at Idaho’s Port of Lewiston for months, will remain frozen until public hearings can address the residents complaints. “We feel that once a full hearing is held and all the facts laid out, I.T.D. will realize that permitting the ConocoPhillips shipments, and any other megaload shipments, is not in the public’s best interest,” she said. If that’s ultimately the case, other companies, including Imperial Oil, a Canadian division of ExxonMobil, will be disappointed. They are angling to use the same route to get gigantic loads of equipment to Alberta’s tar sands. That route leads from the Port of Vancouver in Washington, up the Columbia and Snake Rivers by barge to Idaho’s Port of Lewiston, and from there across Idaho and Montana back roads to the Canadian border. Several of Imperial’s giant modules are piling up at the Port of Lewiston, too. The proposed route has stirred passions among environmentalists and climate change activists, who are loath to see Alberta’s bitumen fields — a highly polluting source of oil — further developed.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/business/energy-environment/22road.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Oil Sands Effort Turns on a Fight Over a Road<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text>KOOSKIA, Idaho — As U.S. Highway 12 hugs the serpentine banks of the Clearwater and Lochsa Rivers here, road signs bear the silhouettes of the 19th-century explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, with Mr. Lewis pointing off into the distance.He is not pointing the way for big oil companies, says Lin Laughy, whose gravel driveway abuts the road. But to Mr. Laughy’s dismay, international oil companies see this meandering, backcountry route as a road to riches. They are angling to use U.S. 12 to ship gargantuan loads of equipment from Vancouver, Wash., to Montana and the tar sands of Alberta in Canada. The companies say the route would save time and money and provide a vital economic boost to Montana and Idaho. The problem, said Mr. Laughy, is that the proposed loads are so large — and would travel so slowly — that they would literally block the highway as they rolled through. According to plans submitted to state regulators, some of the shipments would weigh more than 600,000 pounds, stand as tall as a three-story building, stretch nearly two-thirds the length of a football field and occupy 24 feet side-to-side — the full width of U.S. 12’s two lanes for much of its course through Idaho. Mr. Laughy and his wife, Borg Hendrickson, have sued the state to stop the shipments by Imperial Oil and ConocoPhillips, arguing that the loads would threaten the integrity of Idaho’s historic portion of U.S. 12, as well as the safety of communities that depend on it as the main road in and out of the area. National environmental groups and climate change activists are supporting their efforts, seeing a broader opportunity to stall development of Canada’s oil sands, which they denounce as a dirty source of energy. “If you’d asked us six months ago whether we’d be in the middle of all this, we’d have laughed,” said Mr. Laughy, 68, who has the carriage and countenance of a Santa Claus and conducts heritage tours of the area. “But we’re resigned now to the fact that there’s going to be a major war.” The companies’ plans call for the oil field equipment, manufactured in Asia, to be delivered to the port of Vancouver, then floated on barges for some 300 miles up the Columbia and Snake Rivers to Lewiston in western Idaho. From there, the equipment would inch its way along Idaho’s stretch of U.S. 12, through the Clearwater National Forest, into Montana and points beyond. Imperial Oil, the Canadian unit of ExxonMobil, hopes to move 207 separate “modules” from a manufacturer in South Korea to its $7.1 billion Kearl Lake oil sands project near Fort McMurray in Alberta. ConocoPhillips wants to transport two gigantic coke drums, manufactured in Asia and delivered to Lewiston in May, down much of the same route to a refinery in Billings, Mont. The proposed route could shave thousands of miles of transportation costs for such shipments, which might otherwise be forced to travel through the Panama Canal to overland routes accessed through Houston or New Orleans. Interstates and other wide highways are typically not an option, in part because overpasses are too low. Transportation officials in Idaho and Montana say that their roads — with some modifications made and paid for by the companies, including additional pullouts along the route and raised or buried power lines — could handle the shipments. The plan calls for the loads to move only at night and in start-and-stop fashion, going down the road for a short time, then pulling over to let other traffic pass. For Imperial Oil’s trips, it would take the trucks nine nights to cover the 510-mile route through Idaho and Montana. “We have done our level best to ensure, if given approval, that we can move these modules safely,” said Pius Rolheiser, an Imperial spokesman. Eighteen-wheelers already traverse U.S. 12 here, which serves as a gateway to the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness area, one of the largest tracts of virgin wildland in the contiguous United States. The road is also part of two national trails tracing routes followed by the Nez Perce tribe and Lewis and Clark. But Mr. Laughy, whose home sits on a ridge above U.S. 12, about 75 miles east of Lewiston, says the oil equipment is different. He points to thin margins of error along U.S. 12, where the road slices a tight path between rising rock walls on one side and a quick drop-off to the river on the other. He also fears that sooner or later, an emergency vehicle rushing toward a fire or delivering someone to a hospital will be slowed by the meandering shipments, potentially costing lives. “The companies say they have no plans to make this a permanent corridor,” he said. “But once the first shipment is allowed, what’s to stop the next one, and then the next one?” Supporters of the shipments say they would inject millions of dollars into struggling rural economies along the route. “This wouldn’t be just an economic benefit for Lewiston,” said David Doeringsfeld, manager of the Port of Lewiston, “but for all of north-central Idaho.” Mr. Doeringsfeld said he had been approached by several other companies interested in using the corridor. In May, Mr. Laughy and Ms. Hendrickson started a Web site called Fighting Goliath, which serves as a clearinghouse of information related to the megaloads, as the shipments are called. The site has since drawn the attention of regional and national environmental activists, and a movement has mobilized around the goal of stopping the loads. “I have never really seen so many people have such a unified voice against a project,” said Nick Stocks, a co-founder of Northern Rockies Rising Tide, a climate change advocacy group in Missoula, Mont., which is also on the proposed route. Environmentalists abhor Canada’s oil sands — a gooey mixture of sand, clay and bitumen that can be refined into crude oil — as an energy-intensive and highly polluting energy source that generates large amounts of greenhouse gases. But the oil sands are also one of the largest sources of foreign oil for the United States, and they are poised for further development. A proposed pipeline awaiting approval by American officials would add 1.1 million barrels of Canadian oil to the roughly two million already imported to the United States each day — much of it from the tar sands. No permits have been issued yet in Montana. But when the Idaho Transportation Department granted a permit to ConocoPhillips in August, Mr. Laughy and Ms. Hendrickson, joined by a neighbor down the road and represented by the environmental law firm Advocates for the West, promptly sued the department, arguing that it had failed to adequately consider the safety and convenience of the public, as its own rules stipulate. A lower court agreed. The case now rests with the Idaho State Supreme Court, which heard arguments on Oct. 1. and is expected to render a decision any day. Meanwhile, both sides seem confident that they will prevail. Imperial has already floated the first of its 207 modules up the river to Lewiston, and it plans to move 40 of them there by early December. Mr. Laughy, meanwhile, said that even if the court ruled against him, other obstacles — legal and physical — would probably emerge to stop the shipments. “We’re really very nice people,” Mr. Laughy said. “Unless you’re a big oil company.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/conoco-chief-says-asset-sales-may-top-10-billion/?ref=conocophillipsinc">Conoco Chief Says Asset Sales May Top $10 Billion<date>October 21, 2010, 5:04 am</date><text>ConocoPhillips may sell more assets than it initially planned as part of its two-year effort to raise cash and reduce debt, the company’s chief executive has told CNBC, according to Reuters. “We may sell more than the $10 billion,” James J.

But the directive, intended to prevent banks from making big bets for their own accounts, remains vague enough for Goldman and its Wall Street rivals to put plenty of money at risk.Investment banks can still use their own money to facilitate trades for customers. The rules envisage limiting that to the expected near-term demand for client trades. But identifying where that ends and proprietary trading begins is a blurry line. The Volcker Rule’s definition of proprietary trading is also open to interpretation. At first blush, it looks watertight: the rule forbids banks from buying and selling financial products for their “trading account.” That, in turn, is defined as an account meant to profit in the “near term” from “short term” movements in prices. That clearly knocks on the head trades that last for, say, a few days. But it’s unclear how far “near term” and “short term” are supposed to stretch. For instance, would the new rule have prohibited Morgan Stanley from placing a huge short bet on the mortgage market that lost the firm some $10 billion? That trade, though modified at times, was in place for almost a year. And banks can still trade government and agency securities for their own account. These are hardly risk free. Some of the problems at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management stemmed from trying to arbitrage prices between Treasuries of different terms. And the Carlyle Capital Corporation, a heavily leveraged debt fund, crashed in 2008 when prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds dropped. Longer-term investments aren’t ruled out either, so long as they’re not part of a private equity unit. Goldman’s special situations group, for example, sits in the firm’s fixed income division and invests in securities over a year or more. This group’s precrisis annual profit may have been as much as $1 billion. Prop trading and private equity may be dead. But long live principal investing. Big Oil, Big Gas United States oil companies are becoming less liquid — but not in a financial sense. With natural gas so plentiful, Big Oil is fast becoming Big Gas. Shareholders may be underestimating the impact of the shift on future returns while an unexpected advantage is tipping to the oiliest majors. America’s energy titans are finding it increasingly difficult to ramp up oil output. Exxon Mobil is on track to pump 5 percent less this year than in 2005, according to Barclays Capital forecasts. Instead, the company has turned to gas for growth. A big project in Papua New Guinea and its acquisition of XTO Energy are accelerating the shift. Gas, which accounted for 38 percent of Exxon’s output in 2005, could account for up to 48 percent next year. Exxon isn’t alone. Two rivals, ConocoPhillips and, to a lesser extent, Chevron, are also expanding in gas. The trend looks ominous. Oil offers fatter margins and, in the United States, sells for almost three times more than gas for the same quantity of energy. Drillers are partly victims of their own success, with new techniques raising gas reserves and driving down prices. Meanwhile, lawmakers have ditched proposals for a carbon tax, which had promised to spur demand for cleaner-burning gas. The gas market is not so grim everywhere. Multidecade contracts for liquefied natural gas in Asia are typically hooked to oil and so can fetch double the price in the United States. That helps Chevron in particular. But even overseas markets look less safe over the long run. The same drilling innovations that led to plunging prices in North America are being plied in Germany, Poland and China. Meanwhile other monster gas projects in Qatar and Australia are expected by the International Energy Agency to increase output by 50 percent by 2013. With even Chevron drifting toward gas, Occidental Petroleum, which still gets 75 percent of its output from black gold, might wind up the last of the majors deserving the moniker Big Oil. Its stock is costlier than its three biggest rivals, trading at 14 times expected 2010 earnings compared with an average of about 9.5 times. But its significantly lower exposure to gas justifies the premium, and then some.

Bobby Jindal, a Republican, has called the Obama administration’s moratorium on offshore drilling “a second man-made disaster”; fishermen mourn the destruction of their way of life and defend Big Oil in the same breath; environmentalists call for restoring the battered coastline, not changing the national energy policy. So when Patty Whitney, a community organizer here in Terrebonne Parish, asked a question at a recent conference about the state of the Louisiana coast, it was all she could do to keep her voice from shaking. “We are constantly told, ‘You have to adapt to coastal land loss, you have to adapt because of the oil leak, you have to adapt to the new situation,’ ” she said. “When is our government going to adapt to new energy sources that aren’t harmful to our environment and the people who depend upon the environment?” On the stage, the panel of engineers and environmental policy makers looked at one another. “Who would like to take that question?” the moderator asked. The conference was financed by the state and by private donors — including the oil conglomerate ConocoPhillips, one of the region’s biggest landowners. “You must be very brave,” another attendee, a professor at a local university, told Ms. Whitney during the break. “Or very dumb,” she replied. Born and raised in Houma, one of a family of 10, Ms. Whitney, 58, has long considered herself a closet radical when it comes to oil. Her mission at the grass-roots interfaith group Bisco is to help the disparate and largely disenfranchised groups in this region — African-Americans, Cajuns, American Indians — develop a political voice. As such, she has tried to keep her own mostly to herself. But that is not easy for a Southerner with a gift of gab, a self-taught historian and a mother of three who takes umbrage at how the sugar companies, the fur companies and the oil companies have each come to the region and extracted its bounty. “America needs oil, Patty,” a brother who is an engineer for an oil company told her at a recent family gathering. “Then let them drill,” she retorted. “Let them drill in Yellowstone Park, in the Grand Canyon, in Puget Sound, off Martha’s Vineyard. Let them mess up their own places instead of just drilling in my beautiful Louisiana.” And the spill, whose scope is still unknown, has prompted snippets of surprising conversations on the subject, even as the Senate on Thursday scrapped plans to take up a major climate change bill. Someone in church heard Ms. Whitney talking about the benefits of wind power the other week and signaled his agreement. Same with a woman in one of her community organizing networks. “It’s at the point where people would consider talking about it, where before it was close to blasphemy,” Ms. Whitney said. “Me personally, I really and truly think the time is here, that even though it’s radical for this area, the idea of developing an alternative energy policy has come.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E5D61031F931A15754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=conocophillipsinc">4 Oil Firms Commit $1 Billion For Gulf Rapid-Response Plan<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>Four of the world's biggest oil companies said on Wednesday that they were committing $1 billion to create a rapid-response system to deal with deepwater oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, seeking to restore public confidence in the industry after the BP disaster painfully exposed how unprepared the industry was for a major accident. The voluntary effort, which involves building a set of modular containment equipment that would be kept on standby for emergency use, comes as oil companies seek to persuade the Obama administration to lift a temporary ban on deepwater drilling. The moratorium was imposed after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 and spewed millions of gallons of oil into the gulf. Officials said the spill served as a wake-up call for the industry, which had invested billions of dollars to develop oil and gas resources in ever-deeper waters offshore but neglected to devise spill-response technology that could be effective in thousands of feet of water. Environmentalists, members of Congress and federal and state officials have already made it clear that the industry will face tougher regulations when drilling resumes. The emergency response plan is part of the oil industry's effort to show it can improve its safety procedures and shape the inevitable rules of conduct that will be imposed. The plan -- which was put together by Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell -- incorporates many of the lessons that BP was forced to learn the hard way in trying to cap a gushing oil well 5,000 feet below the ocean's surface. The four companies said their initiative would seek to include all the companies involved in offshore drilling in the gulf, including BP. Their initial financing of $250 million each will be used to build a set of containment equipment, like underwater systems and pipelines, that will be able to deal with a variety of deepwater problems and can be deployed rapidly in the event of a spill. The partners said it would take six months to get all the elements in place. The companies expect the system will be able to contain spills in water as deep as 10,000 feet and capture up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day, although that capacity could be increased if needed. ''It's doubtful we will ever use it, but this is a risk-management gap we need to fill in order for the government and the public to be confident to allow us to get back to work,'' Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman of Exxon, said in an interview. Critically, the new system is expected to be deployed within 24 hours of an offshore spill, and to be able to fully contain the oil spilled within weeks, said Sara Ortwein, a vice president of engineering at Exxon, which has taken the lead in setting up the spill plan. A new nonprofit entity, called the Marine Well Containment Company, will be created and be in charge of operating and maintaining this emergency capability. The entity, modeled in part after the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which was set up after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, will also finance research to look into new ways of tackling an underwater spill. It has taken BP nearly three months to finally cap its gushing oil well in the gulf, after repeated failures to plug the well using a series of jury-rigged devices. While drilling two relief wells to permanently seal its damaged well, BP has relied on inflatable booms, chemical dispersants, containment vessels and controlled burning to address the spill. ''One thing that has become clear is that we need to have a system that is flexible, adaptable and available for rapid response,'' Ms. Ortwein said in an interview. Oil companies hope the initiative, the product of four weeks of intensive efforts involving 40 engineers from the four companies, will help persuade government regulators and the administration to allow them to resume offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as soon as possible. Oil companies are also seeking to deflect a series of bills being considered in Congress -- including one proposal that would force companies to drill a second well, called a relief well, alongside any new exploration well. Oil executives argue that such a proposal would not enhance safety offshore, but instead would double the risk because a relief well would be just as likely to blow up as an exploration well. The Interior Department agency that oversees deepwater drilling said Wednesday that the industry's new response plan was a ''move in the right direction.'' ''The BP oil spill has made it clear that oil and gas companies did not have the sufficient containment capacity to respond to a major spill,'' Michael R. Bromwich, the director of the department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said in a statement. ''We are encouraged that a number of companies recognize this issue and are taking steps to correct it.'' However, oil companies still face considerable skepticism about their ability to operate safely in the gulf. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of the industry's most vocal critics, described the plan as ''BP's current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint.'' When top oil executives appeared before Congress several weeks ago, Mr. Markey and other lawmakers forced them to admit that their spill response plans were outdated and woefully inadequate. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who has opposed the drilling moratorium, said Wednesday that the industry's initiative was badly needed. ''It is clear that we simply cannot afford three months of trial and error ever again,'' she said in a statement. The initiative is the first product of a larger discussion within the industry on how to improve safety in the gulf. Oil companies have set up an industrywide task force to consider new safety standards for offshore drilling, more frequent rig inspections, new requirements and certification for blowout preventers and improvements in well design. Frank Verrastro, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said an updated approach to safety in the gulf was overdue. ''Companies have used their technology to get into the deep water but they didn't have an adequate plan to intervene at these depths or to contain a large-scale spill,'' he said.

Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil. “It certainly appears that not all the standards that we would recommend or that we would employ were in place,” said John S. Watson, chairman of Chevron. “It’s not a well that we would have drilled in that mechanical setup,” said Marvin E. Odum, president of Shell. The hearing was an opportunity for three dozen members of Congress to vent their frustration at top executives of the world’s largest privately owned oil companies. The occasion was reminiscent of the 1994 hearing before a panel of the same committee — the House Energy and Commerce Committee — at which the chief executives of the major tobacco companies were ritually grilled on the dangers of their products. Top banking executives recently got the same treatment. The oil company leaders presented a similar tableau on Tuesday — a group of middle-aged, dark-suited executives raising their right hands in preparation for nearly five hours of hostile interrogation. Democrats generally were seeking confessions of error and expressions of regret. Republicans focused more on the economic impact of the spill and the moratorium on most offshore drilling that President Obama imposed in the aftermath of the disaster. They sought assurances that deepwater drilling could resume safely. But even some Republicans were moved to join the attack on Lamar McKay, president of BP America and designated scapegoat of the day, who was seated at the witness table with the other executives. Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida, told Mr. McKay that he should resign; another Republican, Representative Joseph Cao of Louisiana, said, “In samurai days, we would just give you a knife and ask you to commit hara-kiri.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee that convened the hearing, demanded that Mr. McKay apologize for what Mr. Markey termed the incompetence and deceit that led to consistently low estimates of the size of the spill and the resulting damage. After weaving for a bit, Mr. McKay said meekly: “We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through. We are sorry for that and for the spill.” He refused repeated requests that he promise to place billions of dollars of BP’s profits in an escrow fund to pay damage claims, as members of Congress and Mr. Obama have demanded. “I cannot commit today one way or another to a fund,” he said. “We said we’ll honor all legitimate claims, and the full company stands behind that.” Until now, the other major oil companies had provided technical assistance to BP and refrained from criticizing the company’s handling of the disaster. Even as they watched their offshore rigs idled and their stock values fall, they had presented a united front. But that unity crumbled Tuesday before the House committee, mirroring growing private frustration with being linked to BP. Some executives have been angered at BP’s efforts to paint the gulf accident as an industrywide problem that will require industrywide reforms. The executives of the other companies asserted Tuesday that they believed BP was an outlier, cutting corners to save time and money in ways that they would not tolerate. The BP spill came just as the industry was about to realize a long-awaited goal of expanding offshore drilling to new parts of the gulf, the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Arctic. That is now all in question. Although most of the Congressional fire was aimed at BP on Tuesday, the other executives came under criticism as well, particularly for the response plans that they prepared for a major spill in the gulf. The five companies submitted virtually identical plans to government regulators and to the committee. The 500-page document, prepared by a private contractor, refers to measures to protect walruses and gives a phone number for a marine biologist who died five years ago. James J. Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the citations were “certainly an embarrassment to Conoco,” adding, “Plans need to be updated more frequently.” Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, noted that each of the companies said it had planned for a much larger spill than the BP accident, even though it is clear that even a spill of the current size is beyond any company’s ability to handle. “BP failed miserably when confronted with a real leak,” Mr. Waxman said, “and Exxon Mobil and the other companies would do no better.” Mr. Tillerson admitted that the only way to deal with major spills was to keep them from occurring. “The point is,” he said, “we have to take every step to prevent these things from happening, because when they happen we are not well equipped to prevent any and all damage. There will be damage. There is no response capability that will ensure that you won’t have an impact.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/berkshire-posts-3-6-billion-1st-quarter-profit/?ref=conocophillipsinc">Berkshire Posts $3.6 Billion 1st-Quarter Profit<date>May 1, 2010, 12:43 pm</date><text>Berkshire Hathaway has rebounded from last year’s first-quarter loss and earned $3.6 billion as the economic recovery began and the conglomerate absorbed the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, The Associated Press reported on Saturday. Warren E. Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive, shared preliminary first-quarter results with shareholders Saturday at Berkshire’s annual meeting. The full report will be released Friday. Last year’s $1.5 billion loss included a $241 million loss on the sale of investments and a $1.9 billion charge from writing down a ConocoPhillips investment. The addition of Burlington Northern more than doubled Berkshire’s regulated businesses unit income, to $555 million. The unit also includes utilities. Mr. Buffett said Berkshire’s results showed the economy was improving because manufacturing and retail income grew 85 percent, to $477 million.

Exxon's earnings fell below Wall Street forecasts, in stark contrast to BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which both exceeded market expectations when they released quarterly figures this week. Oil prices averaged nearly $79 a barrel in the first quarter, about $3 more than the previous quarter and sharply higher than the $43 average of the first quarter of 2009. That strength offset weak margins from Exxon and Conoco's refinery operations, which have been hurt by slow demand for fuels like gasoline and diesel because of the soft global economy. A steady rebound in many regions, however, is expected to pull up fuel demand later this year. ''Our results reflect higher crude oil realizations and stronger chemical margins while the downstream industry margins remained weak,'' Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday. Exxon's profit in the quarter rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share. Wall Street analysts had expected Exxon to report a profit of $1.41 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Jason Gammel, oil analyst at Macquarie Research, characterized Exxon's first-quarter profit as a ''pretty big miss,'' and attributed the bulk of the shortfall to Exxon's accrual for the health care legislation. A charge the company took against the health care legislation cut earnings by $200 million, or about 4 cents a share. The company's oil equivalent production rose 4.5 percent from a year ago, helped by its liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar, it said. But Exxon's downstream arm, which includes its refining and marketing operations, posted profits of $37 million, well off the $1.1 billion it earned a year ago. Shares of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., fell 53 cents, to $68.66. Conoco's profits rose to $2.1 billion, or $1.40 a share, from $800 million, or 54 cents a share, but oil and gas output in terms of oil equivalent per day during the quarter fell to 1.83 million barrels, from 1.93 million barrels a year earlier. Revenue rose to $45.8 billion, from $31.2 billion. Conoco, which is in the middle of a plan to shore up returns and reduce debt by selling $10 billion in assets, said in its conference call that it expected oil and gas output to be lower for the next several quarters. Shares of Conoco, which is based in Houston, rose 55 cents, to $59.10. Conoco's chief executive, Jim Mulva, said the company may increase its 2010 spending plan from about $11 billion to $12 billion, with investments in assets like the Eagleford and Bakken Shales that bring higher returns.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/business/30views.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Berkshire Hathaway’s Derivatives Exposure<date>Published: April 29, 2010</date><text>Warren Buffett says he loves simple things like ice cream. But some 40,000 shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Nebraska this weekend may hear a lot about complex derivatives.For someone who once called these instruments “financial weapons of mass destruction,” the Oracle of Omaha has accumulated quite a portfolio. He has sold “put” options on various equity indexes and some credit default protection too, with an exposure of up to $63 billion. Realistically, the market value of Berkshire’s derivatives liabilities stood at around $9 billion at the end of last year. But when Berkshire first issued the contracts, it banked premiums nearly as large as those liabilities in 2009. It is churning out $8 billion in annual free cash flow, according to Barclays Capital. And Berkshire’s equity is measured in multiples of its debt, not the other way around. As Mr. Buffett may indicate on Saturday, this makes the derivatives risk look modest, unlike the disastrously oversize exposures built up by highly leveraged financial institutions like the American International Group. Mr. Buffett may well also break his recent silence on Goldman Sachs. The billionaire sank $5 billion into the investment bank during the financial crisis. But now, a complex derivatives-based deal has led to fraud charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman disputes the accusations, but its reputation is taking a battering; the drop in the company’s share price has so far cost Berkshire about $1 billion. Shareholders this weekend may ask Mr. Buffett about his thoughts on financial regulatory reform. As far as derivatives go, there’s a risk of Berkshire’s being forced to post billions in collateral on existing trades — something that they were devised to avoid and that Mr. Buffett’s crew has lobbied against. New rules could also crimp Goldman’s activities. Mr. Buffett may feel that new curbs are inevitable. In his most recent annual letter, he said those running financial institutions needed to take more responsibility. If Berkshire takes too much risk on derivatives or otherwise, and runs into trouble, he said, “it will be my fault.” Wall Street’s leading lights still tend to argue they never saw the crisis coming. Mr. Buffett may well have pungent views about that, too. Easing of Oil Losses The doubling of crude prices since last year isn’t the only thing giving a healthy glow to earnings of big oil companies. The refining sector, which splattered ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips in red ink last year, is finally improving. Exploration and production profits are able to take center stage. At the end of 2009, refining was a nightmare. Crack spreads — the margin refiners are paid to turn crude into usable fuel — had slimmed to anorexic proportions. The pain was more intense for firms that had invested heavily in refiners able to transform even stubborn lower-quality crude, which can typically be snapped up at a large discount. As producers of heavier crude in OPEC nations and Canada scaled back production, their advantage dwindled and has all but disappeared. With global demand reviving, refiners worldwide are slowly being freed from this headlock. The greatest sigh of relief is coming from ConocoPhillips, the most exposed of the large American oil companies. Refining losses of $215 million slashed more than 10 percent off profit in the final quarter of 2009. Coming close to breakeven on refining in the fourth quarter seems a merciful release. With this burden removed and its $10 billion asset sale program off to a roaring start, the company looks positively hardy. Exxon Mobil, where refining stripped $189 million from fourth-quarter profit, actually turned a modest profit of $37 million. The company’s refining business — with its hefty exposure to the more robust Chinese market — looks better placed still. It was to non-American cracking that Exxon owed its return to refining profitability. Refining won’t be easy for a while. Much of the new demand from gas-guzzling Americans is likely to be met by ethanol, which will benefit from government edicts. But stabilizing the refining business will at least allow the big oil firms to capture more of the benefits from high crude prices. For those like Exxon with heavy Asian exposure, refining may even start to be a business in which investors take pride.

The three companies cited concerns over the direction that climate change legislation has taken in Congress. Oil companies are particularly upset about concessions Congress has made to the coal and utility industries. In separate statements, BP America, ConocoPhillips and Caterpillar said Tuesday that they were discontinuing membership in the lobbying group, which includes corporate giants like Alcoa and DuPont, and influential environmental organizations like the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. In a statement that played down the significance of the departures, the Climate Action Partnership said that ''all three companies have provided invaluable assistance, expertise and significant commitments of time and resources'' in seeking to advance climate legislation. In the proposed legislation, Congress granted free emission allowances to coal-burning utilities to forestall the possibility of huge increases in electric bills. Oil companies, by contrast, would have to pay for their emissions if the bill became law, most likely driving up the price of gasoline. (The legislation is stalled at the moment on Capitol Hill, though the Obama administration is trying to revive it.) James J. Mulva, the chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said Tuesday that ''House climate legislation and Senate proposals to date have disadvantaged the transportation sector and its consumers, left domestic refineries unfairly penalized versus international competition, and ignored the critical role that natural gas can play in reducing'' greenhouse gas emissions. BP echoed that view, with a spokesman, Ronnie Chappell, saying the company believes it can do more to influence the outcome of pending House and Senate legislation on its own. ''Our views are that there are segments of the economy that are largely untouched or aren't carrying as big a piece of the burden that they might,'' he said. Caterpillar said it would spend its energy on new technologies that could help to cut emissions.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/business/global/01gas.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Canadian Board Approves Western Gas Pipeline<date>Published: December 31, 2009</date><text>HOUSTON  A long-delayed natural gas pipeline in Western Canada, which has the potential to provide significant amounts of energy to North America, has cleared a crucial hurdle by receiving the endorsement of a Canadian government review panel.

Some Indian communities and environmental groups have called the 750-mile pipeline a threat to local species and native cultures and have expressed concern about the greenhouse emissions created if the gas is used to heat and upgrade oil sands into usable fuels. Greenhouse emissions from oil sands are substantially higher than from conventional oil and gas production. But the joint review panel, after five years of study, concluded late Wednesday that the project “would deliver valuable and lasting overall benefits and avoid significant adverse environmental impacts.” It continued, “The project itself, as long-term infrastructure, provides a key basis for future economic development.” The National Energy Board and federal cabinet still need to approve the project, but they are expected to follow the recommendations of the review panel. The board is scheduled to hold hearings in April. If the project is approved, the oil companies would then have to decide whether to build the pipeline, given the current low gas prices, the prospects for competing gas fields in western Canada and the uncertainty of financial support from the Canadian government. Furthermore, a competing and also delayed gas pipeline project in Alaska might overtake the Canadian project. “If the oil companies think prices are firming on gas, they will go ahead with this,” said Donald Hertzmark, a consultant who advises energy companies on international projects. “It could still be important for the United States and Canada, especially if gas takes off as a transportation fuel or if environmental issues slow down or derail the development of shale gas resources.” The oil companies originally filed applications for the project in 2004, and hoped to begin operations five years later. But the review panel took longer than expected to complete its study. Now gas industry experts say operations could start in 2014 at the earliest. The review panel, which assessed the environmental and socioeconomic impacts, concluded that the pipeline would not harm fish in the Mackenzie River. But it called for regional planning to protect many species including polar bears, caribou and beluga whales. It also recommended that the gas be used to replace coal-fired electrical generation to control greenhouse gas emissions that have been linked to global climate change. The three gas fields that the pipeline would connect have reserves that are estimated at six trillion cubic feet  an amount equal to more than two years of total Canadian consumption of gas. The pipeline would initially supply about one billion cubic feet a day, which could be expanded after future offshore and onshore drilling. The United States Energy Department has projected that Canadian annual gas consumption will increase from 3.3 trillion cubic feet in 2006 to 4.7 trillion cubic feet in 2030, largely because of the expanding needs of the oil sands industry. Production in Canada’s conventional natural gas fields have been in decline, along with exports to the United States.

Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp ConocoPhillips Inc Deutsche Bank AG Go to your Portfolio » Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, appears already to have side-stepped Conoco’s pivotal error: timing. Just a day after the Burlington deal was announced, gas prices hit a record $15.78 per thousand cubic feet. Consequently, by the time Conoco pounced, Burlington shares had already gained 90 percent that year, making them the sixth best performer in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index.

Saddled with debt taken on to buy Burlington, Conoco is now trying to dispose of $10 billion of assets in what appears to be a buyer’s market. The deal ultimately led to more than $30 billion in write-downs for Conoco, by Deutsche Bank’s tally. Contrast that with Exxon’s swoop on XTO. Even including Exxon’s healthy premium, XTO shares are still more than 30 percent below their June 2008 high. Meanwhile, XTO’s shrewd hedging will shield Exxon from the grim outlook for gas prices at least until 2011, by which time demand may have picked up. Infelicitous timing isn’t the only factor that sabotaged the Burlington deal. Conoco failed to keep key managers like Randy Limbacher, the highly regarded chief operating officer, and the heads of production in the United States and Canada. Many of them drifted back to independent explorers. By setting up a separate unconventional gas unit at XTO’s home base in Fort Worth, Tex., Exxon seems determined not to squeeze out talent. In any event, given Exxon’s track record in the industry, it seems odd that investors are not giving its management the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, they can thank Conoco for handing them some valuable lessons in what not to do. A Lehman Ruling Lehman Brothers’ creditors are being sorted into haves and have-nots. Fifteen months after the investment bank collapsed, London’s High Court has ruled that cash held on behalf of clients can be returned only if it was properly segregated from Lehman’s own money. Clients whose money should have been separated, but wasn’t, have been left out in the cold. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm administering the bankruptcy of Lehman’s British arm, has identified $2.1 billion of cash that was definitely ring-fenced. But former clients and affiliates of Lehman argued that a further $3 billion should have been segregated under the British financial regulator’s rules. That claim has been dismissed. A collection of hedge funds that lost out will appeal. If they fail, they will have to join the queue of unsecured creditors. Goldman Sachs and the hedge fund firm GLG Partners are among the winners from the ruling. It is not clear whether that was a result of luck or shrewd renegotiation of their agreements with Lehman as it got into trouble. The fact that two of Europe’s most powerful fund managers have ended up on the right side of the judgment suggests the latter. But even clients whose money was properly segregated may not be repaid in full. PricewaterhouseCoopers has warned of a $1 billion shortfall if German administrators refuse to release funds transferred to Lehman’s German subsidiary shortly before its demise. The Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, does not emerge well from this episode. It had rules in place that should have protected client money, but they were not properly enforced. Still, there are encouraging signs that the British authorities have learned from the Lehman events. The government’s new paper on dealing with failing investment banks includes a whole chapter on safeguarding client assets. That may be scant consolation for funds left on the wrong side of the High Court judgment. They have learned their lesson the hard way.

They have slashed costs, shed employees and pared high-cost investments made when prices were rising. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Royal Dutch Shell Plc Go to your Portfolio » As oil prices have fallen, so have corporate earnings. Exxon Mobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded oil company, and Royal Dutch Shell, the top European company, both reported sharp declines in third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The plunge in profits occurred amid a recovery in oil prices, which had fallen as low as $34 a barrel in December from their peak of $147 a barrel last summer. On Thursday, oil closed at $79.87 a barrel in New York trading, up $2.41. The rebound has been a relief for producers. While prices remain historically high, the industry has been squeezed because of investment decisions made while oil was rising. Today, few petroleum executives imagine returning to a world where oil trades at $20 a barrel, the average throughout the 1990s. In fact, a level of $65 to $75 a barrel is increasingly viewed as a new minimum for the industry. If prices settle below that range, many oil executives say they will find it difficult to expand production or invest in new exploration projects. While most of its big competitors have been restructuring operations and cutting expenses, Exxon said it would stick with its plans to spend $25 billion to $30 billion a year over the next few years to develop new energy supplies. The company said that its profits in the third quarter declined 68 percent, to $4.73 billion, or 98 cents a share, falling short of analysts’ expectations. That compared with earnings of $14.83 billion a year ago, the company’s best quarter. “We’re not in a panic mode,” said Kenneth P. Cohen, Exxon’s vice president for public affairs, in a conference call with reporters. Exxon became the world’s most profitable corporation in 2008, earning $45 billion as oil averaged $100 a barrel. Exxon’s shares traded down for much of the day on Thursday after the company’s profit came in below forecasts of $1.06 a share. But the stock ended the day up 12 cents at $73.96. Exxon posted a loss at its American refining business for the second consecutive quarter. The company said that its spending in the quarter fell by 5 percent compared with last year, to $6.5 billion. Its oil and gas production in the period rose by 3 percent. “Despite ongoing global economic weakness and reduced demand for products, we continued our robust investment program and delivered strong results,” Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Shell’s net income fell to $3.25 billion from $8.45 billion in the same period last year. In London, Shell shares fell 55 pence, or 2.9 percent, to 1,856 pence. “We see some indications that energy demand and pricing are improving but the outlook remains very uncertain, and we are not expecting a quick recovery,” Peter Voser, Shell’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. Shell has outlined a sharp cost-cutting program in recent months. It is eliminating 5,000 jobs, about 10 percent of its work force, and merging some units. The company said that as part of its restructuring efforts, it would take a charge in the fourth quarter that might total “several hundred millions of dollars” because of the job cuts. The company said it had reduced operating costs by about $1 billion in the first nine months of the year. Similar efforts are already paying off at BP, the British oil giant. The company reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday after beating its own cost-reduction targets and increasing output. Higher oil prices in recent years meant that oil companies increased their spending on more expensive exploration efforts, such as oil sands, to increase production. They were also forced to raise spending as costs throughout the industry doubled from 2004 to 2008. But as prices fell, oil majors as well as independent producers across the country have struggled to adapt. They have capped wells that have become uneconomical, for example, and in Canada, heavy oil projects have been put on hold. While oil prices have dropped 45 percent since their peak last summer, costs have fallen by only 15 to 20 percent since last year’s peak, said Patrick de la Chevardière, chief financial officer of the French oil giant Total. Conoco Phillips, for example, said it would reduce its capital expenses by 12 percent next year, and planned to sell assets worth $10 billion over the next two years. Conoco said on Wednesday that its third-quarter profits fell 71 percent, to $1.5 billion. Eni, the giant Italian oil company, slashed its dividend by 23 percent over the summer, in part to protect its spending program, but the move stunned investors who have long been accustomed to the industry’s policy of paying high dividends. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, will report earnings on Friday. The picture is not entirely grim. Companies have made large discoveries this year. BP announced a major offshore find in the Gulf of Mexico last month, while Anadarko Petroleum and its partners said they had identified a major offshore petroleum basin running from Ghana to Sierra Leone. But oil companies must run faster just to stand still. More than 3.5 million barrels a day of new capacity must be added each year to offset the normal decline of old fields around the world. Some of that can be done by stimulating existing fields to pump more oil; some by investing in new capacity in already-discovered reserves, such as in Saudi Arabia; and some through well-head exploration.

Today’s price of around $70 a barrel is increasingly viewed as a new floor for the industry. Below that level, oil executives warn that they will find it difficult to expand production or invest in new exploration projects. Few petroleum executives imagine returning to a world where oil prices trade at $20 a barrel, their average throughout the 1990s. In fact, many are saying that spending in the industry has been crimped and projects have been delayed since oil prices dropped from last year’s highs. Companies are feeling the crunch throughout the industry. ConocoPhillips, for example, said recently that it would cut its capital budget by 12 percent next year, and planned to sell assets worth $10 billion over the next two years to reduce its debt ratios. During the summer, Eni, the giant Italian oil company, slashed its dividend by 23 percent, in part to protect its spending program. The move stunned investors who have long been accustomed to the industry’s policy of paying ever-higher dividends. Smaller independent energy producers across the United States have capped wells that have become uneconomical. In Canada, heavy oil projects have been put on hold. Even Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, required contractors to lower their bids for new refineries in the kingdom. “There is a new tone in the industry,” said Paul Horsnell, an energy expert at Barclays Capital. “At $70, the patient is still breathing. It’s not a boom, but it’s enough to keep things ticking. At $60 or below, the patient is on life support.” “The $65 to $75 range has been no accident at all,” Mr. Horsnell said. “It’s what’s needed to keep the patient alive.” The concern is widely shared. The steady rise in oil prices over the past years came to an abrupt end with the financial crisis last year. After oil peaked at $147 a barrel in New York in July 2008, prices collapsed within a few months, falling to a low of $34 a barrel by December. Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni, said that he expected oil prices to hover around $65 to $75 a barrel over the next five to seven years, a level he described as “low.” Some analysts are forecasting that oil could once again rise above $100 a barrel in the next few years as a result of renewed economic growth from China and elsewhere. “If prices rise above $65, we will be happy,” Mr. Scaroni said, “but we don’t count on it in our planning.” Oil prices jumped above $75 a barrel last week, their highest level in a year. Many factors explain this new reality. Much of the “cheap oil” that can be extracted and developed at low cost lies in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and along the rest of the Gulf, where it is mostly beyond the reach of international oil companies for various political or safety reasons. Elsewhere, as in Venezuela or Russia, which both hold substantial reserves, stricter government policies have made it difficult for companies to invest in recent years. In Brazil, which traditionally had been open to investors, the government has recently decided to tighten access to its promising offshore region, granting preferential treatment to its domestic industry. Even in the United States, companies say they are constricted. Royal Dutch Shell paid more than $2 billion to acquire offshore exploration leases in the Arctic region north of Alaska a few years ago but has yet to drill a well because of legal hurdles. The U.S. Congress is also considering rescinding tax credits and other favorable policies — moves that would essentially increase taxes on oil producers. “Any new taxes will hurt,” said Lamar McKay, the chairman and president of BP America. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »NEW YORK — After years of volatility, oil prices have found a level that seems to satisfy producing nations, oil companies and major consumers.

The single successful contract went to a joint venture of BP and the China National Petroleum Corporation for the largest field offered: Rumaila, near the southern city of Basra, which has proven reserves of more than 17 billion barrels. The auction, celebrated by the Iraqi government as a milestone for the fledgling democracy, came on the same day as the deadline for American combat troops to pull out of Iraqi cities. It is the most significant attempt to open up the country’s oil industry since it was nationalized by Saddam Hussein in 1972, and the centerpiece of a plan to raise oil production to 6 million barrels a day by 2015, from the current level of 2.4 million. Instead of garnering an infusion of foreign cash to rebuild and to prop up its limping economy, however, the auction of fields that contain about 80 percent of Iraq’s oil output appeared to further polarize the country. Four of the eight oil and gas fields offered Tuesday received only a single bid from oil corporations, and an undeveloped gas field in violence-plagued Diyala Province in northwest Iraq received none. “These oil companies want to make as much money as they can, so they submitted low bids,” Hussain al-Shahristani, the country’s embattled oil minister, said during a news conference following the auction. “But I sent them a message that there are people in Iraq who are protecting Iraq’s wealth.” But observers said the event could be deemed a success only if viewed strictly in populist political terms, because foreign presence in Iraq’s oil industry is a contentious issue. Many believe the 2003 American-led invasion was carried out to wrest away Iraq’s enormous oil reserves, the third largest in the world after Saudi Arabia’s and Iran’s. Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum Web site, which covers the country’s oil industry, said what remained unresolved was how Iraq was to modernize its oil industry without giving in to the desires of oil companies, which prefer owning a share of the oil they pump. Iraq has so far rejected such arrangements, which are known as production sharing agreements. Iraq has an estimated 9 percent of the world’s crude oil, but its pipelines and other infrastructure are aging. Many of its most productive fields, laced with water because of mismanagement, are no longer able to produce as much oil as they once did. The country lacks the money to rebuild the industry, which accounts for almost all of its foreign earnings. The auction on Tuesday, held in a heavily secured ballroom at the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad’s Green Zone, was reminiscent of a professional sports draft lottery. Bids were placed inside a large plastic box that had been set up on a stage. The oil companies were given 20 minutes to mull over each oil and gas field, with the time shown counting down on a giant video screen. The sight of executives walking onstage to drop sealed bids in the plastic box brought cheers of delight from Oil Ministry employees in the audience. The executives themselves, representing Exxon Mobil, Lukoil, Japex, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and the Korea Gas Corporation, among others, then stood aside as their offers were displayed on a screen before the bids were compared to those of rival companies seeking the same contract. The Oil Ministry said it chose to conduct its business on television and in front of an audience of reporters and others to combat allegations of widespread corruption in the ministry, which led it to cancel a group of no-bid oil contracts last year. Major oil companies had little interest in the terms of those contracts, either. Because the financial risk of a 20-year investment in Iraq was considered to be too great for even the largest oil corporations, the companies for the most part formed joint ventures. Throughout the day, clusters of men in dark suits spoke to each other in their common language: broken English, with Dutch, Chinese, Russian and Thai accents. A member of a Korean delegation wore a flak vest inside the hotel ballroom. The only successful bidders, BP and the China National Petroleum Corporation, will negotiate with the Oil Ministry through the summer to complete a contract to revive the Rumaila oil field. Iraq says only about a million barrels of oil a day are pumped from Rumaila  far less than the 1.75 million barrels the government believes that the field should be producing, and little more than one-third of the 2.85 million barrels that BP and the Chinese company say they can extract. The companies had originally requested a premium of $3.99 for every barrel of oil they produced over an Iraqi government-established baseline, but the government offered only $2. While the companies finally agreed to the government’s price, it was the only time all day that the usually wide gaps between what the government was willing to pay and what the companies said they needed to be paid were bridged.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio TransCanada Corporation ConocoPhillips Inc BP Plc Go to your Portfolio » The participation of Exxon, which holds the largest natural gas reserves on Alaska’s North Slope, lends credibility to a plan by TransCanada that last year won Alaska’s competition to build a 1,700-mile pipeline. It also deals a blow to a rival project from BP and ConocoPhillips and introduces more uncertainty into one of Alaska’s biggest political and economic debates. The competition to build a gas pipeline was set up by Gov. Sarah Palin, who had been critical of the slow pace at which oil companies, including Exxon, were moving. Financial details of Exxon’s participation were sketchy on Thursday, but TransCanada said it would retain the majority interest in the project. Both companies essentially invited BP and Conoco to abandon their rival effort, saying they would be welcome to join the TransCanada plan. “It has always been our position that the project will require the support of all the North Slope producers, the state of Alaska and TransCanada, and we will need to work with them,” Marty Massey, a senior executive with the Exxon Mobil Production Company, said during a conference call. Rumors of Exxon’s entry to the project had been swirling for several days in Alaska. With production from the Prudhoe Bay oil field declining, Alaskans have been hoping for years that natural gas would take over as the state’s financial mainstay. Alaska’s estimated 35 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves are now being reinjected into oil fields or left in the ground because there is no way to get the fuel to consumers. With Exxon and TransCanada on one side, and BP and Conoco on the other, there are two contenders for what would be the biggest civil engineering project in North America, and one of the most challenging. It would dwarf the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline, a momentous project that was completed in 1977. BP and Conoco said their joint pipeline project, called Denali, was going forward. But both said they would be open to alternative plans. Charlie Rowton of ConocoPhillips said, “We do believe the opportunity exists for more collaboration among key stakeholders interested in an Alaska gas pipeline project.” Steve Rinehart, a BP spokesman, said, “BP as a producer and prospective shipper will consider any viable project to deliver gas to market.” TransCanada has estimated that the project would cost $30 billion. It would stretch roughly 1,700 miles from the North Slope of Alaska through Yukon and northeastern British Columbia to the Alberta border near Boundary Lake. From there, it would connect to Alberta’s existing gas infrastructure, which is linked to the United States. The pipe would have a daily capacity of six billion cubic feet of natural gas, or about 10 percent of current domestic consumption. It would begin operations in 2018. Building an Alaska gas pipeline has been sought for decades as a crucial element of the nation’s energy security. But new drilling methods in places like Texas and Oklahoma have unlocked substantially more domestic gas reserves in recent years than most experts ever anticipated. Instead of a facing a potential gas shortage, the nation is looking at the possibility of a surplus. When Governor Palin took office in late 2006, she interrupted the negotiations that her predecessor, Frank H. Murkowski, had been pursuing with the North Slope oil operators, BP, Conoco and Exxon Mobil, to build a pipeline. After saying the talks were too secretive and not competitive, the governor sought to bring in new operators to secure better terms for Alaska. Late last year, Alaska picked TransCanada as its preferred operator after a competition that was shunned by the major companies, including Exxon. Tony Palmer, vice president of Alaska development for TransCanada, said the project would make economic sense as worldwide gas supplies tighten and prices rise, and he welcomed Exxon’s decision to participate. “We think it is an important step forward,” Mr. Palmer said.

Add to Portfolio Berkshire Hathaway Inc ConocoPhillips Inc Go to your Portfolio » The company, based in Omaha, reported a net loss of $1.53 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to a profit of $940 million in the year-earlier quarter. The net loss per class A share was $990 in the quarter, in contrast to earnings of $607 a share in the year-earlier quarter. Mr. Buffett has acknowledged a major mistake in purchasing ConocoPhillips shares when oil and gas prices were near record levels last year. In the first quarter, the company sold 13.7 million of its 79.9 million shares of ConocoPhillips, using the loss to offset past taxes on capital gains. In a letter to shareholders in February, Mr. Buffett said the investment in ConocoPhillips had cost Berkshire several billion dollars. Last year, Berkshire Hathaway became the biggest shareholder in ConocoPhillips. But since last June, its share price has dropped by half, resulting in Berkshire taking a $1.9 billion charge on the oil company’s stock. In the earnings report, Mr. Buffett said he expected the price of ConocoPhillips shares to ultimately exceed the purchase price. The company also took $1.3 billion in write-downs in derivatives tied to corporate-debt indexes. At the company’s annual meeting last Saturday in Omaha, Mr. Buffett said, “I didn’t cover myself in glory” in 2008. Berkshire Hathaway, which owns assets as diverse as insurance operations, Benjamin Moore Paint and See’s Candies, reported that revenue for the quarter fell 9.5 percent, to $22.8 billion, from $25.2 billion a year earlier. It had operating earnings of $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 12 percent from $1.93 billion in the first quarter of last year. Mr. Buffett has urged focusing on operating earnings, saying they were a fairer measure of performance because they exclude the stock price swings of its investments. The company reported increased operating earnings in its insurance underwriting and insurance investment income. But operating earnings in its noninsurance businesses were hit hard by the recession and fell to $539 million in the first quarter, from $950 million in the year-earlier period. At the annual meeting, Mr. Buffett said earnings from insurance underwriting should increase because the recession hardly affects them. Although Mr. Buffett has criticized derivatives, Berkshire’s derivative commitments have pushed down its results over the last year. Its derivatives losses included $675 million of payments related to junk-bond defaults as a result of several corporate bankruptcies. Mr. Buffett has said “the odds are good” that the directive contracts tied to stock markets would be profitable long term, but he was more pessimistic about derivatives linked to corporate debt. Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Berkshire’s triple-A ratings in 2009. Berkshire owns 20.4 percent of Moody’s parent, Moody’s Corporation.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio ConocoPhillips Inc Go to your Portfolio » The upbeat reports, though preliminary, were one of several reasons oil prices continued their slide Tuesday, dropping to $91.42 a barrel, down $4.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the second consecutive day of big retreats that have brought crude down more than $50 below its peak of $145.29 a barrel in July. The collapse in oil prices appears to be stem mainly from a growing perception that the global economy is sliding into a recession. It comes despite escalating rebel attacks on oil operations in Nigeria and two major hurricanes that have shut down 20 percent of the nation’s refining capacity and almost all of the oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. But even as oil prices are sliding, gasoline prices are going up because of tightening supplies. The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose overnight, to $3.85, according to AAA, the automotive club. That was considerably slower than the 16-cent-a-gallon rise in recent days as Ike passed through the Gulf and damage reports began to come in. The oil companies have flown over their oil and gas platforms and begun sending crews to their most important production and refining facilities. The preliminary news is good, with only 28 mostly older and smaller platforms out of a total of 3,800 oil and gas platforms reported destroyed and little flooding or structural damage to more than 20 refineries in and around Hurricane Ike’s path. Gulf oil and gas production trickled back Tuesday, but 97.2 percent of oil production and 84.2 percent of gas production was still off line, according to the Minerals Management Service. “We did better than we thought,” said Chip Johnson, president and chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas. Experts are predicting that half of the 14 refineries in Texas and Louisiana shut down by Ike will be at or near normal operation in a week or so when power supplies are back on line. But other refineries may take longer to restart, and some energy analysts predict that up to 10 percent of the nation’s refining capacity could be off line for several weeks. Some facilities, like Valero’s Port Arthur, Tex., refinery and ConocoPhillips’s Alliance refinery in Belle Chasse, La., have suffered some flooding. Mr. Johnson of Carrizo said the price picture for gasoline over the next month was uncertain. “Demand is going to be down, but so is supply,” he added. Christopher Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, a brokerage and research firm, warned that the gasoline price increase in many regions had so far come mostly in response to Hurricane Gustav two weeks ago, and the shock from Ike might still come in the weeks ahead. He noted that it took about 18 days for oil products to travel from the gulf coast to New Jersey by pipeline, so shortages around the gulf could take time to be reflected in price increases in the Northeast. “It will be another week or so before you get the full impact of Hurricane Ike,” he predicted. The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline is now about 10 cents more than a month ago, and more than a dollar above a year ago. Oil company executives and other energy experts said it could take several more days to assess all damages from the latest hurricane. They note that inspectors still need to go below the rigs and check pipelines for possible damages.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline BP, ConocoPhillips, Shell and Transocean, a large drilling contractor, have begun evacuating hundreds of workers from rigs and production platforms in deep waters of the Gulf. Conoco suspended drilling of some new wells in southern Louisiana and evacuated workers from its Magnolia field, whose daily production had previously been suspended for maintenance. Valero and other refiners have put their workers on alert to prepare for a possible direct hit on operations along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. “We’re planning for a major hurricane in the Gulf, and we are taking appropriate steps,” a ConocoPhillips spokesman, Bill Tanner, said. Chevron and Motiva Enterprises, which supplies Shell-branded gasoline across the Gulf Coast, took steps to ensure that terminals and gasoline stations had additional supplies to anticipate any increased demand in the event of an evacuation of New Orleans or another city. Most companies maintained production levels near normal, but there were signs that they were preparing to shut down a significant number of platforms over the next several days. Shell announced that it was shutting down a few production wells Thursday morning and that it would complete an evacuation of all its 1,300 workers in Gulf waters by Saturday. Anadarko Petroleum announced that it was also beginning a total evacuation of 600 employees and contractors from drilling and production platforms around the Gulf to be completed by Sunday. Forecasts vary widely on how powerful the storm could become and where it will eventually hit the mainland. Overnight, the storm moved south toward Jamaica with 70 mile-an-hour winds, meaning that oil and gas companies may have an extra day or two to prepare. It could regain hurricane strength by the end of the day. Final landfall could come anywhere from South Texas to the Florida panhandle. Crude and natural gas prices had been edging up over the last several days, but prices plummeted on Thursday. Crude oil declined by $2.56, to $115.59 a barrel. Natural gas prices declined 55.8 cents, to $8.05 per million B.T.U.’s. As the Labor Day weekend approached, gasoline prices had not been seriously affected by fears that the storm could disrupt supplies. The average national price for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.66, down 28 cents from a month ago. Energy analysts said oil prices were easing because traders were relieved that the International Energy Agency, the policy adviser to 27 industrialized countries, announced that it would release strategic oil stocks if the storm caused major damage to Gulf facilities. “The announcement eased fears that we will have a supply issue over the next couple of weeks,” said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. The Energy Department said the government was prepared to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the event Gustav disrupted production, as it had after the 2005 hurricanes. “D.O.E. is closely monitoring the situation and stands ready to use every available tool to ensure continuous and reliable supplies of energy,” the department said. The drop in natural gas prices came in response to an Energy Department report of the largest increase in inventories since early July, suggesting that demand for power generation had slackened at a time when domestic production was surging. The region produces about a quarter of domestic oil production and almost 15 percent of natural gas production. Gustav could be the first storm to directly hit a large portion of the region’s energy infrastructure since 2005. That year the hurricanes Katrina and Rita crippled more than a hundred platforms, flooded several refineries and power stations and sent oil and gas prices soaring. Over the last three years, producers and refiners have taken action to better secure their facilities from heavy storms. More anchor lines have been installed on platforms and rigs, and equipment has been raised higher out of the water. Many of the older platforms that were not properly reinforced for storm surges were paralyzed during the 2005 hurricane season and remain out of order. New platforms that have been built since then are considered more storm resistant. The Gulf region is relatively less important for the country’s energy supplies than it was in 2005, because of a natural gas production boom onshore and because production in several Gulf fields is in decline. Consumption of oil is down this year by about 130,000 barrels a day, or 1.5 percent over the six months, according to the Energy Department.

There, on one stage, sat the leaders of BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Total, Schlumberger and Dow Chemical, as well as the chairman of the Russian energy giant Gazprom and the president of the Russian oil company Lukoil. Skip to next paragraph Related Russia Takes Critical Tone on Economy (June 8, 2008) The busy executives of the global energy industry, by their very willingness to sit together at an economic conference here over the weekend, were sending a powerful message that big Western businesses were in Russia to stay. They may be worried about the weak rule of law, corruption and lack of an independent judiciary, as seen in recent troubles confronting BP and Shell with their Russian partners. But that is not likely to stop them from swarming around the honey pot for large contracts and access to the resources of Russia, one of the world’s largest energy exporters and fastest growing economies in an era of $130-a-barrel oil. And while politicians in Western Europe fret over their own inability to develop a cohesive energy policy  and some fan fears of a newly resurgent, aggressive Russia  many of the sharpest minds who gathered here at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum seemed focused on something quite different: ensuring that Russians benefit from economic plenty this time, as opposed to the heady era of privatization in the 1990s, which benefited only a few. In a speech on Sunday that was keenly awaited by liberals in Russia’s business elite, a first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, listed the “many hurdles” on this path: an over-reliance on energy exports, a falling population, a lack of modern skills, an unhealthy way of life and a state apparatus with a tendency to meddle. “Russia should be a country that people want to live in,” Mr. Shuvalov said in remarks that seemed uncharacteristically self-deprecating for a top Russian official these days. Mr. Shuvalov’s audience filled less than half of the hall. It had been packed on Saturday when the new president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, took subtle aim at the United States, suggesting that the world might be in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and that a revived Russia could offer solutions to problems that have underscored America’s shortcomings. But the crowd on Sunday was rapt as Russian and Western business executives peered out to make projections on Russia’s state and standing in 2020. So much has changed, so fast, in the past decade here that there is little clarity on how to proceed. As one Russian participant, Alexander V. Izosimov of the cellphone operator VimpelCom, said, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Jim O’Neill, who is the chief economist of Goldman Sachs  and credited with coining the phrase “BRIC countries” to describe Brazil, Russia, India and China becoming leaders among world economies  surprised the crowd by predicting a conservative overall average of 3.3 percent annual economic growth in Russia by 2020, down from growth around 8 percent now. Russia, Mr. O’Neill said, will have a 4 percent share of world’s gross domestic product then, compared with 2 percent now. But he said it would be weaker relative to Brazil, India and China because of far fewer people at work. India alone is expected to grow by 300 million people  twice Russia’s current population. Michael Klein, chairman and chief executive of the institutional clients group of Citigroup, was more ebullient: “The future will exceed by a big stretch the plans for 2020”  the Russian government’s target date for certain improvements. “Russia is clearly one of the most successful economic stories of the decade,” he said, and possibly “the first scale economy to sustainably avoid the resource curse,” the evils often brought by easy money from commodities like oil and natural gas. Anatoly B. Chubais, a former deputy prime minister despised by many Russians over the inequities of the 1990s privatization program he led, even broached a subject normally taboo: the moribund, regimented state of politics, which has crystallized around the Kremlin and Vladimir V. Putin, the prime minister and previous president (who this weekend left his protégé, Mr. Medvedev, to shine alone in their hometown). “We can’t avoid discussing the political component of the state’s impact on the economy,” Mr. Chubais said in careful language. “The state must be judged from the point of view of quality of services that it provides for the country as a whole. In my understanding, it is impossible to evaluate the quality of this service without real give and take and a truly competitive political mechanism.” Few in today’s Russia  from those surviving on the equivalent of $158 a month to a tiny elite used to the really good life  worry publicly about political freedoms. Many are still simply poor. Some are consumed with consuming; others worry about how to lock in economic gains. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in World »ST.

Big diversified oil companies are reporting enormous profits but they are receiving what seems to be a record amount of grief. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Chevron Corp ConocoPhillips Inc Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » Consumers curse them when they pay close to a hundred bucks to fill up their S.U.V.’s. For politicians at home and abroad, attacking Big Oil is useful for scoring points with the electorate and adding revenue to the treasury. Then there are investors, who have shown little enthusiasm lately for the three American supermajors. Crude oil is up 42 percent since the year began, but the best the supermajors are able to manage is an 8.1 percent gain for Chevron. ConocoPhillips is up 5.5 percent, and the biggest of the big oils, Exxon Mobil, is down 6.6 percent, barely beating the performance of the broad stock market. Shareholders might have expected to do better from three companies that combined to produce net profits of $20 billion in the first quarter alone. Several factors could account for the stocks’ mediocrity: ¶The shares have flattened out only recently after rising sharply for several years. Investors may just be taking money off the table. ¶Crude prices and profits for diversified oil companies do not move in lock step. Margins on refining and selling gasoline and other finished products can fall as crude becomes more expensive. ¶Investors perceive a risk that with oil this expensive, the global economy could tank, sending crude lower and keeping it there. ¶It is hard for big oil companies to increase production significantly, and new sources of supply tend to be in places that are expensive to reach. The high price of crude also drives up the cost of drilling for and transporting oil as service providers demand a bigger slice of an expanding pie. ¶Political hostility  most recently calls for a tax on “windfall” profits  raises concern that companies will benefit less from major discoveries or more efficient operations. “There are some heavy headwinds facing the majors,” said Mark Freeman, a portfolio manager with the Westwood Holdings Group, who has turned neutral on them after being heavily invested in them since 2003. “At this level,” he said, “they are not overly cheap or outrageously overvalued.” Mr. Freeman prefers smaller yet still diversified companies with stronger growth profiles than the supermajors, like Apache, which has interests in natural gas as well as oil, and Occidental Petroleum, which produces oil, gas and chemicals. John Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management, is a contrarian who is drawn to companies and industries that others may shun. He holds a number of energy stocks, from pure plays on the price of crude, like the drillers Transocean and Rowan, to the much safer supermajors. “If you’re concerned about the high price of oil and think we’re in a bubble, the Exxons and Chevrons are going to be low-risk ways to invest, although you’re not going to get rich on them,” he said. TINA VITAL, an oil analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s, finds the supermajors’ shares sufficiently enriching to recommend buying all three, especially ConocoPhillips. She wishes people would give oil executives a break. “Every time crude prices go up, they haul these oil guys in front of Congress,” she said. She also thinks investors should show the stocks more love, too. They do not have the growth profile of a tiny exploration enterprise, Ms. Vital conceded, but she expects the supermajors’ production to pick up soon. She forecasts 2 percent to 3 percent annual growth in the next few years, compared with just 1 percent a year for the industry as a whole. “The supermajors are still a great place to be because they’re starting to bring large projects on line that have been years in the making,” she said. “The supermajors are uniquely positioned to negotiate internationally and take part in technologically advanced projects in deep water and the Arctic, and they benefit from economies of scale. There is value to be had in them.” More Articles in Business »WHO says everyone loves a winner? Big diversified oil companies are reporting enormous profits but they are receiving what seems to be a record amount of grief. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Chevron Corp ConocoPhillips Inc Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » Consumers curse them when they pay close to a hundred bucks to fill up their S.U.V.’s. For politicians at home and abroad, attacking Big Oil is useful for scoring points with the electorate and adding revenue to the treasury. Then there are investors, who have shown little enthusiasm lately for the three American supermajors. Crude oil is up 42 percent since the year began, but the best the supermajors are able to manage is an 8.1 percent gain for Chevron. ConocoPhillips is up 5.5 percent, and the biggest of the big oils, Exxon Mobil, is down 6.6 percent, barely beating the performance of the broad stock market. Shareholders might have expected to do better from three companies that combined to produce net profits of $20 billion in the first quarter alone. Several factors could account for the stocks’ mediocrity: ¶The shares have flattened out only recently after rising sharply for several years. Investors may just be taking money off the table. ¶Crude prices and profits for diversified oil companies do not move in lock step. Margins on refining and selling gasoline and other finished products can fall as crude becomes more expensive. ¶Investors perceive a risk that with oil this expensive, the global economy could tank, sending crude lower and keeping it there. ¶It is hard for big oil companies to increase production significantly, and new sources of supply tend to be in places that are expensive to reach. The high price of crude also drives up the cost of drilling for and transporting oil as service providers demand a bigger slice of an expanding pie. ¶Political hostility  most recently calls for a tax on “windfall” profits  raises concern that companies will benefit less from major discoveries or more efficient operations. “There are some heavy headwinds facing the majors,” said Mark Freeman, a portfolio manager with the Westwood Holdings Group, who has turned neutral on them after being heavily invested in them since 2003. “At this level,” he said, “they are not overly cheap or outrageously overvalued.” Mr. Freeman prefers smaller yet still diversified companies with stronger growth profiles than the supermajors, like Apache, which has interests in natural gas as well as oil, and Occidental Petroleum, which produces oil, gas and chemicals. John Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management, is a contrarian who is drawn to companies and industries that others may shun. He holds a number of energy stocks, from pure plays on the price of crude, like the drillers Transocean and Rowan, to the much safer supermajors. “If you’re concerned about the high price of oil and think we’re in a bubble, the Exxons and Chevrons are going to be low-risk ways to invest, although you’re not going to get rich on them,” he said. TINA VITAL, an oil analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s, finds the supermajors’ shares sufficiently enriching to recommend buying all three, especially ConocoPhillips. She wishes people would give oil executives a break. “Every time crude prices go up, they haul these oil guys in front of Congress,” she said. She also thinks investors should show the stocks more love, too. They do not have the growth profile of a tiny exploration enterprise, Ms. Vital conceded, but she expects the supermajors’ production to pick up soon.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Graphic Carbon Emissions Across the United States Related Times Topics: Global Warming Paul Foy/Associated Press Watchdog groups often single out the Four Corners plant in New Mexico, which burns coal, as an egregious polluter. The discussions have often been tense. Pinned on a wall, a large handmade poster with Rolling Stones lyrics reminds everyone, “You can’t always get what you want.” What unites these two groups  business executives from Duke Energy, the Ford Motor Company and ConocoPhillips, as well as heads of environmental organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council  is a desire to deal with climate change. They have broken with much of corporate America to declare that it is time for the federal government to act and set mandatory limits on emissions. What divides them is that dealing with climate change will almost certainly hurt some industries and enrich others. Billions of dollars are at stake. Depending on how the nation decides to tackle the problem, electricity bills in some states could rise 50 percent, and gasoline prices could go up 50 cents a gallon. “It’s really now a battle over the economics,” said James E. Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, who has long advocated curbing carbon emissions. “The debate is not about the climate problem. Everybody could agree on the principles and still get the economics wrong.” The Senate is to vote Monday to kick off a weeklong discussion on carbon limits. But the intense debates under way already illustrate just how hard it will be for Congress to satisfy conflicting business interests while coming up with a global-warming plan that works. Opposition from corporate interests, including oil, gas and power companies, prompted the Bush administration to opt out of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that called on developed countries to limit their emissions. But the political winds have shifted. All three presidential candidates have said they favor mandatory curbs on emissions, and the Democratic majority in Congress wants a strong climate policy. The Senate debate could help set parameters of future legislation, which many experts expect to see within two years. Congress is considering a complicated approach that would set a limit, or cap, on emissions that would be reduced each year. It would also create emissions permits that large industrial companies, like oil refineries or power plants, would be required to use. By putting a value on carbon dioxide, this cap-and-trade system would provide incentives for companies to reduce emissions. Experts say it could turn into one of the biggest markets in the world, estimated to be worth over $200 billion a year. Thus far, climate policy has been slowly shaped by states like California and Massachusetts, with others following. The resulting patchwork of policies has created uncertainty for companies, some of which have recognized that federal system to limit carbon is ultimately unavoidable. “If they are not at the table, they will not have a hand in the making of the regulation,” said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. That recognition led to the Climate Action Partnership, the Washington group, in which corporate behemoths and environmental groups have been debating climate policy for over two years, sometimes meeting every week, in order to force the issue. In January 2007, the eclectic group endorsed a bold national policy that called for reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 60 percent to 80 percent by 2050, an aggressive target that is in line with recommendations from an international panel of scientists. But the group, which now has 33 members, has failed to reach consensus on a variety of issues, including how to allocate carbon permits and whether to include a price cap for carbon credits. “They helped crystallize the concerns about climate,” said David G. Victor, the director of the energy and sustainable development program at Stanford University and an expert on climate policy who has been closely following the debates. “But the moment the coalition starts to focus on the details, it starts breaking apart. It’s a litmus test for the debate in the country.” The sharpest battle lines have been drawn over the structure of a cap-and-trade system. This mostly centers on whether carbon allocations  or pollution permits, as some see them  should be granted to companies or auctioned off. Under one proposal, Congress would give away about half the allowances to businesses like power plants and oil companies, but also to states and farmers, in order to give time for them to adapt to lower-carbon technologies. Over time, it would gradually sell the rest to the highest bidder, raising money for developing alternative energy sources. The bill, sponsored by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent, and John W. Warner, a Republican, passed a crucial vote in a committee last December and will be debated on the Senate floor this week. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Some of the most powerful corporate leaders in America have been meeting regularly with leading environmental groups in a conference room in downtown Washington for over two years to work on proposals for a national policy to limit carbon emissions.

The terms of the settlement were submitted for approval in the federal court for the Southern District of New York. Under the terms of the deal, the companies also agreed to pay 70 percent of the future cleanup costs over the next 30 years. The defendants that agreed to the settlement include BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Marathon Oil, Valero Energy, Citgo and Sunoco. Six other companies named in the lawsuit, including Exxon Mobil, did not agree to the deal, said Scott Summy, a lawyer at Baron &amp; Budd and a counsel for the plaintiffs. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, which include 153 public water systems in New York, California and 15 other states, claimed that the additive, a chemical called methyl tertiary butyl ether, or M.T.B.E., was a defective product that led to widespread contamination of groundwater. The suit contended that the chemical was used by oil companies, even though they knew of the environmental and health risks that it posed. Low levels of M.T.B.E. can make drinking water supplies unpalatable because of its ''offensive taste and odor,'' according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has also found that the compound caused cancer in laboratory rats that were exposed to high doses. Since the mid-1990s, hundreds of lawsuits have been brought against oil companies for their use of the chemical. This deal, if approved, would be the largest settlement to date. M.T.B.E. has been used since 1979 to increase octane levels in gasoline, but its use became more widespread after the 1990 Clean Air Act mandated the use of an oxygenate in certain cities to reduce smog and other pollutants. When mixed with gasoline, the additive ensured that the fuel burned more thoroughly, thereby reducing air pollution. But after being widely adopted, it was found to corrupt groundwater. Even in small amounts, the additive makes water smell and taste like turpentine. The use of M.T.B.E. is now banned in 23 states, including New York and California. In 2005, some 130,000 barrels of M.T.B.E. were produced a day, representing about 1 percent of the nation's gasoline supplies. Oil companies stopped using it in 2006. The oil industry has fought hard to avoid penalties related to its use of the additive, arguing that it should not be forced to pay for the cleanup of a product that it was mandated to use. Estimates of the cost of a total cleanup of M.T.B.E. have run to the tens of billions of dollars. In 2003, the Republican-dominated Congress tried to pass a provision that would have shielded M.T.B.E. manufacturers from litigation, but failed because of strong opposition in the Senate. A second attempt to add a lawsuit shield also failed during discussion of the 2005 energy bill. ''No court has ruled that gasoline with M.T.B.E. is a defective product,'' said Rick Wallace, a lawyer at Wallace King Domike &amp; Reiskin in Washington, who represents Chevron and Shell. ''This settlement does not concede the point. Quite the contrary, the settling companies are prepared to vigorously defend the product.'' The high risk of lawsuits related to M.T.B.E. has prompted the oil industry to stop using it and look for another gasoline additive. That eventually led to the development and use of ethanol as an oxygenate replacement. Peter J. Sacripanti, a lawyer representing Exxon at McDermott Will &amp; Emery, said that Exxon did not plan to settle and would ''vigorously defend'' itself. ''Exxon's position is very simple,'' he said. ''When it engages in conduct that injures people, it pays recompense for that. In all these cases, our conduct did not cause injury, or cause damages. Our conduct was lawful.'' The suit, first filed in 2003 by public water providers in several states, was eventually consolidated into a single federal case. The pending case will go to trial in September in New York. Robert J. Gordon, of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg in New York, also represented the plaintiffs.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/25/business/25oil.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Conoco Gains on Oil Prices, Not So Much on Gasoline<date>Published: April 25, 2008</date><text>ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that its first-quarter earnings rose 17 percent as soaring oil and natural gas prices outweighed weak profits from gasoline production. Oil prices have increased nearly sixfold since 2002 on surging demand from emerging economies, supply concerns and the weak dollar. Net income in the quarter rose to $4.14 billion, or $2.62 a share, from $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue in the quarter rose 33 percent, to $54.88 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned about $2.56 a share. Analysts, on average, had expected it to bring in about $2.41 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gene Pisasale, who helps manage $12 billion at PNC Capital Advisors, said the company’s exploration and production results were a “blowout,” and made up the difference between the reported results and analyst estimates. Benchmark oil prices in the United States averaged a record of nearly $98 a barrel during the quarter, up almost 70 percent from a year earlier. But margins to produce gasoline have plummeted as refiners have struggled to push through the higher crude costs to customers.

ConocoPhillips said earnings from its refining and marketing business fell nearly 55 percent, to $520 million. Net income from the company’s 20 percent stake in the Russian oil company Lukoil stake nearly tripled, to $710 million. Oil and gas production, excluding the Lukoil stake, was down more than 11 percent, to 1.79 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, mostly because of the loss of projects that were taken over by the Venezuelan government.

They said they would spend billions to build a pipeline from the North Slope to feed energy-hungry markets in the United States and Canada. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Al Grillo/Associated Press James L. Bowles, left, Conoco Alaskas president, and Doug Suttles, BP Alaskas president, announced plans Tuesday to develop jointly a pipeline to move natural gas from the North Slope. The proposal won praise from Alaska’s governor, Sarah Palin. “It’s a good day,” she told reporters in Alaska. The announcement comes at a time when consumption of natural gas in the United States is increasing and conventional production is declining. Natural gas is cleaner than other power sources, like coal, and analysts say it is becoming increasingly critical to the nation’s energy needs. BP and Conoco will initially spend $600 million in the next three years to drum up support for the project, seek state and federal approval, and secure gas supplies for the pipeline. BP and Conoco said the project would be the largest-ever private sector construction project in North America. The project, which would include a $5 billion gas-processing facility on the North Slope, would cost about $30 billion and take at least 10 years to complete. At a time when both energy prices and construction costs are soaring, the endeavor would dwarf the 800 mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline, a momentous project completed in 1977 and that brought jobs and revenue to Alaska. As oil production from the Prudhoe Bay field declines, Alaskans are hoping that natural gas will take over from oil. An Alaska gas pipeline has long been sought as a critical component of the nation’s energy security. The planned pipeline would have a daily capacity of 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or almost 7 percent of current United States consumption. But the companies will have to overcome some huge hurdles, said Christopher Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, a brokerage and research firm. “We’ve had a long record of Alaska pipeline projects coming out of Alaska and Canada, and they have consistently been delayed because of political opposition and rising costs,” he said. “The United States and Canada desperately need the gas. But the question is, is it doable?” The companies will need to secure more than 1,000 permits from local, state and federal authorities in both the United States and Canada, a process that will most likely take years. They need to negotiate with native tribes along the pipeline’s route to secure the right of way. If the oil pipeline is any guide, the gas line will also require vast engineering feats. But with higher prices, and a growing appetite for natural gas, the economics of such a large project are starting to make sense for oil companies. The companies said the initial plan is to build a 2,000-mile pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope to the Canadian province of Alberta; that would add to the total North American gas supply, freeing some Canadian gas for export to the United States. Eventually, the pipeline might be extended 1,500 miles, to Chicago. “This will be a massive undertaking,” said Doug Suttles, president of BP Alaska. “It is going to take the big team to get this going.” The plan to build a natural gas pipeline to export the state’s vast gas resources has been tangled in Alaskan politics for years. Today, Alaska’s estimated 35 trillion feet of gas reserves are either re-injected into oil fields or left dormant because of a lack of export facilities to bring them to consumers. When Governor Palin took office in late 2006, she interrupted pipeline negotiations that her predecessor, Frank H. Murkowski, had been pursuing with the North Slope oil operators, BP, Conoco and Exxon Mobil. She started from scratch after criticizing the previous talks as not being competitive enough, and sought to bring in new operators in order to secure better terms for Alaska. Her administration is evaluating a proposal made by a Canadian pipeline operator, TransCanada. But the oil companies complained about the delays and said the governor’s procedure was unrealistic. Eschewing $500 million in potential subsidies from the state, BP and ConocoPhillips declared on Tuesday that the economics of natural gas have reached the point that they can finance the pipeline on their own. James L. Bowles, the president of Conoco Alaska, said that while the companies would seek no state subsidies, they will try to meet requirements outlined by Alaskan authorities, like offering local delivery points on the pipeline to meet the state’s natural gas requirements. “This project is moving forward on its own,” he said. Ms. Palin welcomed BP’s and Conoco’s proposal, while stopping short of formally endorsing it. She told reporters that she would meet with executives from the companies to find out more about the joint project. Still, she added, “it sounds great for the state of Alaska.” The plan came as a surprise to Exxon, which said it had been invited to participate only a few days ago. The company will now “evaluate all options,” according to Margaret Ross, an Exxon spokeswoman. BP and Conoco said they would welcome Exxon’s participation. Many analysts have voiced concerns that natural gas prices would keep rising as domestic demand grows and Canada’s exports fall because of increased consumption there. Without a natural gas pipeline, the United States will increasingly depend on imports of natural gas in liquefied form, a source that is costly and potentially vulnerable to political instability in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Greater demand is already pushing prices higher, and adding to pressure to open deeper waters off the country’s coast for exploration. Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy analyst at Rice University, said a gas pipeline was badly needed, in addition to the liquefied natural gas projects under consideration. “In the long term it’s not going to mean we are not going to need L.N.G., but we would need a lot more L.N.G. if Alaska does not happen,” she said. Natural gas consumption rose by 6.2 percent in 2007, to 23 trillion cubic feet, from 21.7 trillion cubic feet in 2006, according to the Energy Information Administration. Natural gas prices, which averaged $2 a thousand cubic feet in the 1990s, have soared in the last decade. It recently traded at $9.74 a thousand cubic feet on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Without a natural gas pipeline, the United States will increasingly depend on imports of natural gas in liquefied form, a source that is costly and potentially vulnerable to political instability in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Greater demand is already pushing prices higher, and adding to pressure to open deeper waters off the country’s coast for exploration. Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy analyst at Rice University, said a gas pipeline was badly needed, in addition to the liquefied natural gas projects under consideration. “In the long term it’s not going to mean we are not going to need L.N.G., but we would need a lot more L.N.G. if Alaska does not happen,” she said. Natural gas consumption rose by 6.2 percent in 2007, to 23 trillion cubic feet, from 21.7 trillion cubic feet in 2006, according to the Energy Information Administration. Natural gas prices, which averaged $2 a thousand cubic feet in the 1990s, have soared in the last decade. It recently traded at $9.74 a thousand cubic feet on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/business/07oil.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Shell Is High Bidder to Drill for Oil and Gas Off Alaska<date>Published: February 7, 2008</date><text>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP)  Royal Dutch Shell led a handful of petroleum companies in bidding Wednesday for leases in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska’s northwest shore. The sale went forward over the protest of conservation and Native Alaska groups, plus objections by Congressional members outside the state, who said the federal agency, the Minerals Management Service, should have delayed the sale until a decision was made on protections for polar bears. Shell’s vice president for exploration for the Americas, Annell Bay, said the lease sale was an opportunity to move into an undeveloped region that could help meet an increasing demand for energy. “There’s not many areas like this in the United States,” Ms. Bay said. Seven companies offered bids totaling nearly $3.4 billion. High bids added up to nearly $2.7 billion on 2.76 million acres. The federal agency estimates the area contains 15 billion barrels of conventionally recoverable oil and 77 trillion cubic feet of conventionally recoverable natural gas. Shell, bidding as Shelf Gulf of Mexico, submitted 275 high bids, adding up to $2.1 billion. Shell bid $105 million for one tract, which worked out to be $18,497 a acre. A second company, ConocoPhillips, submitted 98 high bids adding up to $506 million and competed with Shell for dozens of others. ConocoPhillips was unsuccessful on 47 tracts for which it bid $593.6 million. Shell was unsuccessful on 27 tracts for which it had bid another $82 million. Other bidders included Repsol E&amp;P USA, with 93 high bids that added up to $14.4 million; Eni Petroleum US, with 17 bids for $8.9 million; and Statoil Hydro USA E&amp;P, with 16 for $14.4 million. The federal agency will take about 90 days to review bids. It can reject bids that do not meet fair market value. The sale, covering an area slightly smaller than Pennsylvania, was in marine habitat used by one of two of Alaska’s polar bear populations. Protesters braved temperatures of 13 degrees below zero, holding signs that read, “Chill the Drills,” “Don’t spoil my dinner” and “I prefer whale oil.” Under the sale, the agency envisioned moving the oil by a pipeline built from Northwest Alaska to the trans-Alaska pipeline, which moves North Slope oil to tankers in Valdez. “My worst fear is that they have an oil spill,” said George Kingik, the former mayor of Point Hope, an Inupiat Eskimo community southwest of Barrow. Conservation groups say development of offshore oil fields will add stress to a rapidly changing environment hammered by global warming and record summer ice loss. “It’s irresponsible to move ahead with the lease sale in light of global warming and its immediate effect on the Arctic,” said Trish Rolfe, Alaska region representative of the Sierra Club.

But an abrogation of the contract seemed unlikely given that as recently as last month the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, said his government would not cancel the deal. Still, the market reaction to an unconfirmed report by Russia’s Interfax news agency was an indication of the importance of the Kashagan deal to Eni and its partners, which include Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total of France and Inpex Holdings of Japan.

The field is the largest new oil find since the discovery of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in the 1970s, but it is technically complex to develop.

Skip to next paragraph Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters Prime Minister Karim K. Masimov wants renegotiated terms with oil companies developing the Kashagan field. The suspension came as Kazakh officials and the consortium, led by the Italian oil company Eni, were negotiating new terms for a $20 billion development contract for the Kashagan field, arousing speculation that the move was an effort to press the companies into ceding a larger share of future profits to the Kazakh government. The stakes are high because of the fields vast reserves. The Kashagan field is a centerpiece of Western and Japanese efforts to diversify oil supplies away from the Middle East to other regions like the Caspian Sea basin. The suspension of the environmental permits, announced Monday, was not considered to be a significant threat to the project in the long term. Speaking Monday after a ministerial meeting in Astana, the Kazakh capital, the environment minister, Nurlan Iskakov, said operations would be suspended at the field for three months. The environmental protection requirements are not being observed today, he said. Yet a deputy minister, Zeinulla S. Sarsembayev, said in a telephone interview that the consortium could continue drilling during the suspension period if it paid fines to do so. The company itself will decide, he said. We have given this right to the company. He did not specify the amount of the fines. Still, the suspension of environmental permits seemed to raise the stakes in a dispute that began this month when Eni announced cost overruns and a delay in bringing the Kashagan field online. Kazakhstans prime minister, Karim K.

Kazakh officials announced `that they would suspend the permits on the same day that Eni executives opened talks with the government on their disagreement over cost overruns and delays.

And the finance ministry said it had opened a criminal investigation into a contractor, Agip, an Eni unit, on suspicion of violating customs rules while importing two helicopters. President Nursultan Nazarbayev fired the energy minister who had overseen the project. The regulatory barrage recalled methods used by the Russian government against Shell in the Sakhalin II project last autumn. After a lengthy campaign charging environmental damage, Shell eventually agreed to cede control to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned energy company. Eni released a subdued statement Monday saying only that it had "received a letter in the last few days with an offer for friendly rediscussion of the contract." Kazakhstan, the largest country in formerly Soviet Central Asia, now produces roughly a million barrels of oil a day, or about a tenth of the output of Saudi Arabia. It is expected to triple production within 10 years as the Kashagan field and other projects come online. The field lies under shallow water in the northeastern corner of the Caspian Sea and is technically complex. The companies drilling in winter includes breaking through ice floes and habitat for marine life, including sturgeon, the source of black caviar.

The company said it was also hurt by lower sales and higher taxes in the most-recent quarter, factors partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Daily production for the quarter averaged 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, down from 2.1 million barrels a day a year earlier. The company attributed the decrease to normal field declines, planned maintenance in the North Sea and its exit from Dubai, among other factors.

More Articles in Business »HOUSTON, July 25 (AP)  ConocoPhillips said Wednesday that its second-quarter profit fell 94 percent as it incurred a $4.5 billion charge related to its assets in Venezuela, where it has abandoned its heavy oil projects. But its adjusted earnings topped Wall Street expectations and its shares rose 2 percent. Conoco earned $301 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $5.19 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $47.4 billion from $47.1 billion.

United Technologies is a case in point. Fully 60 percent of its total sales are either made in the U.S.A. and exported, or made and sold offshore. It exports Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and Sikorsky helicopters, mostly from Connecticut. And its Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioning subsidiaries have carved out leading positions in emerging markets like China, where the two divisions assemble most of their products. Aided by declines in the dollar, those foreign sales are bolstering the parent company's bottom line, which grew 18 percent last year. The price of its stock, one of the 30 in the Dow Jones industrials, reached a record high on Friday of $72.88. ''There's a lot of tension and drum-banging over job losses,'' says James E. Geisler, vice president for finance at United Technologies, which is based in Hartford but has become a global company. In 2006, only 72,500 of the company's 215,000 employees were in the United States. The remainder are based abroad. ''The fact is, companies that are growing are better employers and some of those employees are in the United States,'' Mr. Geisler said. The United Technologies story is part of a broad structural shift in how and where many American companies are making their money. The trend has been in the making for decades, and by now it clearly carries major economic implications, as well as significant investment opportunities. The trend accentuates the divide between workers who benefit from globalization and those who don't, sometimes within the same company. Financial analysts at United Technologies in Hartford overseeing Carrier's sales in India and Pratt engineers designing jet engines in Connecticut for export to Europe certainly benefit; but people who worked in Syracuse in the company's air-conditioning plant, now defunct, do not. Another divide that seems to be widening is between those Americans whose investments capture international growth opportunities and those whose portfolios don't. In short, the economic divisions created by globalization are becoming ever sharper. On the financial side, increasing globalization of American corporate profits may mean, for example, that United States stock markets can retain their lofty elevations even if domestic growth continues to prove tepid -- because leading companies are earning so much abroad. Companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index that break out their international earnings reported at the end of 2006 that they racked up 45.2 percent of their sales through offshore sales and exports. That is up from 32.2 percent in 2001. ''The long-term trend is for more international,'' says Alec Young, chief international equity strategist at S.&amp; P. Many top multinationals have crossed the 50 percent threshold, as General Electric says it will do this year. Part of the explanation for the rising percentages is that the world is where the growth is. ''In Japan, we're seeing some of the strongest economic growth since World War II,'' Mr. Young said. ''And we're seeing upside growth surprises in Europe.'' Emerging markets from India to Brazil also are enjoying big economic gains. ''Real consumerism is breaking out'' in those markets, Mr. Young said. The charge offshore seems certain to continue because chief executives want to invest where they expect growth to occur. The 10 companies with the largest foreign sales in 2006 were some of the biggest names in American business: Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, General Motors, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, the Altria Group, ConocoPhillips, I.B.M., the American International Group and Procter &amp; Gamble, according to S.&amp; P. Those figures include only the sales of their offshore subsidiaries, not goods or services exported from the United States. ''Corporate profit growth is going to do better than it would have done if these companies had ignored the opportunities elsewhere,'' says Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight, an economic consulting group in Lexington, Mass.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E0D8153EF937A35754C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=conocophillipsinc">WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING; Russia: Chief Executive Raises Stake In Lukoil<date>Published: July 4, 2007</date><text>Lukoil's chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, below, bought 18.35 million shares in the company for $1.4 billion.

Skip to next paragraph James J. Mulva With large investments in Venezuela, Russia and around Asia and the Middle East, ConocoPhillips should have a broad pipeline of projects coming to fruition in the next few years to make it an even more important global player. But the opportunities bring risks in unstable areas like Venezuela, where the company is poised to pull out and take a $4.5 billion write-off. The risks could affect not only profit but also the amount of energy companies like ConocoPhillips can deliver to drivers. Mr. Mulva, 61, spoke recently about his concerns that Congress and the country in general were not doing enough to meet the publics energy needs. He said action was needed from the government, the oil industry and consumers to protect the environment and energy security. Following are excerpts: Q. You have announced support for a national mandatory framework to address greenhouse gas emissions. Is this a new day for ConocoPhillips and the oil industry or is this simply green marketing? A. Its not a new day nor green marketing for ConocoPhillips or the industry. There is a recognition of the science that is becoming quite compelling. Climate is changing. We are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions, and as a company and as an industry we need to participate in the development of a national policy and framework to address climate change. Q. According to the Department of Energy, the United States will consume 28 percent more oil and 19 percent more natural gas in 2030 than it did in 2005. Where will we find all that oil and gas? A. I question whether the supply will be developed to meet those demand expectations. I believe demand is going to be constrained by supply. Q. Drivers are concerned about rising gas prices. What can American drivers expect to pay at the pump in the short term, medium term and long term? A. I would like to see gasoline prices decline. However, I believe that is somewhat unrealistic. Energy costs are going to continue to escalate as a result of the cost it takes to add new resources of energy. Q. What would you like to see in the new federal energy legislation that Congress is working on and what would you not like to see? A. The legislation that is under consideration does nothing to add supply or encourage investment or encourage conservation or efficient use of energy. Effectively, what we are doing, in a somewhat punitive way, is adding taxation with the unrealistic expectation that we can increase the fiscal take, lower the price of energy and encourage investment to add supply. I would encourage more access to the oil and gas companies, to a substantial amount of acreage onshore and offshore that is not available for drilling. Second, we have no real incentives, and in any case, there is difficulty in achieving permits to make infrastructure investment to add pipelines, transportation, terminals and refining capacity. Third, we need to encourage conservation and increase efficiency in the use of energy. Fourth, we should encourage and allocate far more resources, both as a government and as an industry, to do research to improve our technology to have a more efficient development and use of energy in our country. Q. You have a noncontrolling stake in Lukoil at a time when Russia has not been the most friendly country to the United States and market reforms there have been uneven. How are your operations going in Russia? A. Its unfortunate that the economic development and particularly energy development between Russia and the United States have not developed more quickly. Because its logical that Russia, with a great deal of natural resources, and a North American market that needs energy, that we should be working more closely to develop energy investment. For ConocoPhillips, our investment with Lukoil  as a 20 percent owner of Lukoil  has been a very good experience. Everything that Lukoil has indicated that they would do, as well as the Russian government, when we made the investment, has come to pass exactly as they have indicated. We look for the opportunities to invest more with Lukoil and Russian companies inside and outside of Russia, both upstream and downstream.

The possible rupture with the two companies was viewed by oil analysts as a sign that President Hugo Chávez was pressing ahead with efforts to assert greater authority over some of the most coveted oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere. It came after months of negotiations in which several of the worlds largest private oil companies tried to salvage some kind of minority ownership role in Venezuela, one of the largest sources of oil for the United States. The possible exit of two major American oil companies from Venezuela may not have an immediate impact on American energy supplies, but any increase in oil prices that does result will only help Mr. Chávez finance his broadening government social policies. A possible vacuum in expertise could eventually be filled by Chinese, Iranian or other state oil companies. In any case, most energy experts believe that the Venezuelan state oil company will be hard pressed to sustain production levels without American expertise. Rafael Ramírez, the Venezuelan energy minister, made the announcement in Caracas. He concluded that the companies had not met the governments deadline to agree to terms under which the government oil company would take majority control over Conocos investments of about $3.5 billion and Exxons investments, valued at $800 million. Venezuelan officials said that some foreign companies, including Chevron, BP, Total and Statoil, had agreed to cede controlling stakes in their oil ventures to Petróleos de Venezuela, the countrys government-owned energy concern. The projects included in the talks are in the Orinoco Belt, an area south of Caracas that is one of the most valued deposits of heavy oil. The partners who signed are betting on a secure future in our fatherland, Mr. Ramírez told reporters. Still, these companies acceptance of the new rules in Venezuela and the potential exit of Conoco and Exxon point to concern that developments in Venezuela may influence negotiations over oil and natural gas projects in other countries, from rising African oil producers like Angola to longtime members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries like Iran. What happens in Venezuela is something the Russians will look at, and may have bearing on places like Iran, Nigeria and other countries, said Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil analyst at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy of Rice University. Oil is at the heart of a broader nationalization push that also includes large telecommunications and electricity companies. Mr. Chávez is trying to give his government a stronger hand in Venezuelas economy even as the oil industry, by far the countrys largest source of revenue, struggles to maintain anemic production levels. Michael J. Economides, an oil consultant in Houston, said Venezuela could benefit in the short term if fears over production translate into higher global oil prices. If he produces 1 percent less, Mr. Economides said in reference to Mr. Chávez, the world market responds to that and he gets 20 percent more revenue over a period of time. Industry analysts put Venezuelas output at about 2.3 million barrels a days, including more than 400,000 barrels a day from the heavy oil projects. Venezuelas government says overall production is closer to 3.2 million barrels a day. But with public spending surging under Mr. Chávez and with oil companies from Brazil, China and India hesitant to make major investments in Venezuela while legal uncertainty persists, energy analysts have cautioned that Venezuelas government risks allowing prized reserves to remain underdeveloped. The Venezuelans have increased the cost of developing this resource, said Roger Tissot, director for Latin America at PFC Energy, a consulting firm, in Washington. At the end of the day, the Venezuelan people will pay the price for these decisions. Michael S. Goldberg, head of the international dispute resolution group at Baker Botts, a law firm here that represents major oil companies internationally, said he did not think Tuesdays actions were necessarily the end of the story. He added, The prospects of a deal are never over until a sale is made or an arbitrator reaches a decision. The investments at stake are large by any measure, with values ranging from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion for Conoco if Venezuela takes ownership of its heavy oil projects. Exxon stands to lose about $800 million. More than $6 billion may be lost by other private companies, depending on how they are compensated. Although the company is hopeful that the negotiations will be successful, it has preserved all legal rights, including international arbitration, Conoco said. Exxon also expressed hope that an agreement could be reached that would permit it to continue operating in an ownership role. Exxon Mobil is disappointed that we have been unable to reach an agreement on the terms for migration to a mixed enterprise structure, the company said. However, we continue discussions with the Venezuelan government on a way forward. Should the American companies leave, some of the other multinational companies that remain could eventually take their place. The Venezuelan government has been talking to government-controlled companies from China and other countries about creating new ventures to extract and refine Venezuelan oil. Venezuela is now free to find other partners, said Mazhar al-Shereidah, a petroleum economist in Caracas. I dont think Petróleos de Venezuela can cover all the technical and financial demands of these ventures, but this doesnt constitute a dramatic situation. Conocos shares fell 2.9 percent on Tuesday to $75.80 as investors reacted to the announcements from Caracas. Exxon, which relies less on Venezuela as a portion of its overall output, fell 0.7 percent to $81.82.

The earnings results fell 3 cents short of the analysts forecast because it typically does not include one-time gains or expenses. Shares rose $1.18, to $70.82. In a conference call, the companys chairman and chief executive, James J. Mulva, said the company would buy back $1 billion worth of its stock this quarter, and could increase the size of its quarterly buybacks later in the year. The company repurchased $1 billion in shares in the first quarter. Lower year-over-year oil prices hurt results at the companys exploration and production arm, where income fell to $2.33 billion, from $2.55 billion in 2006. The market price of oil was off more than $5 a barrel in the first quarter versus a year ago, and the company also cited higher operating costs and taxes as hindrances. The market price for natural gas was also down from a year ago. Daily production for the quarter averaged the equivalent of 2.02 million barrels of oil a day, a big rise from the 1.61 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2006. The company said that was a result in part of the addition of assets from its $35.6 billion purchase of Burlington Resources, completed last spring. Production results include ConocoPhillipss Canadian Syncrude oil sands operations but not its Russian Lukoil business. More Articles in Business »ConocoPhillips said yesterday that its first-quarter profit rose 7.7 percent as income from asset sales helped offset lower commodity prices and higher operating costs. Net income rose to $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, for the January-to-March period, from $3.29 billion, or $2.34 a share, a year ago.

Skip to next paragraph Related The Energy Challenge: A Renewed Push for Ethanol, Without the Corn (April 17, 2007) The two companies announced Monday that they were forming an alliance to produce and market diesel fuel made from pork, poultry and beef fat. It was another sign that farmers and agribusinesses, which are now producing corn for ethanol, will be playing an increasingly large part in the countrys energy future. The new brew should be available at the neighborhood filling station by the end of the year. The companies said that the diesel, which will be shipped and distributed through existing pipelines from ConocoPhillips refineries, would burn cleaner than conventional diesel. Much of the feedstock for the fuel will come from several Tyson rendering plants. This strategic alliance is a big win for the entire agricultural sector because it paves the way for great participation of fats and oils in renewable fuels, said Richard L. Bond, Tysons president and chief executive. ConocoPhillips, the third-largest American oil company, began producing some diesel from soybean oil last year at a plant in Cork, Ireland. The processing technology for the fat-based diesel was developed and successfully tested at the Irish plant. The oil companys alliance with Tyson indicates an even greater interest in pursuing biofuels; several other companies including Chevron and BP have expressed similar interests recently. Efforts to reprocess animal fat will begin at some Tyson plants by the end of the year, and production is expected to reach 175 million gallons a year by 2009. That represents about 3 percent of the diesel produced by ConocoPhillips in the United States. A total of 250 million gallons of biodiesel was produced in the United States last year, a minuscule percentage of the total American diesel market. But biodiesel production is expected to grow to 1.2 billion gallons a year in about a decade. ConocoPhillips disclosed it was spending up to $100 million on the project. Tyson indicated it would invest a smaller sum. ConocoPhillips believes the key to a secure energy future is the development and efficient use of diverse energy sources, said James J. Mulva, the chairman and chief executive. Mr. Mulva added that the program would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists have linked to global warming. At a news conference here, Mr. Mulva said the new source of biodiesel, though relatively small, would help the country meet its energy needs. In a tight market every incremental increase helps improve supply availability and reduces retail price pressure, he said. BP has been working with DuPont for several years to make new biofuels, including biobutanol, a substance that has similar uses to ethanol but can possibly be shipped by pipeline. It is made from sugar beet stocks. Chevron formed a strategic research alliance last year with the Georgia Institute of Technology to make cellulosic biofuels out of wood or switchgrass. It also invested in a biodiesel plant in Galveston, Tex., which uses soybean oil as a feedstock. The plant will have the potential to produce 100 million gallons a year.

Moving beyond empty threats to cut off all oil exports to the United States, officials have recently stepped up the pressure on the oil companies operating here, warning that they might sell American refineries designed to process Venezuelan crude oil even as they seek new outlets in China and elsewhere around the world. Chávez is playing a game of chicken with the largest oil companies in the world, said Pietro Pitts, an oil analyst who publishes LatinPetroleum, an industry magazine based here. And for the moment he is winning. But this confrontation could easily end up with everyone losing. The biggest energy companies could be squeezed out of the most promising oil patch in the Western Hemisphere. But Venezuela risks undermining the engine behind Mr. Chávezs socialist-inspired revolution by hampering its ability to transform the nations newly valuable heavy oil into riches for years to come. As Mr. Chávez asserts much greater control over Venezuelas oil industry, his national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, is already showing signs of stress. Management has become increasingly politicized and funds for maintenance and development are being diverted to pay for a surge in public spending. Over the last several decades, control of global oil reserves has steadily passed from private companies to national oil companies like Petróleos de Venezuela. According to a new Rice University study, 77 percent of the worlds 1.148 trillion barrels of proven reserves are in the hands of the national companies; 14 of the top 20 oil-producing companies are state-controlled. The implications are potentially stark for the United States, which imports 60 percent of its oil. State companies tend to be far less efficient and innovative, and far more politicized. No place captures the shift in power to nationalist governments like Venezuela. We are on a collision course with Chávez over oil, said Michael J. Economides, a Houston oil consultant who wrote an influential essay comparing Mr. Chávezs populist appeal in Latin America with the pan-Arabism of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya two decades ago. Chávez poses a much bigger threat to Americas energy security than Saddam Hussein ever did. Consider the quandary facing Exxon Mobil, after its chairman, Rex W. Tillerson, recently suggested that Exxon might be forced to abandon a major Venezuelan oil project because of its growing troubles with Mr. Chavez. The energy world took notice. So did Mr. Chávezs government. Only a day later, Venezuelan agents raided Exxons offices here in the San Ignacio towers, a bastion for this countrys business elite. The government said the raid was part of a tax investigation, but energy analysts said the exchange of threat and counterthreat was all too clear. Politics and ideology are driving the confrontation here as Mr. Chávez seeks to limit American influence around the world, starting in Venezuelas oil fields. Mr. Chávez views the Bush administration as a threat, in part because it indirectly supported a coup that briefly removed him from power five years ago. Yet the United States remains Venezuelas largest customer. Mr. Chávez recently decreed that Venezuela would take control of heavy oil fields in the Orinoco Belt, a region southeast of Caracas that has so much potential some experts say it could give the country more reserves than Saudi Arabia. The United States Geological Survey describes the area as the largest single hydrocarbon accumulation in the world, making it highly coveted despite Mr. Chávezs erratic policies. By setting a May 1 deadline for what some foreign oil executives consider an expropriation, the Venezuelan leader risks losing Exxon, ConocoPhillips and other companies, which are loath to put their employees and billions of dollars in assets under Venezuelan management. A departure of expertise and investment could weaken an oil industry already roiling from being transformed into Mr. Chávezs most crucial tool for carrying out his reconfiguration of Venezuelan society. Mr. Chávez has raised taxes on foreign oil companies and forced other oil ventures to come under his governments control. And he has purged more than 17,000 employees from Petróleos de Venezuela after a debilitating strike about four years ago. The talks have bogged down over how much the oil companies stakes in four big Orinoco projects are worth, whether Venezuelas cash-short oil company would pay for the assets in oil instead of cash and, most important, who would manage the reduced operations of the foreign oil companies. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »CARACAS, Venezuela, April 9  With President Hugo Chávez setting a May 1 deadline for an ambitious plan to wrest control of several key oil projects from American and European companies, a showdown is looming here over access to some of the most coveted energy resources outside the Middle East.

Sarah Palin has been full of firsts. Ms. Palin, a Republican, is Alaskas first female governor and, at 42, its youngest. She held her inauguration in frosty Fairbanks, a first that suited her conservative supporters but slighted the traditional host, this rainy, remote and less Republican state capital. She also appears to be the only governor in history whose spouse is a champion snowmobile racer and a former Arctic oil worker, and is widely referred to as First Dude. Now, two months after taking office, Ms. Palin wants to become the first Alaska governor to deliver what many others have sought without success: construction of a $30 billion pipeline to transport natural gas from the states North Slope to markets in the lower 48 states. It is an enormous project that could strengthen Alaskas energy-based economy for decades to come, while also, according to some estimates, supplying 7 percent of the nations natural gas annually. But pulling off this first is shaping up to be more complicated. Elected by a wide margin after promising to bring new energy and transparency to the pipeline project, Ms. Palin took office in December and immediately backed away from the negotiations that her predecessor, Frank H. Murkowski, had been pursuing with the three major energy companies that control much of the land where gas would be developed. Ms. Palin has long criticized those negotiations as back-room dealings whose extensive incentives and tax breaks would have benefited the energy companies, BP, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, far more than they would have Alaska. Dont get me started, she said in an interview in her Capitol office on Thursday. So next month, Ms. Palin intends to introduce the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, a bill that would open the bidding to new players, as well as the old ones. She says her plan would ensure new jobs and access to gas for state residents. She also says that whoever gets to control the pipeline must allow for its potential expansion so that other gas developers can use it at reasonable prices, thus encouraging more development. The new plan, however, would delay a formal agreement until next year at the earliest, and it would be another decade, until 2018, before the pipeline was in operation. Ms. Palin won votes last fall for vowing to take just such steps, but in taking them, she has stirred concern beyond Alaska at a time when the Bush administration says it wants to develop new sources of energy. In a report to Congress last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the schedule for an Alaska gas pipeline has slipped considerably. The states senior senator, Ted Stevens, a Republican famous for bringing big projects home, has openly expressed worry. And on Tuesday, Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, one of the companies that hopes to build the pipeline, said: I dont really know where we are. I dont think it looks like Alaska knows where it wants to go, either. Ms. Palin dismissed that talk. But next week, when she attends a National Governors Association meeting in Washington, she plans to visit Alaskas Congressional delegation and meet with officials at Exxon Mobil and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, among others. Besides putting minds at ease, she said, she wants to broaden the appeal of the project with the goal of gaining leverage in negotiations. This project is so much bigger than Alaska and Alaskas interests, Ms. Palin said. This is for the nation. This is to supply domestically safe sources of fuel. Were going to be able to do that. We should be leading in a national energy plan. The report by the energy commission suggested just such thinking, although it had a more urgent tone than in earlier assessments and sprinkled in some skepticism. The main obstacle to progress on an Alaskan gas pipeline is the failure to resolve state issues necessary before a project sponsor will commit to go forward, the report said. The fresh competitive approach announced by the new governor must be successful if Alaska gas is to be part of the nations energy supply solution in the coming years. Steve Rinehart, a spokesman for BP Exploration Alaska, which controls the most land in the area expected to be developed first, said that with natural gas prices projected to stay relatively high and oil production on the North Slope declining, the time has come to bring that gas to market. It makes sense economically, Mr. Rinehart said. It makes sense for the life of this oil field. But in the past, aides to Ms. Palin said, the big energy companies refused to commit to expanding the pipeline or to allow outside companies to use it for reasonable fees. Mr. Rinehart disagreed. We were ready to address those issues, he said, but the process stopped. Critical to pushing a plan through is the states 60-member, Republican-controlled Legislature. Mr. Murkowski, a former United States senator, clashed with state lawmakers over his pipeline plan through his final days in office. Ms. Palin, by contrast, has echoed their concerns about giving away too much in tax breaks to the energy companies. What the governor has is a lot of credibility with the public, said State Representative John Harris, the speaker of the House. Shes been a breath of fresh air, in my opinion. Lyda Green, president of the Senate, said Ms. Palin came to office without the intimate knowledge of the energy and financial industries that Mr. Murkowski had. But shes a very quick study, Ms. Green said. She has good people around her. Ms. Palin has brought back some top staff members who left in protest over how Mr. Murkowski had been conducting the pipeline negotiations. Now she wants them to help her complete the deal that Mr. Murkowski never could. We are crafting this whole process with our arms open, even for Exxon, Ms. Palin said. Come on in and let us know what you have in terms of a proposal to commercialize Alaskas natural gas. More Articles in National »JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 15  The new administration of Gov.

Fourth-quarter net income slid 13 percent, to $3.2 billion, or $1.91 a share, from $3.68 billion, or $2.61 a share, a year earlier, the company said in a statement. ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, is the first major oil company to report earnings for the fourth quarter, a period in which warm weather and increased supplies dragged down energy prices from the record highs of a year earlier. “That was kind of the high-water mark for the natural gas commodity,” said Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Wall Street Access in New York. Mr. Picchi owns ConocoPhillips shares and rates them a buy. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are scheduled to report earnings next week. Profit per share was 1 cent higher than the average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Mr. Picchi said earnings from refining, which were squeezed by a decline in gasoline prices, did not fall as much as he expected. Revenue fell 19 percent, to $41.5 billion, at least partly on an accounting change. Shares of ConocoPhillips rose 65 cents, to $65.62, on the New York Stock Exchange. The last time ConocoPhillips had a decline in profit was in the fourth quarter of 2002, the same year Phillips Petroleum created the company with its acquisition of Conoco. In the latest quarter, warmer-than-normal weather across much of the United States sapped demand for heating fuel, and the absence of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico helped bolster oil and gas inventories. Refining profit margins, or the gap between crude oil costs and prices for gasoline and diesel, narrowed to $7.69 a barrel processed, from $10.99 in the fourth quarter of 2005. ConocoPhillips is the second-largest United States refiner, ranking behind only Valero Energy of San Antonio, and gets a greater share of earnings from refining than its closest rivals do. Fourth-quarter earnings from refineries and filling stations fell 5.5 percent, to $919 million, ConocoPhillips said. ConocoPhillips said its profit from producing oil and gas fell 14 percent, to $2.09 billion, even as its completed deal to acquire Burlington Resources lifted production. Excluding a 20 percent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest oil company, output rose 29 percent, to the equivalent of 2.05 million barrels of oil a day. Capital spending at ConocoPhillips jumped to $16.3 billion last year, and the company added new reserves equivalent to just 11 percent of the oil and gas it pumped from the ground.

Picchi, an analyst at Wall Street Access in New York. Mr. Picchi owns ConocoPhillips shares and rates them a buy. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are scheduled to report earnings next week. Profit per share was 1 cent higher than the average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Mr. Picchi said earnings from refining, which were squeezed by a decline in gasoline prices, did not fall as much as he expected. Revenue fell 19 percent, to $41.5 billion, at least partly on an accounting change. Shares of ConocoPhillips rose 65 cents, to $65.62, on the New York Stock Exchange. The last time ConocoPhillips had a decline in profit was in the fourth quarter of 2002, the same year Phillips Petroleum created the company with its acquisition of Conoco. In the latest quarter, warmer-than-normal weather across much of the United States sapped demand for heating fuel, and the absence of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico helped bolster oil and gas inventories. Refining profit margins, or the gap between crude oil costs and prices for gasoline and diesel, narrowed to $7.69 a barrel processed, from $10.99 in the fourth quarter of 2005. ConocoPhillips is the second-largest United States refiner, ranking behind only Valero Energy of San Antonio, and gets a greater share of earnings from refining than its closest rivals do. Fourth-quarter earnings from refineries and filling stations fell 5.5 percent, to $919 million, ConocoPhillips said. ConocoPhillips said its profit from producing oil and gas fell 14 percent, to $2.09 billion, even as its completed deal to acquire Burlington Resources lifted production. Excluding a 20 percent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest oil company, output rose 29 percent, to the equivalent of 2.05 million barrels of oil a day. Capital spending at ConocoPhillips jumped to $16.3 billion last year, and the company added new reserves equivalent to just 11 percent of the oil and gas it pumped from the ground.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E6D71330F930A25752C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=conocophillipsinc">TODAY IN BUSINESS | OIL COMPANY TO BUY BACK SHARES<date>Published: January 13, 2007</date><text>ConocoPhillips, the oil company, said it planned to repurchase as much as $1 billion of its stock after it tightened capital expenditures in the wake of falling oil prices.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jamie Rose for The New York Times Earl E. Devaney is an Interior Department inspector general. Blog The Caucus Kate Phillips and The Times's politics staff are analyzing the midterm elections and looking ahead to 2008. More Politics News The new investigations are still in the early stages, said Congressional officials who were briefed this week by Earl E. Devaney, the Interior Department’s chief independent investigator. The investigations are an unexpected development in what has already become a broad examination of the Interior Department’s oversight of companies that pump more than $60 billion worth of oil and gas each year from publicly owned land and coastal waters. One Justice inquiry involves Interior Department officials in Denver who manage the government’s fast-growing program to collect “royalties in kind,” which are royalties in the form of oil and gas rather than in financial payments, people briefed on the investigation said. That investigation is being run by the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, which examines suspected criminal violations by federal employees. The focus of the second investigation is unclear, but it is being conducted by the inspector general with help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Devaney, the department’s inspector general, is already conducting two other investigations into suspected mismanagement of the minerals agency. And just last week, he issued a scathing criticism of the agency’s system for auditing oil and gas royalty payments. Mr. Devaney is also finishing up an investigation into how the Interior Department signed 1,100 oil and gas leases in the late 1990s that inadvertently permitted companies to avoid up to $10 billion in royalties over the next five years. The errors were made during the Clinton administration, but people briefed on Mr. Devaney’s investigation said he had concluded that high-ranking agency officials either knew or should have known about the problem at least two years ago. Representative Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said Thursday in a statement that Mr. Devaney had briefed his staff. “The two criminal referrals by the Department of Interior’s inspector general to the F.B.I. and Justice Department are proof positive that the conflicts of interest between Bush administration regulators and those they regulate in the oil and gas industry are costing the American taxpayers billions in royalty revenues,” Mr. Markey said. Word of the criminal investigations surfaced just as the Interior Department announced Thursday that five big oil producers had voluntarily renegotiated leases and agreed to not exploit a loophole that could save them hundreds of millions of dollars each. The leases gave companies an incentive to drill in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico by letting them skip royalties on millions of barrels of oil and gas. But the leases omitted a standard escape clause that would have required the companies to pay in full if oil prices rose above about $34 a barrel. Interior officials have said the mistake, if left unchanged, could cost the government as much as $10 billion. The Interior Department said Thursday that it had concluded new deals with BP, ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and Walter Oil and Gas. Those companies hold about 17 percent of the flawed leases, according to Interior data. But about 50 other companies have not yet agreed to change their leases. Among them is Chevron, one of the biggest potential beneficiaries of the error. Chevron and several partners could save more than $1 billion in royalties in years to come if the lease language is not changed. Don Campbell, a spokesman for Chevron, said company executives had met several times with government officials to resolve the matter. Mr. Campbell said his company “put a reasonable offer forward” and would “look forward to further discussions.” The new agreements did little to mollify the Interior Department’s Republican and Democratic critics in Congress. The incoming Democratic chairman and the retiring Republican chairman of the House Government Reform Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, suggesting that the leases might never have been valid and that the government might be able to force the companies to pay up. Officials have provided few details about the new criminal investigations, except to say they are “related” to previous inquiries of the royalty-management program. Started about six years ago, the royalty-in-kind program has become a multibillion trading program run from Denver. Since President Bush took office, Interior officials and many of the industry’s biggest producers have argued that the government should collect as much of its royalties as possible through “in kind” payments because, they say, the accounting is much simpler. In 2005, the Interior Department collected about $3 billion worth of royalties in oil and gas  about a third of the total. The government funnels much of the oil it receives to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but it sells virtually all its natural gas and sends the cash to the Treasury. Congressional officials briefed this week by Mr. Devaney said he had cautioned that both of the criminal investigations would last several more months. Mr. Devaney said it was possible the investigations would not lead to criminal charges, though he suggested that they should at least lead to disciplinary actions.

About $60 billion of oil and gas is produced every year on federal property. DURING a 22-year career, Bobby L. Maxwell routinely won accolades and awards as one of the Interior Departments best auditors in the nations oil patch, snaring promotions that eventually had him supervising a staff of 120 people. He and his team scrutinized the books of major oil producers that collectively pumped billions of dollars worth of oil and gas every year from land and coastal waters owned by the public. Along the way, the auditors recovered hundreds of millions of dollars from companies that shortchanged the government on royalties. Mr. Maxwells career has been characterized by exceptional performance and significant contributions, wrote Gale A. Norton, then the secretary of the interior, in a 2003 citation. Ms. Norton praised Mr. Maxwells perseverance and leadership while cataloguing his many outstanding achievements. Less than two years later, the Interior Department eliminated his job in what it called a reorganization. That came exactly one week after a federal judge in Denver unsealed a lawsuit in which Mr. Maxwell contended that a major oil company had spent years cheating on royalty payments. When I got this citation, they told me this would be very good for my career, said Mr. Maxwell, smiling during an interview here. Next thing I knew, they fired me. Today, at 53, Mr. Maxwell lives on a $44,000 annual pension in a two-bedroom bungalow in the hills outside the Hawaiian capital. But Mr. Maxwell has hardly disappeared. Instead, he is at the center of an escalating battle with both the oil industry and the Bush administration over how the federal government oversees about $60 billion worth of oil and gas produced every year on federal property. In the process, he has become one of the most nettlesome whistle-blowers Big Oil has ever encountered, a face-off that offers an inside look at how the industry and the government do business together. Invoking a law that rewards private citizens who expose fraud against the government, Mr. Maxwell has filed a suit in federal court in Denver against the Kerr-McGee Corporation. The suit accuses the company, which was recently acquired by Anadarko Petroleum, of bilking the government out of royalty payments. It also contends that the Interior Department ignored audits indicating that Kerr-McGee was cheating. Three other federal auditors, who once worked for Mr. Maxwell and still work at the Interior Department, have since filed similar suits of their own against other energy companies. Several of the nations biggest oil producers, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and ConocoPhillips, failed in an effort to block Mr. Maxwells suit, arguing before an appellate judge that his case would open the floodgates to suits by other federal auditors. But the court rejected their pleas, and a trial is set to start on Jan. 16. Mr. Maxwells self-interest is as much in play in the suit as is the public interest. If he wins, Kerr-McGee could be forced to pay more than $50 million in unpaid royalties and penalties, Mr. Maxwell said. Mr. Maxwell and his lawyers could be entitled to keep as much as 30 percent of any funds the government recovers  enough to make him a wealthy man. Anadarko says that the governments rules were followed and that it owes no money because the Interior Department never asked it to pay more. But it is now trying to negotiate a settlement before the trial begins. We believe the case is without merit, said John Christiansen, an Anadarko spokesman. However, as is a fairly common practice, both sides have agreed to meet with a mediator prior to trial. THE actions of Mr. Maxwell and the other auditors have coincided with broader investigations by Congress and the Interior Departments own inspector general into whether the agency properly collects the money for oil and gas pumped from public land. Investigators say they have found evidence of myriad problems at the department: cronyism and cover-ups of management blunders; capitulation to oil companies in disputes about payments; plunging morale among auditors; and unreliable data-gathering that often makes it impossible to determine how much money companies actually owe. In February, the Interior Department admitted that energy companies might escape more than $7 billion in royalty payments over the next five years because of errors in leases signed in the 1990s that officials are now scrambling to renegotiate. The errors were discovered in 2000, but were ignored for the next six years and have yet to be fixed. Congressional investigators are worried about other problems, as well. The Interior Departments inspector general told a House subcommittee in September that senior officials at the agency had repeatedly glossed over ethical lapses and bungling. Short of crime, anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of the Interior, declared Earl E.

ConocoPhillips, the second of five large oil companies to report this week, posted net income of $3.88 billion yesterday, a 2 percent increase from a year earlier. Oil prices were higher than a year earlier, averaging $70 a barrel, but natural gas and gasoline prices were lower, moderating the industrys profit growth prospects. BP said Tuesday that its third-quarter profit slipped 3.6 percent. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are scheduled to release their third-quarter results today. Per-share results for ConocoPhillips fell to $2.31 from $2.68 as the number of shares outstanding increased to 1.68 billion from 1.42 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected $2.38 a share. Nevertheless, a $2.05 surge in oil prices yesterday lifted shares of ConocoPhillips by $1.35, to $62.75. Total revenue, including sales and equity in joint ventures, rose to $49.9 billion from $49.66 billion a year earlier. The company had charges totaling 37 cents related to unfavorable tax changes in Britain, impairment on some refining and marketing assets held for sale, and the costs of new Alaska tax laws, and partially offset by an insurance gain. Analysts seemed less concerned with the third-quarter profit growth than with the companys long-term potential for increasing its output of oil and natural gas. ConocoPhillips announced a joint venture with EnCana this month to develop two Canadian oil fields and expand the capacity of two United States refineries. The chief executive, James J. Mulva, answered concerns about developments in Alaska. In Alaska, lawmakers have twice rejected Gov. Frank Murkowskis deal with ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and BP for a natural gas pipeline to Canada. On Nov. 7, voters will decide if the state should levy a $1 billion annual tax on companies that hold natural gas leases on Alaskas North Slope. Mr. Mulva said voter approval would not be conducive to pipeline development.

The action affected 19 of 406 licenses owned by Lukoil, a company that is 20 percent owned by ConocoPhillips of the United States. Lukoil said in a statement that it expected to resolve the complaints soon, and analysts agreed that was likely. Still, the enforcement action was significant because the same environmental regulator who is behind it suspended a permit last month for a $22 billion project operated by Royal Dutch Shell on Sakhalin Island. That regulator, Oleg L. Mitvol, deputy director of the environmental agency Rosprirodnadzor, has become a closely watched figure by Moscow energy analysts. Mr. Mitvol vowed that he would eventually inspect all energy companies working in Russia. In the politically tinged atmosphere of Russian energy politics, that statement seemed intended to counter criticism from diplomats and oil analysts that Mr. Mitvol had selectively enforced the rules against Shell. Mr. Mitvol said he would even inspect Rosneft and Gazprom, the state-controlled energy companies. He said he had no specific date to inspect Gazprom, but would do so before I leave this job. Mr. Mitvol said on Monday that he had given prosecutors evidence that Lukoil failed to explore or drill in the 19 fields according to the timelines laid out in the licenses. No action, no taxes, no jobs, he said of Lukoils alleged failures at the sites in the Komi region, a district that straddles the Arctic Circle almost directly north of Moscow. If a company doesnt have the money, isnt in the mood, or doesnt have the desire to develop a field, they should return it to the state, Mr. Mitvol said at a news conference. We will pass all our evidence to the prosecutors. It was unclear why Mr. Mitvol was pressing this issue because his agency is not directly responsible for energy licensing issues. If followed up, Mr. Mitvols latest charges could take a chip out of Lukoil by stripping it of licenses and further the process of nationalizing Russias energy industry that began with the Yukos affair in 2003. Yukos is now in liquidation after the government demanded billions of dollars in back taxes. Its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who was a political opponent of President Vladimir V. Putin, is serving eight years in prison for fraud and tax evasion. Lukoil pumped 1.4 million barrels of oil a day in 2005. The company, which has operations in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, earned $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2006. At home, Lukoil was seen as a company loyal to the Kremlin, or at least careful to keep a low political profile; its chief executive, Vagit Y. Alekperov, has reportedly kept a photograph of President Putin on his desk. Still, Lukoil, as are most oil companies in Russia, is vulnerable on environmental issues. It was responsible for the largest oil spill in recent Russian history, when pipe ruptures caused by corrosion leaked about one million barrels of crude onto the tundra in the Komi region in 1994. After a tour of Lukoil drilling sites in the region, Mr. Mitvol levied a number of accusations. Mr. Mitvol visited the village of Ust-Usa, where he said inhabitants told him of black ice in a local river, which he described as ice floes colored black from oil spills upstream. Mr. Mitvol said he also found a Lukoil drilling rig in a national forest and tundra still contaminated by the 1994 spill.

He said he had no specific date to inspect Gazprom, but would do so before I leave this job. Mr. Mitvol said on Monday that he had given prosecutors evidence that Lukoil failed to explore or drill in the 19 fields according to the timelines laid out in the licenses. No action, no taxes, no jobs, he said of Lukoils alleged failures at the sites in the Komi region, a district that straddles the Arctic Circle almost directly north of Moscow. If a company doesnt have the money, isnt in the mood, or doesnt have the desire to develop a field, they should return it to the state, Mr. Mitvol said at a news conference. We will pass all our evidence to the prosecutors. It was unclear why Mr. Mitvol was pressing this issue because his agency is not directly responsible for energy licensing issues. If followed up, Mr. Mitvols latest charges could take a chip out of Lukoil by stripping it of licenses and further the process of nationalizing Russias energy industry that began with the Yukos affair in 2003. Yukos is now in liquidation after the government demanded billions of dollars in back taxes. Its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who was a political opponent of President Vladimir V. Putin, is serving eight years in prison for fraud and tax evasion. Lukoil pumped 1.4 million barrels of oil a day in 2005. The company, which has operations in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, earned $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2006. At home, Lukoil was seen as a company loyal to the Kremlin, or at least careful to keep a low political profile; its chief executive, Vagit Y. Alekperov, has reportedly kept a photograph of President Putin on his desk. Still, Lukoil, as are most oil companies in Russia, is vulnerable on environmental issues. It was responsible for the largest oil spill in recent Russian history, when pipe ruptures caused by corrosion leaked about one million barrels of crude onto the tundra in the Komi region in 1994. After a tour of Lukoil drilling sites in the region, Mr. Mitvol levied a number of accusations. Mr. Mitvol visited the village of Ust-Usa, where he said inhabitants told him of black ice in a local river, which he described as ice floes colored black from oil spills upstream. Mr. Mitvol said he also found a Lukoil drilling rig in a national forest and tundra still contaminated by the 1994 spill.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/business/worldbusiness/06sands.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Conoco and EnCana Plan Oil Sands Venture<date>Published: October 6, 2006</date><text>OTTAWA, Oct. 5  ConocoPhillips said Thursday that it would combine ownership of two of its refineries in Texas with Canadian oil sands properties controlled by the oil and gas producer EnCana. The two partners also agreed to invest more than $10 billion over the next decade to expand the joint ventures production. The deal ends EnCanas long search for a partner to process the heavy tar, or bitumen, it extracts from surrounding rock and sand by injecting high-pressure steam into wells. But the decision to send more of that material to the United States for processing may prove unpopular in the companys home province, Alberta. The venture will be divided into two new companies, each owned equally by Conoco and EnCana. One, to be based in Calgary, where EnCana has its headquarters, will take control of two EnCana oil sands projects in northeastern Alberta. The other will own ConocoPhillips refineries in Roxana, Ill., and Borger, Tex., and will be based in Houston, ConocoPhillipss headquarters city. The two partners said they had not determined how the heavy oil would be sent south to the refineries, although they acknowledged that additional pipeline capacity would have to be created. High oil prices over the last year or two have increased interest in oil sands projects, which require more capital and involve higher operating costs than conventional oil wells. In a conference call with analysts and reporters, EnCanas chief financial officer, Brian C. Ferguson, said the new venture had been structured on the assumption that oil prices would average $50 a barrel, about $10 below current prices. He added that the project would be viable even if oil fell to $40 a barrel. Not all analysts were convinced of that. I dont believe if the oil prices goes below $45 a barrel, this will be as economically attractive as it looks today, Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer &amp; Company told Reuters. While EnCana did not rule out developing processing facilities in Alberta, it and many other companies are unwilling to do that today. The development of the oil sands has already led to a labor and materials shortage and greatly increased construction costs in the province. But because refineries offer long-term employment, there has been a growing political call for their development along with oil sands mines in Alberta. Last week Jim Dinning, a provincial legislator who is considered most likely to succeed Albertas departing premier, Ralph Klein, said in a speech that he was concerned about heavy oil from the tar sands being shipped out for processing in the United States. I believe if you mine it here, you upgrade it here, Mr. Dinning said. Mr. Klein, a political fixture on the right in Alberta, announced his resignation on Sept. 20. Mr. Dinning is seeking the leadership of the provinces Conservative Party, which over the years has rarely interfered with business and is closely tied to the oil and gas industry. EnCanas chief executive, Randall K. Eresman, said the political debate was not likely to have any effect on the joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval in Canada and the United States.

To re-energize the talks, which began five years ago, President Bush had proposed a sweeping set of cuts in tariffs and subsidies last October. The European Union, which had cut its farm aid earlier, followed with more cuts, but the United States said they were not enough. The failure makes it almost impossible for President Bush to reach an agreement and get it fully ratified before he leaves office. BIG DEAL HCA, the nations largest for-profit hospital operator, agreed to be acquired by private investors in what would be the largest leveraged buyout in history. Including about $11.7 billion of HCAs debt, the deal would be worth about $33 billion. The investors group was led by the family of Senator Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader. His father, Thomas Frist Sr., and brother, Thomas F. Frist Jr., founded HCA. Other investors are Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the private equity arm of Merrill Lynch. The buyers said the aging baby boom generation should increase the demand for hospital beds, but skeptics said cost-cutting by insurers would impair hospital profitability in the future. More such deals are likely because private equity firms have raised large pools of capital. The Blackstone Group recently said it had $15.6 billion in commitments for its latest buyout fund. OPENING UP The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a sweeping set of rules to make it easier to see how much companies were paying their top executives and to discourage the manipulation of stock-option grants. It is the biggest overhaul of the rules governing the disclosure of executive pay in almost 15 years. The rules, which will go into effect in mid-December, call for companies to give more information on all parts of executive compensation, including new information on the lump-sum cost of management pensions and stock-option grants. The commission also agreed to revisit the issue of whether to require the disclosure of compensation to other highly paid employees, a requirement known as the Katie Couric clause.

It was the second-largest quarterly profit ever posted by any publicly traded company, topped only by Exxons $10.71 billion quarter ended Dec. 31. Others were equally big. Chevron, the second-largest oil company, said it earned $4.35 billion for the three months ended in June, an 18 percent increase from the quarter last year. It was the most profitable quarter in the companys 127-year history. ConocoPhillips, the No. 3 American oil company, said its profit leapt by nearly two-thirds, to $5.19 billion, in the second quarter. Profits may increase next quarter, analysts said, because crude oil prices are rising, from just under $70 a barrel on average last quarter to $75 yesterday.

Skip to next paragraph Related Conoco Second-Quarter Results (pdf) The company, based in Houston, said it earned $5.19 billion in the second quarter, compared with $3.14 billion in the period last year. Nearly all of its businesses, which include offshore oil drilling, natural gas exploration and operating oil refineries, reported profit growth. Conocos results, which exceeded the expectations of many analysts, are expected to set the pace for what oil analysts predict will be another round of reports of soaring profit from the industry. Its exploration and production business earned $3.3 billion, accounting for 64 percent of the overall gain in net income for the quarter. The company stepped up output of oil and natural gas by 38 percent, taking advantage of new production capacity it gained by acquiring Burlington Resources for $35.6 billion in December. The deal made Conoco the largest natural gas producer in the United States. Refining profits rose as well, though not as sharply. Conocos 2006 results are far outpacing the record profits the company posted last year, when it had $13.53 billion in net income. Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, earned $36.1 billion last year. Its second-quarter results are expected this week, as are those of Chevron and Shell. BP, the global energy group, was the first major oil company out of the gate, reporting on Tuesday that it earned $7.27 billion, up 30 percent from the second quarter a year ago. All of the major oil companies are expected to post robust results from exploration and production, on the strength of crude prices driven to record highs recently by turmoil in the Middle East and in other oil-producing areas and by strong global demand. By BPs reckoning, a barrel of oil fetched an average price of $69.59 in the second quarter, and benchmark grades of crude have been trading in the mid-$70s this week. Though not quite as spectacular as the production side, the gain in Conocos refining and marketing division was large, with earnings of $1.71 billion compared with $1.11 billion a year earlier. The company said it increased both volume and margins at its refineries, which helped offset a loss in the marketing unit. Conocos earnings, equivalent to $3.09 a share, far surpassed the $2.81 a share that analysts had forecast on average, according to a survey by Thompson Financial. Shares of Conoco rose on the news yesterday, trading just under $70 a share in the early afternoon, a gain of 3 percent from Tuesdays close. The shares rose $1.15, to close at $68.60.

But one of the most active players in the gulf, the Kerr-McGee Corporation, showed no signs of compromise and told a House hearing that it was entitled to the subsidies  known as royalty relief  even if oil prices remained above $70 a barrel. And Exxon Mobil said it saw no reason for the subsidies to be changed. The sharp split among some of the world's biggest energy companies highlighted the political and legal difficulties that Congress and the Bush administration face in correcting an error that could cost the government as much as $10 billion in royalties over the next 25 years from oil and gas produced in publicly owned waters. Republicans and Democrats are both seeking to prevent the giveaway, even as House Republicans pushed ahead on Wednesday with a separate bill to open up vast areas along the outer continental shelf to natural gas production. On Wednesday, the House Resources Committee passed a measure that would lift the 25-year-old federal ban on natural gas production that covers most of the nation's coastal areas. Individual states that oppose such drilling, like Florida, would be allowed to impose their own prohibitions. In theory, the federal government is supposed to collect a royalty of 12 or 16 percent on all oil and gas produced in federal waters. But under a program aimed at encouraging production in the Gulf of Mexico, the Interior Department allowed companies to escape royalty on much of the oil and gas they produce. And in a mistake that is now the subject of multiple investigations, the Interior Department omitted a key restriction for leases signed in 1998 and 1999 that requires companies to pay full royalties if oil and gas prices climb above certain thresholds. Testifying before a House subcommittee on government reform, executives from Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips said they were ready to discuss a change in their leases. "Shell does not believe deepwater royalty relief is necessary in the current commodity price environment," said John Hofmeister, president of Shell's operations in the United States. Saying his company is willing to "make a change," Mr. Hofmeister said Shell began discussions with the Interior Department on Tuesday. Executives at Chevron and ConocoPhillips said they were open to discussions as well. Exxon Mobil said it was "happy to participate" in discussions, but insisted that "we expect the terms of existing leases to be honored." By far the toughest stance came from Kerr-McGee, which is not only refusing to concede any errors in its leases but also is suing the federal government to greatly expand the incentives it already offers. If Kerr-McGee wins its court fight, the Government Accountability Office has estimated that the government could lose an additional $60 billion over the next 25 years. "We don't believe there was a clerical error or any other kind of error," said Gregory F. Pilcher, senior vice president and general counsel at Kerr-McGee. In a suit filed earlier this year, Kerr-McGee contends that Congress never authorized the Interior Department to impose the price-based restrictions on incentives in any leases signed from 1995 through 2000. "It would be unfair and unwise for Congress to take a step toward changing the rules," Mr. Pilcher told members of the House subcommittee. "Ultimately, the courts should decide whether we are right or whether we are wrong." Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Government Reform subcommittee on energy, accused Kerr-McGee of acting in "bad faith." "I call it 'bad faith' if someone signs a contract voluntarily and does not object to the provisions, yet when the time comes to pay, they object and file suit," Mr. Issa said in a statement at the end of the hearing. "That sounds like a violation of contract sanctity to me." Still unexplained is how Interior officials during the Clinton administration made the mistake, and why they never alerted Congress to the problem. Testifying under oath, two current and one former Interior official who worked on the leases told lawmakers they had not noticed the omission until 1999  and even then did not write a memo about the problem. "My review was pretty much an executive-level review," said Milo Mason, a senior lawyer in the solicitor's office of the Interior Department. When he found out about the omission, Mr. Mason said, he never wrote about it. "It didn't seem like a big deal, as it is now," he said. But at least two oil executives told the panel that their companies had noticed the omission almost immediately. "We assumed they were creating an additional incentive," said A. Tim Cejka, president of Exxon Exploration. Paul Siegele, Chevron's vice president for deepwater development, said his company had asked Interior officials about the omission in 1998 and were told  incorrectly, it turned out  that the restriction was part of a new federal regulation rather than in the leases themselves. In May, the House approved a measure proposed by Democrats that would punish companies that refuse to renegotiate their leases by barring them from acquiring any additional leases. Oil companies and the American Petroleum Institute are lobbying to kill the measure, which was attached to the Interior Department's spending bill, before it emerges from a House-Senate conference committee. The House Resources Committee, meanwhile, approved a bill on Wednesday that would seek to pressure oil companies by imposing a stiff "conservation fee" on companies that refuse to pay full royalties when oil prices climb above $40 a barrel and natural gas prices exceed $6.75 per million B.T.U.'s . The Bush administration is seeking to persuade oil companies to change their contracts voluntarily. "If industry wanted to voluntarily talk about it, we'd be willing to talk," Johnnie M. Burton, director of the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, told Bloomberg News last week. More Articles in Washington »WASHINGTON, June 21  Facing angry lawmakers from both political parties, executives from three major oil companies  Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips  indicated on Wednesday that they might be willing to give up sizable taxpayer subsidies for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. But one of the most active players in the gulf, the Kerr-McGee Corporation, showed no signs of compromise and told a House hearing that it was entitled to the subsidies  known as royalty relief  even if oil prices remained above $70 a barrel. And Exxon Mobil said it saw no reason for the subsidies to be changed. The sharp split among some of the world's biggest energy companies highlighted the political and legal difficulties that Congress and the Bush administration face in correcting an error that could cost the government as much as $10 billion in royalties over the next 25 years from oil and gas produced in publicly owned waters. Republicans and Democrats are both seeking to prevent the giveaway, even as House Republicans pushed ahead on Wednesday with a separate bill to open up vast areas along the outer continental shelf to natural gas production. On Wednesday, the House Resources Committee passed a measure that would lift the 25-year-old federal ban on natural gas production that covers most of the nation's coastal areas. Individual states that oppose such drilling, like Florida, would be allowed to impose their own prohibitions. In theory, the federal government is supposed to collect a royalty of 12 or 16 percent on all oil and gas produced in federal waters. But under a program aimed at encouraging production in the Gulf of Mexico, the Interior Department allowed companies to escape royalty on much of the oil and gas they produce. And in a mistake that is now the subject of multiple investigations, the Interior Department omitted a key restriction for leases signed in 1998 and 1999 that requires companies to pay full royalties if oil and gas prices climb above certain thresholds. Testifying before a House subcommittee on government reform, executives from Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips said they were ready to discuss a change in their leases. "Shell does not believe deepwater royalty relief is necessary in the current commodity price environment," said John Hofmeister, president of Shell's operations in the United States. Saying his company is willing to "make a change," Mr. Hofmeister said Shell began discussions with the Interior Department on Tuesday. Executives at Chevron and ConocoPhillips said they were open to discussions as well.

A breeze picks up on the streets of Paris, scattering leaves and newspapers and blowing a man's bowler hat down a boulevard in a mighty gust. A voice-over explains: ''As a source of energy wind power alone cannot do it all. Just to power a city like Paris would need 20,000 wind turbines.'' The camera pans up to show the Eiffel Tower converted into a huge lumbering windmill. Chevron ran the advertisement on NTV television, a station owned by Gazprom, from March 24 until April 17, according to TNS Gallop AdFact, an ad tracking agency in Moscow. Statoil of Norway also ran ads on NTV. It just so happens that Chevron and Statoil are two of several companies seeking business with Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly. Analysts and company officials say that foreign companies are so eager to do business with Gazprom that they are trying to win favor or at least notice by running advertisements on Gazprom-owned media in Russia. Chevron and ConocoPhillips of the United States, Statoil and Hydro of Norway and Total of France are now in talks with Gazprom to join a consortium to develop the Shtokman offshore gas deposit estimated to hold 3.7 trillion cubic meters. All of the companies except Conoco have run ads in Russia during the negotiations, according to TNS Gallop. Though they have limited retail business here, the companies have run at least 33 television spots and 86 print advertisements in Moscow from January 2005 until this April, roughly the period of negotiations for the project, according to Gallop. Chevron said its ad was shown earlier in other countries and broadcast as part of a worldwide campaign to encourage debate about energy issues. A Chevron spokesman in London, Michael R. Barrett, said the timing of the placement in Russia was coincidental and not intended to raise Chevron's visibility during the Shtokman talks. Paul A. Floren, a spokesman for Total, said in a telephone interview that any advertising in Russia was part of a worldwide campaign unrelated to Shtokman. ''Gazprom is on an expansionist drive and they've been snubbed in Europe,'' said Ivan N. Mazalov, an energy analyst at Prosperity Capital Management in Moscow. ''This is why Gazprom wants to get some PR services.'' The Statoil spots on NTV profile the company's new Snoehvit platform in the North Sea off Norway, a structure with technologies similar to those needed to develop the Russian deposit, according to Statoil. Kai Nielsen, a spokesman for Statoil, said that his company often ran advertising timed to enhance its image during negotiations or large energy conferences and that this was common practice in the industry. ''It's quite normal,'' he said. ''We've seen it in other countries. Even though we are famous in Norway, we have to realize that we are not famous all over the world.'' The intended audience, he said, ''is not the man in the street'' because Statoil has limited retail business in Russia. ''It's the decision makers and the people around them we target.'' Asked why Statoil chose NTV for its advertising, Mr. Nielsen said an external publicity agency in London advised his company to place ads on that channel. Simon Blakey, a Paris-based analyst of European natural gas markets for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said talks on the 40-year $20 billion development would not hinge on questions of image. Dividing risk and capital costs are crucial in negotiating such big energy deals, he said. Gazprom this year budgeted $124 million for public relations. But, as the Chevron ad suggests, Western energy companies are also helping by speaking well of a potential partner and rich source of reserves in an era of ever tighter global supply. Just last month, the German energy companies BASF and E.On both publicly supported Gazprom's expansion plans in Europe. E.On's chief executive called criticism of the Russians ''completely exaggerated and overblown.'' While Mr. Mazalov at Prosperity Capital said it was unlikely there was an expressed quid pro quo for the good press, a number of energy companies that do business with Gazprom or hope to do so have become vocal in Gazprom's support recently. BASF on April 27 obtained just under 25 percent in a big Siberian gas field in an asset swap with Gazprom while E.On is now negotiating for a similar share. Hydro and Statoil ran advertisements profiling the companies' technical prowess in offshore drilling, reflecting these companies' expected roles in the Shtokman consortium. To highlight its expertise in underwater engineering, Hydro ran a print ad showing the open surface of the ocean with text that said, ''the next oil and gas platform in Russia may look like this,'' or entirely submerged. Lars Bjelvin, a spokesman, said the ads were intended to reinforce Hydro's position in the talks by highlighting what the company does well. An official with a German company working closely with Gazprom executives said the ads were noticed. He did not want his name used because of his company's business with Gazprom. ''Will it get Chevron brownie points? Will it get them closer to a role in Shtokman? I don't know,'' the official said. ''At least it won't hurt.''</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EED9113FF931A35756C0A9609C8B63&amp;ref=conocophillipsinc">World Business Briefing | Middle East: Saudi Arabia: Two New Refineries Planned<date>Published: May 2, 2006</date><text>Total and ConocoPhillips will sign an agreement this month with Saudi Aramco, the oil company, to build and operate two new refineries in Saudi Arabia at a cost of $12 billion, a Saudi official said.

It was the second time in four months that the oil industry faced strong criticism from both Republican and Democratic senators. In November, the Senate held similar hearings, which produced a show of indignation but were followed by little legislation. Most of the companies represented, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, participated in the wave of mega-mergers of the late 1990's and early 2000 that created today's behemoths. Given the sharp rise in oil prices, the top five of them reaped record earnings of well over $100 billion. Senator Arlen Specter, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the hearings to examine whether mergers in the oil and gas industry had resulted in higher gasoline prices at the pump. Gasoline prices jumped above $3 a gallon after Hurricane Katrina last summer and are now about $2.37 a gallon. They have risen by 60 percent in the last five years. "We do know that there have been mergers and that gasoline prices have risen," Senator Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said in his opening remarks. He proposed to introduce a bill that would tighten scrutiny on mergers that might hurt competition and would reconsider some of the $14.5 billion tax incentives that were granted to energy companies in last year's energy law. Increasingly, rising energy and fuel costs are becoming potent issues in Washington. In his State of the Union message in January, President Bush said that he wanted to cut America's "addiction" to oil and develop alternative fuels. When five oil executives testified last November, they successfully lobbied for their top executives to be spared the fate of tobacco executives, who were made to testify under oath in 1994. After the hearings, some Democrats said that the executives had misled them with incomplete and inaccurate answers. Yesterday, the executives, six of them this time, were sworn in. This formality created the very kind of picture  some of the most powerful American executives lined up with their right hands up in the air  that oil executives had sought to avoid. Otherwise, theatrics were largely absent although the arguments from the oil executives were the same. "With respect to the committee's specific question  whether mergers and acquisitions in our industry have contributed to higher prices at the pump  my answer is no," Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive since January, said in response to Senator Specter. "We need U.S. energy companies that have the scale and financial strength to make the investments, undertake the risks and develop the new technologies necessary to provide Americans with greater energy access and greater energy security," he said. John Hofmeister, the president of Royal Dutch Shell's American unit, said that despite the immense size of the largest oil companies, "this remains a highly competitive industry." Also testifying were the top representatives of Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP America, and Valero, the nation's largest independent refiner. While oil prices remain high, the American economy has so far absorbed the increased energy costs. Still, in an election year, politicians seemed eager to turn the heat on oil men. Exxon Mobil came under the most criticism. The company was formed in 1999 from the merger of Exxon, the top American oil company, with Mobil, the No. 2. Last year, it earned net income of $36.1 billion. There have been 2,600 mergers since 1991 in the oil and gas industry, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said that the degree of competition and the amount of market power held by oil companies following the mergers raised "really serious questions." "Although each of these mergers reduced the companies' costs they were nevertheless followed by increases in the costs to consumers," she said. Speaking during a witness panel before the industry executives, Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said oil companies were not solely responsible for high gasoline prices. "It's a world market for oil and that's why we have high gasoline prices," Mr. Borenstein said. Senator Specter's proposed legislation would also permit the government to take legal action against the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for fixing oil prices. "One of the biggest causes of high crude oil prices is the illegal price-fixing of the OPEC cartel," said Senator Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, a sponsor of the provision. Still, there were some moments of levity, such as when Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said: "Our constituents, your consumers, aren't very happy with your explanations. If you'd be losing money, they wouldn't be so upset." One senator  John Cornyn, Republican of Texas  defended the industry, providing the oil executives with an easy plank to make their case. "Since it isn't a crime to make a profit, what I would ask is, What can the government do that would be positive to bring down the price of oil and gas?" the senator asked. "Would it be productive or destructive for us to pass a windfall profit tax?" The answer from the executives, of course, was "not productive."

Frank H. Murkowski put it, a milestone toward building a natural gas pipeline. But significant political, environmental and regulatory hurdles must be overcome before a single section of pipe meets a welding torch. After prolonged negotiations, Governor Murkowski announced late Monday that Alaska had reached an agreement in principle with BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil to build a $20 billion pipeline from the North Slope to the lower 48 states by way of Canada. As envisioned, the pipeline would move 4.5 billion to 6 billion cubic feet of gas daily and begin operating sometime from 2012 to 2014. Alaska has an estimated 35 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. The announcement came with news of a significant change to the oil royalty system that provides most of Alaska's state budget revenue. Under the plan, the system will be shifted to one based on net profit rather than the volume of production. "These are two historic events," Governor Murkowski said, "ones that will define the state's economy for decades to come." Almost no one denies that changes to the royalty system, which now provides about 83 percent of the state's revenue, will have a potentially significant effect. But some gas analysts cautioned that the pipeline's future would be shaped by forces well beyond the governor's control. "This agreement is only one step on the part of one potential applicant to build a project," said Arlon Tussing, a research economist at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who specializes in gas projects. "The final decision about this is going to be made by the respective regulatory authorities in the United States and Canada, as well as their governments. And there's going to be tremendous opposition." The plan will meet its most immediate tests in Alaska's Legislature, where Democrats have criticized the governor's decision to reduce proposed pipeline taxes to 20 percent of profit from an earlier plan of 25 percent. The broader overhaul of the oil tax system is also expected to face criticism. And there is substantial popular support for another proposal in Alaska that would build a smaller pipeline to Anchorage and the port of Valdez, and then ship the gas south by tanker. Nonetheless, the political maneuvering at the state level may prove easier to resolve than other issues. The idea of increasing American gas supplies using American sources has obvious political and national security appeal, particularly given that the fuel is increasingly used as a substitute for coal in electricity-generating stations. André Plourde, an energy economist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said that the world's largest known gas reserves were concentrated in countries not known for political stability, notably Iran and Russia. "Given the Bush administration's focus on what it considers to be energy security," Mr. Plourde said, "Alaska is going to get a favorable hearing." But if natural gas prices drop from their current levels, as many expect, economic concerns may outweigh the emphasis on security. If the forecasts of Professor Tussing and others bear out, gas piped from Alaska will have a difficult time competing with gas shipped by tanker from low-cost producers overseas. Professor Tussing estimates that North American gas reserves are now about 9.5 times annual production. Reserves elsewhere, by contrast, are 88 times production. "That means it is a lot easier to increase production almost anywhere other than North America," he said. "We have pretty much wrung out the continent." A preview of some regulatory issues facing an Alaska pipeline might be found in more advanced efforts to build a gas pipeline from the Canadian Arctic. That project, with investors that also include Exxon Mobil, has been repeatedly delayed, in part because of issues surrounding land claims by native groups along the route. The Alaskan project will encounter similar issues over permission to dip into the Yukon Territory and parts of Alberta. Climate change may also complicate environmental reviews. Antoni Lewkowicz, a professor of geography at the University of Ottawa, worked on permafrost issues surrounding an Alaska pipeline plan more than 20 years ago. A pattern of warming weather in the Arctic today, he warned, will make engineering the current proposal difficult and costly. "One of the things that killed the pipeline back in 1982 was the expense of the permafrost accommodations," Professor Lewkowicz said. "Today, it's going to be very difficult to come up with a design that can deal with current conditions and the climate changes that will occur over the next 30 to 50 years. It's a significant and very costly engineering challenge." More Articles in Business &gt;OTTAWA, Feb. 22  A conditional agreement between Alaska and three big energy companies may be, as Gov. Frank H. Murkowski put it, a milestone toward building a natural gas pipeline. But significant political, environmental and regulatory hurdles must be overcome before a single section of pipe meets a welding torch. After prolonged negotiations, Governor Murkowski announced late Monday that Alaska had reached an agreement in principle with BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil to build a $20 billion pipeline from the North Slope to the lower 48 states by way of Canada. As envisioned, the pipeline would move 4.5 billion to 6 billion cubic feet of gas daily and begin operating sometime from 2012 to 2014. Alaska has an estimated 35 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. The announcement came with news of a significant change to the oil royalty system that provides most of Alaska's state budget revenue. Under the plan, the system will be shifted to one based on net profit rather than the volume of production. "These are two historic events," Governor Murkowski said, "ones that will define the state's economy for decades to come." Almost no one denies that changes to the royalty system, which now provides about 83 percent of the state's revenue, will have a potentially significant effect. But some gas analysts cautioned that the pipeline's future would be shaped by forces well beyond the governor's control. "This agreement is only one step on the part of one potential applicant to build a project," said Arlon Tussing, a research economist at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who specializes in gas projects. "The final decision about this is going to be made by the respective regulatory authorities in the United States and Canada, as well as their governments. And there's going to be tremendous opposition." The plan will meet its most immediate tests in Alaska's Legislature, where Democrats have criticized the governor's decision to reduce proposed pipeline taxes to 20 percent of profit from an earlier plan of 25 percent.

The spill occurred on Friday morning after a valve froze and cracked, said Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. A refinery worker discovered the spill about 8 a.m. along a road near the Linden landfill. Ms. Makatura said the red oil-and-water mixture leaked into the river and the Arthur Kill, which winds between New Jersey and Staten Island, before workers were able to shut off the valve. State and federal environmental cleanup crews, the United States Coast Guard and local contractors hired by ConocoPhillips set up floating booms to keep the slick from spreading and were using skimmers and vacuums to remove the oil from the river and the shoreline. Ms. Makatura said she did not know how many gallons had been cleaned up by last evening. ConocoPhillips executives could not be reached for comment yesterday. The spill occurred in an inaccessible part of the river, and so far its effects on wildlife have been limited, Ms. Makatura said. A rabbit and a goose were found along the shoreline and were being cleaned, she added. "Right now the concentration is working around the clock on a diligent cleanup," Ms. Makatura said.

The acquisition would give ConocoPhillips, the nation's third-largest oil company, control of important natural-gas exploration areas in the United States, where Burlington has been using new drilling technologies in its search for new reserves. Other major oil companies, including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, have been moving aggressively in recent months to increase their own natural-gas production in this country. The negotiations come against a backdrop of soaring natural-gas prices around the nation following hurricanes this year that knocked out production at platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Frigid temperatures in some parts of the country in recent days have pushed prices even higher. Last week, natural gas prices reached more than $15 per thousand cubic feet in trading, a near record. Talks between ConocoPhillips and Burlington are near completion, the executives said, but they warned that it was still possible the negotiations could collapse. If a deal is reached, it could be announced as early as this week. Details of the terms of the transaction under discussion could not be learned. Burlington, based in Houston, has more than 2,200 workers. The company has about 12 trillion cubic feet equivalent of natural-gas reserves, mostly in North America. However, the acquisition would also help ConocoPhillips internationally, expanding its reach in countries like Ecuador and Canada where Burlington has made inroads. A spokesman for Burlington declined to comment. A representative for ConocoPhillips could not be reached. ConocoPhillips, a company formed through a string of earlier mergers, has been using acquisitions to help it grow. In late November, for instance, it acquired an oil refinery in Germany from a private concern, Louis Dreyfus, in a deal valued at about $2.5 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. The transaction also signals an ambition by the chief executive of ConocoPhillips, James J. Mulva, to eventually secure a seat at the table with the elite international energy companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Royal Dutch Shell. ConocoPhillips is the largest energy company in Houston, but it has been unable to attain the extensive international reach of its larger competitors. The deal is expected to ignite interest in similar transactions in Houston, which has recently seen a jump in merger activity because of rising oil and natural-gas prices. The higher prices, coupled with difficulty at larger companies in discovering large new petroleum reserves, have encouraged some companies to consider acquisitions as a way of getting access to new areas of production and refining. A deal with ConocoPhillips would also keep a foreign company from buying Burlington, though it is still possible one could submit a bid in the next several days. When Cnooc, a Chinese state-owned oil company, attempted to acquire Unocal earlier this year, it touched off a political firestorm in this country. Cash to finance such deals is not an issue. ConocoPhillips, for instance, had net income of $3.80 billion in the most recent quarter, up from $2.01 billion from the same period a year earlier. Revenue at the company was $49.66 billion, compared with $34.74 billion in the year-earlier period. Earnings at other large energy companies are expected to remain near record levels through the end of this year. ConocoPhilips could be buying Burlington at the height of the market, analysts said. As natural-gas prices have soared, so have Burlington's shares - they have almost doubled in the past year. The stock closed at $76.09 on Friday.

Shares of ConocoPhillips, which is based in Houston, gained 36 cents, to $62.80 yesterday, as the company beat Wall Street expectations, in part because of the contribution by its stake in a Russian oil company, Lukoil. ConocoPhillips produced 1.79 million barrels of oil and gas a day on average over the quarter, including 270,000 barrels a day from its investment in Lukoil. It doubled the stake it owns in that company to 14.8 percent after investing $2 billion to buy the Russian government's share last year. Under the agreement, ConocoPhillips can raise its stake to 20 percent.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EEDE1130F937A35753C1A9639C8B63&amp;ref=conocophillipsinc">World Business Briefing | Europe: Russia: ConocoPhillips' Lukoil Stake<date>Published: October 4, 2005</date><text>ConocoPhillips said it had increased its stake in Lukoil to 14.8 percent while the companies press ahead with a venture to export crude from the Russian Arctic. Conoco is entitled to buy up to 20 percent of Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, under an agreement announced last year. Conoco raised its stake from 12.6 percent at the end of the second quarter. The companies will develop fields in Timan-Pechora Province through a joint venture. Last week, the companies sought bids for three or four ice-capable tankers. The tankers will ship crude from the Arctic to an ice-free harbor in Russia or Europe, a Lukoil spokesman said. The project is eventually expected to export Russian crude to the East Coast of the United States.

"We didn't seek this fight, and we're not running away from it if it means taking on one of the largest corporations in the world," Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association's executive vice president, said in a phone interview from Washington after returning from Oklahoma, where he had announced the boycott on Monday night. The association is focusing its wrath on ConocoPhillips because the company joined a federal lawsuit to block an Oklahoma law that allows employees to keep guns in cars parked in company lots. The law was enacted after 12 workers were fired from a Weyerhaeuser paper mill in southeast Oklahoma in 2002. ConocoPhillips - the largest company based in Houston and the largest oil refiner in the country, with assets of $97 billion - did not respond in detail. A spokesman, Jeffrey Callender, said the company had been "in touch with the N.R.A. throughout the process" and "at this point was continuing to maintain its stance." ConocoPhillips also issued a short statement saying that it supported the Second Amendment and the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns. "Our primary concern is the safety of all our employees," the company said, adding, "We are simply trying to provide a safe and secure working environment for our employees by keeping guns out of our facilities, including our company parking lots." The Williams Companies, another major energy company, and Halliburton have also joined the lawsuit, but ConocoPhillips was selected because of its size, Mr. LaPierre said. Whirlpool had originally brought the lawsuit, but a spokesman, Stephen Duthie, said it dropped out after assurances from the state attorney general that the law would not affect the company's authority to keep guns off its property; Mr. Duthie said the rifle association had not influenced that decision. Halliburton, the energy services giant whose subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root employed six of the fired workers, said Tuesday that it continued to side with ConocoPhillips against the Oklahoma law. "It is our view that firearms should not be permitted on premises where Halliburton conducts business and that the law should not require the company to allow them," said a spokeswoman, Cathy Mann. Another company, the Nordam Group, a maker of aircraft components, also has submitted briefs in support of the lawsuit. The chief executive, Ken Lackey, called guns on a work site "improper and dangerous" and said that as a former N.R.A. member he was unconcerned about pressure from the organization. The companies involved in the lawsuit say that with about 17 killings a week in American workplaces, it was sound policy and within their rights as property owners to ban weapons from their parking lots. Mr. LaPierre said that "nobody is proposing you be allowed to walk into a nuclear plant with a gun," but that workers had a constitutional right to keep legal weapons secured in their cars when they went to work. The rifle association, which says 90 million Americans own guns, is asking its 4 million members and others not to patronize Conoco or Phillips 66 gas stations. Just last month, it canceled plans to hold its 2007 national convention in Columbus, Ohio, after that city enacted a ban on assault weapons. The dispute in Oklahoma stems from a crackdown at Weyerhaeuser against employee drug abuse. A company spokesman, Bruce Amundson, said trained dogs sniffing in the parking lot of the paper mill in Valliant found a dozen cars with rifles, shotguns, handguns and some automatic weapons, violations of a new policy banning weapons in cars. The gun owners, including contract workers for Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, were fired. Some sued in federal court, claiming in part that the gun policy had not been spelled out. They lost but are appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In response to the firings, Oklahoma lawmakers passed a bill that would bar property owners from restricting those without felony records from keeping firearms in a locked vehicle. But that measure, to take effect in November, has now been blocked by the companies' lawsuit.

Skip to next paragraph Linda Spillers for The New York Times Mark A. Hillman, manager of the Hillman Aggressive Equity fund, says he invested in companies with a "sustainable competitive advantage." Ahead of the Pack Tim Shaffer for The New York Times At the Matthew 25 fund, Mark Mulholland evaluates companies on the quality of their business, management, finances and stock price. Kevin Moloney for The New York Times Scott Schoelzel, the manager of the Janus Twenty fund, was helped by its positions in energy and biotechnology stocks. Managers of three top-performing no-load funds, all of which had concentrated portfolios, talked about some of their stock picks and about the prospects for the stock market. Choosing 17 From 3,500 The $97 million Matthew 25 fund returned 9.7 percent for the quarter. Its manager, Mark Mulholland, 45, says he selects its stocks after evaluating about 3,500 companies of all sizes on the quality of their business, management, finances and stock price. Because the fund holds only 17 stocks, it tends to be more volatile than more diversified portfolios. The minimum investment required for the fund increased to $10,000 from $1,000 on May 1. The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, in Washington, known as Farmer Mac, accounts for about 16 percent of the fund's portfolio. The agency provides rural housing mortgage loans. Its shares rose 26 percent in the quarter. Another winner was Ameritrade Holding, the online broker. It gained 82 percent in the quarter. In early May, Ameritrade received a takeover offer from E*Trade Financial, but declined it. Ameritrade then made a deal to acquire TD Waterhouse USA. Often, prices fall when a company turns down a takeover offer, Mr. Mulholland said. In this case, the stock rose well above the takeover price, demonstrating "good management that did the right thing for shareholders," he said. The fund also made money in Boykin Lodging, a real estate investment trust based in Cleveland that specializes in hotels. Its shares rose 41 percent in the quarter. He said the stock remained undervalued. Looking forward, he said he was very bullish. "It's hard for the market to get legs" while Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is raising interest rates, he said. "But he's going to be done soon and I think the potential that is underlying stocks is very high." Success in Technology The $50 million Hillman Aggressive Equity fund returned 8.5 percent. The manager, Mark A. Hillman, 43, said he focused on "companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage in their industry." Like Matthew 25, this fund, which holds 20 stocks, can be volatile. The fund benefited from its holdings in what Mr. Hillman called "undervalued technology companies." "The investment community came to realize that earnings outlooks for these companies are improving," he said. "A lot of the excesses of the Internet bubble have been worked through the economy, and companies need to begin spending on technology and infrastructure again." One example is Corning, which rose almost 50 percent in the quarter. Mr. Hillman said the company was the most efficient, highest-quality producer of fiber optic cables and flat-panel screens, used in televisions, personal computers and cellphones. It has had problems with its fiber optics division because of a glut in the market, Mr. Hillman said, but demand in that business is increasing. Demand is also rising for its glass-panel displays, he said. Another holding, the mobile phone maker Motorola, was up 22 percent in the quarter. Edward J. Zander, who became the company's chief executive in 2004, "has come in with the right mission - to be the leader in the race to get everything you can on a mobile handset," Mr. Hillman said. The portfolio also succeeded with D. R. Horton Inc., a homebuilder based in Fort Worth. Its shares rose 29 percent. While builders have been out of favor because of fears of rising interest rates, he said, "this company has flourished during plenty of interest rate cycles." Mr. Hillman said he saw "substantial upside" for the overall market this year. "Companies have record levels of cash on their balance sheets, and record earnings," he said, "at the same time that they need to do more capital spending." A Bet on Energy and Biotech Energy and biotechnology stocks drove the returns of the $9.5 billion Janus Twenty fund. This fund is also highly concentrated, owning just 34 stocks, typically those of large and midsize growth companies, said the manager, Scott W. Schoelzel, 46. The fund returned 6.4 percent in the second quarter. It lost 9.5 percent a year, on average, over the five years through June, a legacy of the collapse of the Internet bubble. The fund is closed to new investors. In early 2005, Mr. Schoelzel built a new position in energy shares equal to 20 percent of assets because of climbing demand for energy products and services. ConocoPhillips, the big energy company in Houston, is the fund's biggest position, accounting for more than 5 percent of assets. Its shares rose more than 6 percent, driven largely by rising oil prices, Mr. Schoelzel said. The fund also made money in the Celgene Corporation, a pharmaceutical company in Summit, N.J., that develops cancer drugs and therapies. Its drug Revlimid, proposed as a treatment for blood cancers, received priority review status from the Food and Drug Administration in June, and Mr. Schoelzel expects approval by year-end. Shares rose 19.5 percent in the quarter. Similarly, Genentech, the biotech company based in South San Francisco, Calif., rose almost 42 percent. The F.D.A. recently approved two of the company's drugs: Herceptin, which is used for metastatic breast cancer; and Tarceva, which is used for some lung cancers. For the market in the months ahead, Mr. Schoelzel expects a "high single-digit return environment until the Federal Reserve signals that it's done raising interest rates," he said.

ConocoPhillips's earnings from oil and natural gas sales rose 42 percent to $1.79 billion, and chemicals profit tripled. The company's chief executive, James Mulva, positioned ConocoPhillips to capitalize on the price gains by increasing the company's oil and gas reserves by 8.2 percent last year.

EPCO bought Teppco's general partner for $1.1 billion from Duke Energy Field Services, giving Duke $770 million. EPCO also agreed to buy Duke's limited partnership stake in Teppco for $100 million.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/02place.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Hints of Oil Industry Mergers to Come<date>Published: February 2, 2005</date><text>fter a lull since a wave of mega-mergers in the late 1990's - when Exxon bought Mobil, BP acquired Amoco and Chevron merged with Texaco - the time for large-scale takeovers in the oil industry may again be on the horizon. While high oil prices would make acquisitions more expensive than in the 1990's, when prices were low, oil companies are reporting huge profits. Yet they are also finding it hard to discover new sources of oil. So, the thinking goes, why not spend more money now to buy oil and gas reserves? Advertisement "You'll see deals," said Frederick P. Leuffer, senior energy analyst for Bear, Stearns in New York. Talking about the need to add reserves, he said, "In that sense it's a very simple business: either you find them or you buy them." According to a study by John S. Herold Inc., an independent research firm based in Norwalk, Conn., global oil companies pumped more than 10 billion barrels on average a year in the last five years, but recorded only about 7 billion barrels of reserves. A potential candidate for a takeover is Unocal of El Segundo, Calif. The company - which is most prominent in the Western states - has substantial reserves of both oil and gas, a portfolio of global assets that promises strong growth, and a reputation for underperformance that has discouraged potential investors. That could change. Early in January, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, was reported to be contemplating a $13 billion bid for Unocal. While many analysts view such an offer as unlikely, the speculation could rekindle interest in the sector. "Whether it's Cnooc or someone else is not relevant to me," said Rahan Rashid, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. "What the attention does is let investors reassess the value of Unocal." Unocal's shares have gained nearly 16 percent since Jan. 6, when the Web site of The Financial Times reported the possibility of a Cnooc offer. The stock closed yesterday at $47.76, up 19 cents, and is trading around its highest level in more than 25 years. That is still inexpensive, according to Mr. Rashid, who estimated that Unocal's net asset value - what the company would be worth if it were broken up and sold - would approach $66 a share. Mr. Leuffer of Bear, Stearns puts that value above $50 a share. "The market isn't assigning a better valuation to Unocal," Mr. Rashid said, "because they haven't delivered on execution in the past. That's left a negative taste in people's mouths." Last year, Unocal reduced its goals for production growth twice, citing a slowdown in output in some Indonesian fields and unsuccessful exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. Unocal also had its share of controversies over its operations in Asia. In 1998, the company shelved plans to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, then under the control of the Taliban, after United States aircraft bombed Afghan targets, seeking terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden. More recently, it contested and then agreed to settle lawsuits accusing it in human rights abuses committed by the army of Myanmar, formerly Burma, during construction of a pipeline there in the 1990's. What makes Unocal attractive are a handful of fields in Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico, which are all expected to start producing this year. These projects, if successful, could increase the company's production as much as 10 percent a year through 2010. "That's possibly the best performance among Unocal's peer group," Mr. Rashid said. For oil companies that are struggling to produce growth of 2 percent or 3 percent, that is a strong incentive to take a serious look at Unocal. There have recently been modest signs of a pickup in mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry. Last week, Cimarex Energy, an oil and gas producer based in Denver, agreed to buy Magnum Hunter Resources for $2.1 billion to double its production and, more significantly, triple its reserves. Other recent transactions include Kerr-McGee's agreement to buy Westport Resources for $2.5 billion and the $2.7 billion acquisition of Tom Brown by EnCana of Calgary, Alberta. But none of these came close to the $80 billion Exxon paid for Mobil, the $48 billion BP paid for Amoco and the $27 billion it paid for Atlantic Richfield, or Total's nearly $49 billion purchase of Elf Aquitaine. Despite such lofty numbers, acquisitions are more expensive than in the past, and that is holding potential buyers back. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 energy index gained 29 percent last year, compared with a 9 percent gain for the broad S.&amp; P. 500. (Cimarex shares fell 10 percent after the company announced its deal because investors considered the price too steep.) Unocal has refocused its attention on exploration and production, particularly in North America and Asia, after selling its marketing and refining businesses in the United States. Yesterday, it reported that its fourth-quarter earnings rose almost 50 percent. Income increased to $268 million, or $1 a share, from $180 million, or 68 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 48 percent to $2.35 billion. Unocal's output for the quarter increased almost 2 percent compared with output in the 2003 quarter. The company produces about 155,000 barrels of oil a day and 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas, the equivalent of 272,000 barrels of oil. It has reserves of 1.8 billion barrels of oil and its equivalents, with 62 percent of that natural gas and 38 percent crude oil. "When Unocal was asked about the prospect of a merger in the past," Mr. Leuffer of Bear, Stearns said, "they didn't appear as a willing bride. Today, I think they would entertain a fair offer." The list of potential bidders includes ConocoPhillips, Shell and ChevronTexaco, which have all said that they want to grow in the North American gas and Asian oil markets, Mr. Leuffer said. "That's talking about Unocal without naming it," he said. "If Cnooc, or ENI or Total made a bid, I think other companies would express interest and maybe get a bidding war going."</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/28/politics/28air.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Big Refiner Is Fined and Will Spend $525 Million to Improve Air<date>Published: January 28, 2005</date><text>ASHINGTON, Jan. 27 - The Justice Department announced a settlement on Thursday with the largest oil-refining company in the country over violations of the Clean Air Act. The accord, officials said, will lead to annual reductions of 47,000 tons of harmful emissions. Under the settlement, the refiner, ConocoPhillips of Houston, will pay civil fines of $4.5 million and spend more than $525 million for technological upgrades on nine refineries in seven states to comply with a provision known as new source review. That regulation requires companies to add new pollution controls when they expand their plants. Advertisement The refineries are in California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington. They represent nearly 10 percent of the national refining capacity in the United States. The company is also required to spend an additional $10 million on other environmental projects that reduce emissions. "ConocoPhillips is committed to achieving these significant emissions reductions in conjunction with its ongoing business plans," a spokeswoman, Lara Dilley, said. "These actions will improve environmental performance and support continued safe and reliable operations of the refineries." The agreement is the largest of 13 that the government has negotiated with domestic refineries since the Environmental Protection Agency started enforcing violations of the new source review rule in 1998. The accord brings 55 percent of the refining industry into compliance. Over all, the settlements represent annual reductions of more than 250,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, which forms smog, and sulfur dioxide, which forms soot. The two chemicals harm human health. Although officials at the agency said the accords represented a major success, they also highlight the difficulties in reaching similar agreements with the utility industry, which accounts for most air pollution. All the settlements with refiners over new source review have been achieved without suits. The government has 15 suits against the operators of power plants for what it calls similar violations. It has reached settlements in seven, covering less than 10 percent of the industry. "For whatever reason, when confronted, refineries find it in their interest to settle," the chief enforcement officer of the E.P.A., Thomas V. Skinner, said. "It helped that early on the government got settlements with some of the bigger companies like BP and Koch. Not all came in. But once a couple of leaders reached settlements, it might have changed the dynamic of the industry. "When utilities are confronted, they fight it tooth and nail." A lobbyist for the energy industry, Scott Segal, said utilities were more reluctant to settle suits, in part, because of disagreement with the government over whether upgrading their plants represents routine maintenance, which is not subject to new source review, or expansion, which is. Conceding on one case, Mr. Segal said, would inevitably lead to "a cycle of perpetual regulatory review." "So every time there's the smallest new action," he added, "it would lead to more regulations." Ed Murphy, group director of downstream and industry operations for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, said refiners were willing to settle cases because they had to satisfy changing standards on environmental emissions. Companies are investing $18 billion to accommodate standards for gasoline and diesel that go into effect in 2007, Mr. Murphy said. "If they don't make the changes," he said, "they go out of business."</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/business/businessspecial3/27conoco.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">ConocoPhillips Doubles Profit in 4th Quarter<date>Published: January 27, 2005</date><text>OUSTON, Jan. 26 (AP) - ConocoPhillips said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled because of high oil and gas prices and better refining margins. ConocoPhillips reported net income of $2.43 billion, or $3.44 a share, for the period that ended in December, up from $1.02 billion, or $1.48 a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected $3.07 a share. Revenue for the quarter was $40.1 billion, compared with $26 billion a year earlier. Advertisement For the year, ConocoPhillips reported profit of $8.13 billion, or $11.60 a share, up from $4.74 billion, or $6.91, in 2003. Revenue in 2004 rose to $136.9 billion, from $105.1 billion in 2003. ConocoPhillips shares rose $1.59 yesterday, or 1.8 percent, to $90.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has traded in a 52-week range of $64.62 to $91.22. "Over all, our upstream operations ran well, enabling us to benefit from the strong commodity price environment," James J. Mulva, Conoco's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Results improved in several areas. Exploration and production income from continuing operations was $1.67 billion, up from $991 million in the year-earlier period, primarily because of higher crude oil and natural gas prices, the company said. Refining and marketing income from continuing operations was $753 million, up from $202 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, which ConocoPhillips attributed to higher worldwide margins. John B. Parry, an analyst with John S. Herold, a research firm, said the quarter benefited from the resumption of operations in Alaska and the United Kingdom that had been shuttered for scheduled maintenance in the third quarter. The quarter's net income included $74 million, or 10 cents a share, from the company's 10 percent equity stake in the Russian oil company Lukoil. Mr. Mulva told analysts that ConocoPhillips intended to exercise its right to double its Lukoil stake to 20 percent this year. "I don't see any negatives," Mr. Mulva said of the venture with Lukoil. "This is a decade-to-decade kind of opportunity, but as far as we can see, everything that has developed is very positive for us." Mr. Mulva also told analysts that the company expected to sort out its re-entry into Libya "in the next several months," calling it "an important country for us."</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/business/worldbusiness/25oil.html?ref=conocophillipsinc">Venezuela Tensions Worry Oil Executives<date>Published: January 25, 2005</date><text>OUSTON, Jan. 24 - Venezuela may be increasing tension in energy markets with decisions that are confounding international oil companies, but the government there says it is merely seeking more income and new markets for its oil. Peter J. Hill, chief executive of Harvest Natural Resources of Houston, which gets all its oil from Venezuela, has one view of the policies unfolding there. Harvest's stock lost a quarter of its value last week after the Venezuelan national oil company unexpectedly told it to suspend exploration. ConocoPhillips's plan to develop a new oil field in Venezuela was suspended about two weeks ago, and Rafael Ramírez, the Venezuelan energy minister, said last week that the government would review its 33 operating agreements with oil companies from the 1990's to see if they still made sense for Venezuela. Those delays come as officials, over the last month, have held talks with government-run oil companies from China, Russia and Iran. "I'm a businessman and I don't like to get involved in politics," Mr. Hill, whose company has operated in Venezuela for more than a decade, said in an interview. "But there's been a demonstrable change in the way things are done in Venezuela." The view from Venezuela is different. The government of President Hugo Chávez has said it will negotiate its disputes with Harvest and Conoco to reach agreement on production and spending. But analysts say that at a time of high crude oil prices worldwide and a shift in attention toward China, the Venezuelans are also trying to exert greater control over their resources and expand their range of buyers - as well as get more lucrative deals. Access to some of the most coveted oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere is at stake, with Venezuela exporting about 1.2 million barrels of oil a day to the United States, or nearly 15 percent of American imports. But the overtures to the Chinese, Russians and Iranians have added to worries among private oil companies that Venezuelan policies toward them are becoming increasingly unpredictable. Concern is also rising over the possibility that Venezuela may eventually divert shipments from the United States, which now receives more than half of Venezuela's total production. The Venezuelans say they still consider the United States their principal market, adding that only new production would be moved to China. All this concern has been acutely felt in Houston in recent days. Shares in Harvest, which produces about 30,000 barrels of oil a day in Venezuela, have plunged almost 30 percent since it said that Petróleos de Venezuela, the government-controlled oil company, had told it to effectively cut its production by one-third. "I'm not able to read the mind of the Venezuelan government," said Mr. Hill, who added on Monday that officials from the Venezuelan energy ministry signaled they were open to negotiations on Harvest's activities in the country. He said he did not know why the government oil company "would want to restrict investment and production." "The interface for communication with the government is becoming much cloudier to read," he added. Investors are focusing on the Venezuelan operations of ConocoPhillips, one of the largest international energy companies operating there, after its $480 million plan to develop an oil field off the eastern coast was put on hold this month amid feuding with Petróleos de Venezuela over the project's terms. Conoco gets about 7 percent of its worldwide production from Venezuela. [Dow Jones quoted Mr. Ramírez as saying Monday that the government was close to an agreement with Conoco.] Paul Sankey, a Deutsche Bank analyst, wrote in a note to investors last week that "we are extremely concerned about what seems to be an escalating situation in Venezuela." He recommended reducing holdings of ConocoPhillips shares. Mr. Sankey said American companies in Venezuela, including ConocoPhillips, Harvest and ChevronTexaco were the "main potential losers from the unpredictable situation." Shares of ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, fell more than 3 percent late last week amid greater scrutiny of its differences with Petróleos de Venezuela, and rebounded 1.3 percent on Monday. A spokeswoman declined to comment on its relations with the Venezuelan company. Higher oil prices, which increased the flow of hard currency to Venezuela's treasury, seem to have emboldened the dealings of the leftist Mr. Chávez with foreign energy companies as the rise in oil revenue offset the effects of declining production.

This year, it approved by an overwhelming margin a law allowing employees to keep firearms in locked vehicles on company property, making Oklahoma the envy of pro-gun groups throughout the United States. Advertisement A federal judge here and a group of prominent companies in Oklahoma, however, cannot stomach the mixture. Judge Sven Erik Holmes of United States District Court decided on Tuesday to leave in force a temporary restraining order preventing the law from taking effect, as challenges to it mount from companies including ConocoPhillips and the Williams Companies. The showdown between several of Oklahoma's largest companies and people who want to carry guns began in March, when rural legislators rushed through measures to prevent companies from infringing on what they viewed as an employee's right to keep a gun close at hand at work. Critics of the new law say the dispute could be a test case for similar measures being considered in other states. Paul Viollis, the president of Risk Control Strategies, which assesses security threats for companies, estimates there are already about 17 workplace homicides in the United States each week, with firearms involved in a majority of such incidents. "This is one of the most irresponsible pieces of legislation I've ever heard of," Mr. Viollis said. "What happens with this in Oklahoma carries significance for every state in the country." In fact, an outcry over corporate opposition to the law already appears to have weakened the resolve of at least one company, Whirlpool. The company, which has 1,500 employees at a stove plant in Tulsa, withdrew as lead plaintiff in the case on Tuesday, coincidentally after pro-gun supporters of the law began threatening a boycott of the company's products. "I'll go back to a rub board before I buy a Whirlpool machine ever again," said Jerry Ellis, a Democrat from Valliant who sponsored the bill. Whirlpool insists it dropped out of the case for another reason. It says it received assurances from the state attorney general's office that its current workplace-protection policies prohibiting firearms on its property would not be affected by the new law. Guy Hurst, chief of the litigation section for the attorney general, confirmed on Tuesday that his office did not plan to prosecute companies under the law while the judge's restraining order was in effect. "We've indicated to the companies involved that we're not in the mode to do anything in terms of enforcement at the time being," he said. Even with Whirlpool's exit from the case, many Oklahoma companies still oppose the law. ConocoPhillips and Williams, two of the state's largest energy concerns, took over as lead plaintiffs, supported by several manufacturing companies in Tulsa as well as the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "We're pleased that the restraining order remains in place and that we're able to continue enforcing policies that preserve a safe work environment," said Steven Broussard, a lawyer for ConocoPhillips and Williams. "But we're still worried that this law remains on the books because unfortunately in this day and age bad things happen when guns enter the equation of workplace frustration." Judge Holmes asked lawyers for both sides on Tuesday to present arguments in the next month on whether violation of the law should be considered a criminal or civil offense, an early method of determining whether the case should remain in his court or be transferred to the state level. Mr. Hurst, the lawyer in the state attorney general's office, said a final decision on the case might take as long as two years. In the meantime, supporters of the law are celebrating the attention their measure has received even if it did not take effect this month as expected. The law is an amendment to the state's Firearms and Self-Defense Acts. And it came to pass after Weyerhaeuser, a large paper manufacturer, fired several employees after finding firearms in their automobiles in a company parking lot at its cardboard plant in Valliant in southeastern Oklahoma in 2002. Mr. Ellis, the legislator from Valliant and an employee who worked at Weyerhaeuser for 30 years, said he believed that the company improperly used its safety policies as a way to cut costs by firing employees. He was elected to the Legislature two years ago, around the same time he was retiring from Weyerhaeuser, and said he decided to write the bill with the help of a pro-gun lawyer in Tulsa, Lawrence Johnson. Weyerhaeuser, for its part, said it had alerted employees two years ago that searches of the company parking lot in Valliant would be conducted with dogs, after it discovered employees with drug problems. The drug-sniffing dogs, also trained to uncover firearms, found guns in the cars of four employees and nine contractors, all of whom were fired, according to Frank Mendizabal, a spokesman for Weyerhaeuser at its headquarters in Federal Way, Wash.</text></article></page></root>
