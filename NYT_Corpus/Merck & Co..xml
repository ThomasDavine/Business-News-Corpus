After a thorough review of the evidence, an influential federal advisory committee recommended that boys ages 11 and 12 should routinely be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, echoing a 2006 recommendation for vaccinating girls of that age.The main concern about the virus remains what it always was — it can cause cervical cancer in women. But now we know that it is also associated with cancers of the vulva and vagina in women, the penis in men, and anal and throat cancers in both men and women. All told, the virus is linked to 18,000 cancers each year among women in the United States and 7,000 among men. It is also associated with most cases of genital warts. Conservative politicians have railed against the vaccine and the efforts by some states to require it. Many parents are appalled at the notion of vaccinating youngsters against a sexually transmitted virus before most have even begun to think about sex. The reason for starting early is clear: the immune response is strong then and the vaccine is most effective before exposure to the virus. If that window is missed, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said the vaccine should still be given routinely to women up to age 26 and men up to age 21. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to adopt the recommendations soon. Vaccination rates among teenage girls have been disappointing; only a third have received all three recommended doses. Federal officials expect the rate among young boys will be even lower. The only vaccine approved for boys — Merck’s Gardasil — is expensive. It typically costs $390 for all three doses. A public insurance program pays for poor and uninsured children, and Merck has assistance programs. But, as Gardiner Harris reported in The Times, vaccinating the nation’s 11- and 12-year-old boys could cost almost $140 million a year and a one-time catch-up to vaccinate boys 13 to 21 would cost hundreds of millions more, with the government paying half the bill. The advisory panel concluded that the vaccinations would be cost effective because they would reduce the burden of illness in the future. Public health officials should focus on increasing vaccination rates.</text></article>

Rick Perry’s rivals for the Republican presidential nomination have been pummeling him for his attempt to require sixth-grade girls in Texas to be vaccinated against a sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer. The attacks are absurd.At last week’s G.O.P. debate, Rick Santorum accused him of promoting “big government run amok.” A fund-raising video for Ron Paul shows a caricature of Mr. Perry swaying with joy and squeezing a syringe as he “forced young girls in Texas to be injected with an S.T.D. vaccine.” Michele Bachmann called it “flat out wrong” to have “innocent little 12-year-old girls be forced to have a government injection through an executive order.” She followed up with interviews asserting that the vaccine could have “very dangerous side effects” and could cause mental retardation, based on what a woman supposedly told her. Mr. Perry made the right call to protect the health of vulnerable youngsters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend the vaccine for young girls and attest to its safety based on 35 million doses administered with few serious side effects. The governor’s motivations may not have been as high-minded as he claimed. Merck, the vaccine’s manufacturer, had donated to his campaigns and stood to make millions if its vaccine were required. We are also seriously concerned that his rivals’ uninformed attacks might lead many parents to shun this vaccine and others, putting children at risk. Mr. Perry issued an executive order in 2007 requiring that all girls entering the sixth grade be vaccinated against strains of the human papilloma virus that cause 70 percent of all cases of cervical cancer and 90 percent of all cases of genital warts. The HPV vaccines are most effective if given at that early age, when they produce the best immune response and can work before a girl becomes sexually active. His order allowed parents to opt out for reasons of conscience or to preserve parental rights. But conservatives complained about governmental overreach and charged that it would encourage girls to become promiscuous. The Legislature overturned his order, and Mr. Perry, unfortunately, has not pursued it since. At the debate, the governor said he had tried to err on the side of saving lives but acknowledged mistakes in how he handled it. If he had it to do over, he said, he would have sought legislative approval (which means it wouldn’t have happened) or let parents opt in (which would make it a voluntary program) instead of making them opt out. Where he really stands today is hard to discern. There is a legitimate question about whether his executive order was an effort to reward a donor, another point raised at the debate by Ms. Bachmann. Merck has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to his campaigns and even more to the Republican Governors Association, which has supported his campaigns. Merck also hired Mr. Perry’s former chief of staff to lobby in Austin on behalf of the HPV vaccine and other matters. If his rivals want to do a real public service, they should dig deeper into whether he has put his office at the disposal of deep-pocketed donors.</text></article>

Afghan violence. Economic indicators. Show some appreciation. Bachmann is a challenge for feminist-friendly voters. Was it sexist to talk about her migraine problem? For Newsweek to run the cover that made her look like a well-groomed zombie? Should we have applauded the Iowa Republicans when they put a woman at the top of their presidential preference list, even if the woman in question blamed government spending for the earthquake in Washington? Wow, it seems like we went through all this with Sarah Palin yesterday. Women tend to do well in almost any new enterprise where there’s not a lot of stratification and seniority. So it’s not surprising the Tea Party has a number of female stars. But isn’t it sort of strange that they’re all extremely attractive to the point of hot? You’d think there’d be a gray hair or a wattle somewhere. As we’ve all learned, Bachmann’s strong points are her passion and determination, while her weak ones include a rather free-floating relationship with reality. This week, she scored a Tea Party version of a home run when she laced into Rick Perry for trying to require girls in Texas public schools to be vaccinated against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer. “I’m a mom, and I’m a mom of three children,” she said, neglecting for what may have been the first time in the campaign to mention that she also fostered 23 others. Let’s stop a minute on the mom point. How often should a female candidate with children bring that up? My suggestion would be: frequently enough that we can appreciate a special sympathy for issues like early childhood education. But not so often that you could imagine it being her first comment during negotiations with North Korea over plutonium processing. Except that Michele Bachmann does not seem to have a special sympathy for early childhood education. So forget it. About the vaccine. It’s been proved to be effective in reducing cervical cancer in sexually active women, and it apparently works best if you begin the shots around age 12. The intense opposition from the social right appears to be based on the idea that once the kids had the shots they’d be more likely to have sex. Or, in the convoluted and creepy words of Rick Santorum: “Unless Texas has a very progressive way of communicating diseases in their school by way of their curriculum, then there is no government purpose served for having little girls inoculated at the force and compulsion of the government.” Then, Bachmann tossed in another argument: vaccines are dangerous. “I had a mother last night come up to me ... she told me her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter,” Bachmann told one TV interviewer after another. O.K., hold the phone. Let’s presume that Bachmann is being accurate, and that the woman in question was not someone she heard about from a friend of a friend’s cousin in Xenia, Ohio. What would you expect a candidate for president of the United States to do after such an encounter? Take a name? Investigate the case? Would a contender for the White House — or even the Zoning Board of Appeals — just blurt out something they heard from a stranger that could discourage parents from accepting vaccinations that could save their children’s lives? The Bachmann campaign did not respond to my questions about who the woman was or what the candidate did to check out the information. So I guess maybe, yeah. Before we bid adieu to Michele Bachmann, let’s look at her other charge against Perry: that the governor tried to start up a vaccination program because he got campaign contributions from the vaccine’s maker, Merck. “If you’re saying that I can be bought for five thousand, I’m offended,” said Perry, in a response that will make a swell campaign ad. (“Vote for the Man Who Can’t Be Bought for as Little as $5,000!”) Although Merck has apparently donated about $30,000. And at the time Perry made the decision, his former chief of staff was working for Merck as a lobbyist. Rick Perry supports abstinence-only sex education in all Texas public schools. He doesn’t think kids should be taught about condoms. How many of you really think he would leap to the cutting-edge front of the war against sexually transmitted disease by inoculating 12-year-old girls simply because, as he put it, “I am always going to err on the side of life.” Let me see a show of hands. Sooner or later, even Michele Bachmann will turn out to be right about something.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/us/politics/republican-candidates-battle-over-hpv-vaccine.html?ref=merckandcompany">Rick Perry Under Fire by Republican Rivals for Requiring HPV Vaccine for Girls<date>Published: September 13, 2011</date><text>An unlikely issue — whether to vaccinate preadolescent girls against a sexually transmitted virus — has become the latest flashpoint among Republican presidential candidates as they vie for the support of social conservatives and Tea Party members.The issue exploded Monday night when Representative Michele Bachmann and former Senator Rick Santorum attacked Gov. Rick Perry of Texas during a debate for issuing an executive order requiring sixth-grade girls to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus, criticizing the order as an overreach of state power in a decision properly left to parents. Later, Sarah Palin, who has yet to announce her 2012 intentions, also found fault with Mr. Perry. The issue pushes many buttons with conservatives: overreach of government in health care decisions, suspicion that sex education leads to promiscuity and even the belief — debunked by science — that childhood vaccinations may be linked to mental disorders. On Tuesday, Mrs. Bachmann, of Minnesota, raised that concern by suggesting that Mr. Perry had put young girls at risk by forcing “an injection of what could potentially be a very dangerous drug.” Appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, she recounted that after the debate in Tampa, Fla., a tearful mother approached and said her daughter had suffered “mental retardation” after being vaccinated against HPV. “It can have very dangerous side effects,” Mrs. Bachmann said. The focus on Mr. Perry’s record on the issue put him on the defensive during a debate for the second week in a row, this time among his core constituency of Tea Party voters. “It’s the perfect storm of an issue,” said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa, noting that Mr. Perry, the front-runner in recent polls, was being attacked from his right flank. “You could tell these blows landed and affected him.” Although Mrs. Bachmann called the HPV vaccine dangerous, a report last month from the Institute of Medicine, which advises the government, found that it was generally safe. There is no evidence linking it to mental retardation. The vaccine is strongly recommended by medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Cancer Society, to prevent cervical cancer, which kills about 4,000 women in the United States annually. The recommended age of vaccination for girls is 11 or 12, before they become sexually active. But only Virginia and the District of Columbia require vaccination for middle school entry, according to the cancer society. Dr. Deborah Saslow, the cancer society’s director of breast and gynecological cancer, said it did not advocate requiring HPV vaccinations before entering middle school, since parents and even doctors need more time to get used to the idea of the vaccine and to accept that it is safe. When Mr. Perry issued his executive order in 2007, he made Texas the first state to require vaccinations, although parents could opt out. The order was instantly controversial — the State Legislature overturned it by bipartisan majorities before it could be carried out — and criticisms were raised at the time that Mr. Perry was doing a favor for a former chief of staff, Mike Toomey, who was then a lobbyist for Merck, the maker of the first HPV vaccine on the market, Gardasil. Merck was lobbying legislatures around the country at the time to require Gardasil for middle school girls, but amid criticism — led by conservative groups worried that it would promote early sex — the company withdrew the campaign. Mrs. Bachmann, whose campaign had lost the wind in its sails ever since Mr. Perry entered the nomination race last month, used Monday night’s debate to accuse the governor of what she later called “crony capitalism” because of his ties to Mr. Toomey and Merck, which donated to his campaign. Ms. Palin echoed those charges on Fox News. Mr. Perry, who said during the debate that he should have worked with the Texas Legislature, not issued an executive fiat, dismissed any suggestion that he could be bought for a mere $5,000 contribution (records show he actually received $30,000 from Merck). A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Mark Miner, called Mrs. Bachmann’s and others’ comments “ridiculous.” “You’re going to have candidates grasping for straws and grasping to get attention,” Mr. Miner said. “However, Governor Perry will continue focusing on issues that matter to people such as creating jobs and improving the economy.” Mrs. Bachmann said she would continue to raise the vaccine issue because it shows “very real distinctions” between herself and Mr. Perry. Republican strategists also said that the issue was unlikely to go away, and that Mr. Perry’s actions in 2007 raised questions not only among social conservatives, but also with party members and independents who would find it an overreach of executive authority. “I think it undercuts Governor Perry’s ability to criticize Governor Romney on health care,” said Steve Duprey, the Republican national committeeman for New Hampshire, referring to Mr. Romney’s support of an individual mandate in Massachusetts. “We’re a state that takes a dim view on the government compelling us to do anything.” Mrs. Bachmann’s suggestion that HPV vaccines could be dangerous caused some influential conservative bloggers and broadcasters to suggest that she had carried the attack too far, raising questions about her judgment in echoing the thoroughly debunked views that vaccines are linked to autism or other mental illness. Rush Limbaugh on Tuesday said she “may have jumped the shark” with her linking of HPV vaccines to mental retardation. Appearing on the talk show of another conservative host, Sean Hannity, Mrs. Bachmann backpedaled a bit. “I am not a doctor, I am not a scientist, I’m not a physician,” she said.</text></article>

Rick Perry of Texas, the man who signed the 2007 order -– a move he later withdrew and was forced to defend at the Republican debate on Monday night. “I knew even at that time something was up with that issue,” Ms. Palin said on Fox News after the debate, noting that Mr. Perry’s former chief of staff had ties to Merck, the company that manufactures the Gardasil vaccine. “And now we’re finding out, yeah, something was up with that issue. It was an illustration or a bit of evidence of some crony capitalism.” All three politicians – Ms. Palin, Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Perry – would need to rely on both social conservatives and Tea Party activists to win the G.O.P. nomination. So it’s not hard to see why the issue is proving appealing fodder for the two women. They can use it to undermine Mr. Perry’s credibility with social conservatives by noting that he would have required girls under 12 to be inoculated against the virus that causes cervical cancer, which is generally transmitted sexually. And the argument that his move was influenced by donations and ties to lobbyists appeals to Tea Party supporters skeptical of government authority and backroom political dealing. When Ms. Palin first used the term “crony capitalism” in a speech in Iowa this month to describe generally the process by which lawmakers become wealthy by using taxpayer dollars to benefit corporations and donors, she would not say whether her comments were directed at Mr. Perry. In fact, up to this point, Ms. Palin had resisted directly criticizing Mr. Perry. Last year, she campaigned for Mr. Perry as he fought back a challenge from Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Republican primary for governor. In January 2010, she posted a note on Facebook saying she looked forward to supporting him and other candidates “so they can continue to fight for our American values.” (The other two she mentioned by name, by the way, were Senator John McCain and Mrs. Bachmann.) During that race Ms. Palin said Mr. Perry “walks the walk of a true conservative,” and the two are thought to have a cordial relationship off the campaign trail. Up to this point in the Republican race, Ms. Palin has called Mr. Perry a “fine candidate” and defended him after he called the policies of the Federal Reserve shairman, Ben S. Bernanke, “treasonous,” saying that Mr. Perry was “voicing great concerns that many of us share.” And during a recent trip to Iowa, when asked to contrast their records as governor, Ms. Palin declined, noting that Texas has a weak executive office. “That doesn’t mean he’s doing a better job or worse job than any other governor, including myself,” said Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska. Mrs. Bachmann is taking the “crony capitalist” line and running with it. We’re still waiting to see whether Ms. Palin lets Mrs. Bachmann continue to be the sole beneficiary, or if she’ll start using the phrase in her own campaign.</text></article>

Rick Perry in their fight for the Republican presidential nomination — the vaccination of young girls against a sexually transmitted virus. In Monday night’s debate, Mrs. Bachmann seized on an executive order that Mr. Perry issued requiring sixth-grade girls in Texas to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, criticizing him for an overreach of state power in a decision properly left to parents. On Tuesday she expanded her criticism, suggesting that Mr. Perry had potentially put young girls at risk by forcing “an injection of what could potentially be a very dangerous drug.’’ Mrs. Bachmann said on NBC’s “Today” show on Tuesday that after Monday night’s debate in Tampa, Fla., a tearful mother approached her and said her daughter had suffered “mental retardation” after being vaccinated against HPV. “It can have very dangerous side effects,’’ Mrs. Bachmann said. With her statements, Mrs. Bachmann thrust herself into an issue that pushes many buttons with social conservatives: abuse of executive authority, suspicion that sex education leads to promiscuity and the belief — debunked by science — that childhood vaccinations cause mental disorders. The issue shows the candidates’ balancing medical science and the role of government with personal liberty, which has echoes in whether the government can require individuals to buy health insurance. Mrs. Bachmann said she would continue to raise the vaccine issue because it showed “very real distinctions” between herself and Mr. Perry, including over what she called “crony capitalism,’’ an allusion to the fact Mr. Perry’s former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Merck, the maker of Gardasil, an anti-HPV vaccine, which contributed to his campaigns. Mr. Perry on Monday night said it was nonsense to suggest that he could be bought for a donation of $5,000, and he said his 2007 executive order — overturned by the Legislature and never put into practice — was motivated by concern over the devastation of cervical cancer. If he had it to do over, he said, he would have worked with Texas lawmakers, not issued an executive order. At least 20 states have passed laws to require, finance or educate the public about the HPV vaccine, but only Virginia and the District of Columbia mandate vaccination for middle school entry, according to the American Cancer Society. Two drugs, Gardasil and Cervarix, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for HPV, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends all girls 11 to 12 be vaccinated, before they are sexually active. The vaccinations have been the target of heated opposition, primarily among conservatives, since Gardasil entered the market in 2006.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/business/fda-panels-back-sterner-language-on-bone-drugs.html?ref=merckandcompany">F.D.A. Panels Back Sterner Language on Bone Drugs<date>Published: September 9, 2011</date><text>Two advisory panels to the Food and Drug Administration on Friday recommended increasing the cautionary language on the product labels of bone-building drugs taken by more than five million women in the United States.But they stopped short of specifying what the safety warnings should say and did not recommend limiting use of the drugs to a proposed five years. About 11 percent of women 55 and older take the drugs to prevent bone fractures. The medical advisers did not press the issue as strongly as the F.D.A. staff itself did in a 45-page report issued on Wednesday. The staff report said studies “suggest no significant advantage of continuing drug therapy beyond five years.” The F.D.A. is expected to issue a revised label in November for the drugs, known as bisphosphonates, including Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva. The agency usually follows the advice of its advisory panels, but not always. The two panels met jointly on Friday to comment on the staff’s broad safety review of the drugs, prompted by concerns over a relatively small number of long-term users who had suffered unusual thigh fractures or a serious jaw disease. The benefits of the drugs have only been proven for three to five years, not longer, F.D.A. staff members said, warning about links to those rare conditions after longer use. The advisory meeting ended in a 17-6 vote on a single question put to the panel for a vote: whether the labels should “further clarify the duration of use” of the drugs. Several advisers said the question was vague. So are the current labels, which say, “The optimal duration of use has not been determined.” The F.D.A. said an estimated 9 percent of users take the drugs longer than three years, and under 1 percent take them longer than five years. But none of the panel members recommended firm restrictions on longer-term use. None suggested a so-called black box warning, as some former patients who suffered the injuries are seeking. Dr. Lewis S. Nelson, a toxicologist with the New York University School of Medicine, said the evidence warranted “something a little bit more dramatic,” like moving the statement to the “warnings” section of the label from the section on “indications and usage.” Others said few patients heeded the label, anyway. They suggested stronger language asking doctors to review the usage annually. Dr. Nelson is chairman of the F.D.A. Drug Safety and Risk Management Committee; it joined the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs in the daylong review. Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, a professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine, who voted for the new label, opposed a tougher warning for people to stop taking the drugs. “I wouldn’t put a limit of five years for therapy because that would handcuff a lot of doctors,” he said. Several advisers said the new label needed to be much more specific about benefits during the first three to five years and about the uncertainties after that. They said doctors and patients should consider a variety of factors while individually considering longer-term use of the drug. The six people who voted against a label change said there was insufficient evidence of risk in longer use, especially with a drug proven to benefit women for the first three to five years. “I don’t want to cry wolf on this,” said Dr. John M. Kittelson, a professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics at the University of Colorado Denver. Several women who have suffered the unusual fractures testified at the meeting. Dr. Jennifer P. Schneider, whose thigh broke as she was standing in a New York subway, presented her own review of 111 cases. Almost all took the drug for more than five years, most for a pre-osteoporosis condition called osteopenia, she said. Many felt pain in the thigh before the bone suddenly broke. The first such drug, Fosamax, was marketed by Merck in 1995. Others include Actonel and Atelvia from Warner Chilcott and Boniva from Roche Therapeutics. Worldwide sales last year were $7.6 billion. The committee also called for more study of the overall effectiveness of the drugs in their desired goal of preventing fractures. And the advisers recommended that the F.D.A. take a close look at why the drugs are prescribed as preventive medicine for women who do not even have osteoporosis.</text></article>

Staff: 5 Years May Be Enough for Bone Drugs<date>September 7, 2011, 2:52 pm</date><text>Most women who take bone-building drugs like Fosamax can safely stop taking them after five years, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday in a staff report leading up to a broad safety review scheduled Friday by two scientific advisory committees. Studies show that the drugs do have proven benefits in preventing osteoporosis fractures for the first three years of treatment, but continuing beyond five years does not demonstrate such benefits over no drug use at all, the report said. And women who stop taking the drugs after five years have similar levels of increased bone density and reduced fracture risk as those who continue taking them, it said. “These results suggest no significant advantage of continuing drug therapy beyond 5 years,” according to agency’s 45-page review of scientific evidence. As for side effects, the report said, there is no solid evidence the drugs, called bisphosphonates, cause unusual breaks of the femur bone, a jaw injury called osteonecrosis, or esophageal cancer. At the same time, the agency said, those rare but dangerous outcomes cannot be ruled out because it has been so difficult to study them for various reasons. “The safety of long-term bisphosphonate therapy continues to be unclear as study results are conflicting,” according to the F.D.A. report. The drugs under review include Fosamax from Merck, first approved in 1995, Boniva from Roche Therapeutics, Actonel and Atelvia from Warner Chilcott, and generic copies. The F.D.A. has never conducted a broad review of the long-term safety and efficacy of the drugs. A so-called “drug holiday” may be warranted for many of the women who take the drugs for longer terms, the report said, but adding a note of caution: “There are no substantial data available to inform decisions regarding the initiation or duration of a drug holiday.” Between 5.1 million and 5.7 million patients in the United States have received prescriptions for the drugs for each of the years 2005 through 2009, the agency said, citing drug tracking from the data firm SDI. Most patients were over 55 years old. At least one in 11 women in that age group received the bone drugs, the agency said. Sally Fullman, 69, of Murray Hill, N.J., started taking Fosamax in 2006 after being diagnosed with osteoporosis. She stopped taking it last year partly because of concern about the possible side effects. “I’m troubled by all the confusion and the stress that’s out there with respect to the advisability of taking them,” Ms. Fullman said in an interview shortly before the F.D.A. issued its report. “I’m still on a drug holiday. But when I talk to people, everybody is confused and angry about this.” Perhaps the F.D.A. safety review will help patients like Ms. Fullman – at least more than media reports on conflicting studies, anecdotal cases and lawsuits. “When I read articles or see things on TV, what I hear are side effects that are taken out of context,” she said. “So they’re catchy and they kind of scare you a little bit, but they don’t really tell you the risks of not taking the medication.” Drug makers including Merck issued their own safety reports on Wednesday at the F.D.A.’s request. The Merck report, using the chemical name for Fosamax, said: “The available data support a favorable benefit to risk profile during long-term (10-year) treatment with alendronate in osteoporotic patients who remain at risk of osteoporotic fracture and who have not experienced adverse reactions that required discontinuation of therapy.” But Merck also said it would support the notion of taking a break from the bone drugs. “A drug holiday may be considered for patients who have previously received long-term treatment and are no longer considered to have a sufficiently high fracture risk,” the company said.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/opinion/useless-pharmaceutical-studies-real-harm.html?ref=merckandcompany">Useless Pharmaceutical Studies, Real Harm<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>Minneapolis LAST month, the Archives of Internal Medicine published a scathing reassessment of a 12-year-old research study of Neurontin, a seizure drug made by Pfizer. The study, which had included more than 2,700 subjects and was carried out by Parke-Davis (now part of Pfizer), was notable for how poorly it was conducted. The investigators were inexperienced and untrained, and the design of the study was so flawed it generated few if any useful conclusions. Even more alarming, 11 patients in the study died and 73 more experienced “serious adverse events.” Yet there have been few headlines, no demands for sanctions or apologies, no national bioethics commissions pledging to investigate. Why not? One reason is that the study was not quite what it seemed. It looked like a clinical trial, but as litigation documents have shown, it was actually a marketing device known as a “seeding trial.” The purpose of seeding trials is not to advance research but to make doctors familiar with a new drug. In a typical seeding trial, a pharmaceutical company will identify several hundred doctors and invite them to take part in a research study. Often the doctors are paid for each subject they recruit. As the trial proceeds, the doctors gradually get to know the drug, making them more likely to prescribe it later. In an age of for-profit clinical research, this is the new face of scandal. Pharmaceutical companies promote their drugs with pseudo-studies that have little if any scientific merit, and patients naïvely sign up, unaware of the ways in which they are being used. Nobody really knows how often companies conduct such trials, but they appear with alarming regularity in pharmaceutical marketing documents. In the marketing plan for the antidepressant Lexapro for the 2004 fiscal year, Forest Laboratories described 102 Phase IV trials — the classification under which seeding trials fall — in a section labeled “Marketing Tactics.” Oversight bodies like the Food and Drug Administration generally don’t view seeding trials as research scandals: seeding trials are not illegal, and the drugs in question have already received F.D.A. approval. But even after particularly egregious seeding trials have been exposed, the F.D.A. has not issued sanctions. Take the notorious Advantage study, a seeding trial of the pain reliever Vioxx conducted by Merck. According to a 2008 report in the Annals of Internal Medicine, litigation documents show that the Advantage study was conceived and managed by Merck’s marketing department. Three subjects died in the Advantage trial; five more subjects experienced heart attacks. Oversight bodies should treat the Advantage study as a violation of research ethics. How can studies that endanger human subjects attract so little scrutiny? Forty years ago, when most clinical research took place in academic settings, the main dangers to research subjects came in service to genuine scientific aims. A large regulatory apparatus was developed to protect human subjects from the ambitions of overweening academic researchers. In the early 1990s, however, pharmaceutical companies realized that it was faster and less expensive to conduct trials in the private sector, where the driving force is not knowledge, but profit. And the regulatory apparatus designed for the old era has proved woefully inadequate for the new one. The main source of protection for research subjects is a patchwork system of ethics committees known as institutional review boards, or I.R.B.’s. These are small, federally empowered bodies that review research proposals before they are carried out, to ensure that the studies are ethically sound. But they don’t typically pass judgment on whether a study is being carried out merely to market a drug. Nor do most I.R.B.’s have the requisite expertise to do so. Even worse, many I.R.B.’s are now themselves for-profit businesses, paid directly by the sponsors of the studies they evaluate. If one I.R.B. gets a reputation for being too strict, a pharmaceutical company can simply go elsewhere for its review. Last week, the federal government announced that it was overhauling its rules governing the protection of human subjects. But the new rules would not stop seeding trials. It is time to admit that I.R.B.’s are simply incapable of overseeing a global, multibillion-dollar corporate enterprise. They should be replaced with an oversight system that is financially and administratively independent of the research it oversees. The system must have the power to impose sanctions, and its responsibilities must extend to fraud, bribery and corruption. Many patients volunteer for research in the hope that the knowledge generated will benefit others. When a company deceives them into volunteering for a useless study, it cynically exploits their good will, undermining the cause of legitimate research everywhere.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/business/20tax.html?ref=merckandcompany">U.S. Companies Press for Repatriation Holiday<date>Published: June 19, 2011</date><text>Some of the nation’s largest corporations have amassed vast profits outside the country and are pressing Congress and the Obama administration for a tax break to bring the money home.Apple has $12 billion waiting offshore, Google has $17 billion and Microsoft, $29 billion. Under the proposal, known as a repatriation holiday, the federal income tax owed on such profits returned to the United States would fall to 5.25 percent for one year, from 35 percent. In the short term, the measure could generate tens of billions in tax revenues as companies transfer money that would otherwise remain abroad, and it could help ease the huge budget deficit. Corporations and their lobbyists say the tax break could resuscitate the gasping recovery by inducing multinational corporations to inject $1 trillion or more into the economy, and they promoted the proposal as “the next stimulus” at a conference last Wednesday in Washington. “For every billion dollars that we invest, that creates 15,000 to 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly,” Jim Rogers, the chief of Duke Energy, said at the conference. Duke has $1.3 billion in profits overseas. But that’s not how it worked last time. Congress and the Bush administration offered companies a similar tax incentive, in 2005, in hopes of spurring domestic hiring and investment, and 800 took advantage. Though the tax break lured them into bringing $312 billion back to the United States, 92 percent of that money was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, according to a study by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research. This money comes from overseas operations and in some cases accounting maneuvers that shift domestic profits to low-tax countries. The study concluded that the program “did not increase domestic investment, employment or research and development.” Indeed, 60 percent of the benefits went to just 15 of the largest United States multinational companies — many of which laid off domestic workers, closed plants and shifted even more of their profits and resources abroad in hopes of cashing in on the next repatriation holiday. Merck, the pharmaceutical giant based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., was one of those big winners. The company brought home $15.9 billion, second overall to Pfizer’s $37 billion. It used the money for “U.S.-based research and development spending, capital investments in U.S. plants, and salaries and wages for the U.S.,” a Merck spokesman, Steven Campanini, said last week. According to regulatory filings, though, the company cut its work force and capital spending in this country in the three years that followed. Merck used the cash infusion to continue paying dividends and buying back stock for the benefit of shareholders and executives — even as it was rocked by more than $8 billion in costs to settle a variety of disputes after executive missteps. Merck had to pay billions in back taxes to the I.R.S.; billions more to consumers suing because of the dangerous side effects of the painkiller Vioxx, and hundreds of millions to the Justice Department, which had accused the company of defrauding Medicare. The tax break, part of the American Jobs Creation Act, lacked safeguards to ensure the companies used the money for investment and job creation in the United States, as Congress intended. “There were no direct tracing requirements,” said Jay B. Schwartz, head of Merck’s international tax unit until 2006. “So once the money came home, it gave you great flexibility.” Finding Work-Arounds Although the law forbade the use of repatriated funds directly for executive compensation or stock buybacks, companies found plenty of ways around it. “Fungibility is one of my favorite words,” Mr. Schwartz said. As Congress was debating the tax cut in 2004, senior executives at Merck anxiously followed the battle through Congress. Some company officials were worried that the costs of the Vioxx lawsuits might top $10 billion and push the company to the brink of bankruptcy, Mr. Schwartz said. When the measure was finally signed into law by President George W. Bush in October 2004, “there was a lot of excitement, a lot of cheering,” among senior management, he said. Merck executives declined to comment. Merck brought back $15.9 billion in October 2005. The next month, it unveiled a restructuring plan to cut 7,000 jobs. Over the next three years, about half those cuts were made in the United States, where the company’s employment fell to 28,800 jobs, from 31,500. How big the job cuts would have been without the tax break is unknown, though Mr. Schwartz said contingency plans called for painful reductions throughout the company. That restructuring was harsh in places like Albany, Ga., one of the nation’s poorest communities, where Merck closed its Flint River manufacturing plant and shed more than 400 workers. “It was like going through a sudden divorce,” said Connie McKissack, now 45, who had worked at the company for a dozen years as a systems analyst. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Issues Safety Alert on Zocor<date>June 8, 2011, 3:58 pm</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday announced new safety restrictions on high-dose simvastatin, also known as Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug taken by an estimated 2.1 million Americans. The agency said the 80-milligram dose caused a potentially severe muscle disease, called myopathy, especially in the first year of taking the medication. No new patients should be put on the high dosage, the F.D.A. said, recommending that existing patients should continue only if they have used the drug for more than a year without experiencing muscle pains. Alternative statins may be safer, the agency said. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, advised patients on Wednesday to talk to their doctors if they wanted to change their statin drug or dosage. The company said many patients would not be affected by the F.D.A. action because they were taking lower dosages or had not felt muscle pain. The F.D.A. approved 80-milligram Zocor in 1998, seven years after it approved lower dosages of the drug. It was once Merck’s top-selling product. Since the patent expired in 2006, simvastatin has mostly been sold as a generic drug. The new restriction also applies to Vytorin, a combination drug sold by Merck and Schering-Plough that has some formulations in the 80-milligram dose. And the restriction applies to Simcor, a combination pill sold by Abbott Laboratories. Simcor has lower levels of simvastatin, but may cause higher levels in the body interacting with other drugs, like blood pressure medicines amlodipine and diltiazem. “I think this is overdue,” said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “Most experts in the field have known for many years that these high doses of Zocor were not safe compared with the other statins.” Two other statins are more potent and can accomplish the same cholesterol targets at lower doses, he said, citing Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor. Some doctors have prescribed simvastatin because it is cheaper in generic form. Lipitor goes off patent in November. Muscle aches have long been known as a possible side effect of statins. The F.D.A. issued a safety warning on high-dose simvastatin in March 2010. On Wednesday, it said a seven-year study and patient reports prove that patients taking the higher dosage have a higher risk of muscle injury than those taking a lower dose of the drug or taking other statins. The high doses accounted for 11.7 percent of 94 million simvastatin prescriptions in the United States last year and 15.5 percent of 8.6 million Vytorin prescriptions, the industry research firm IMS Health said. Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, chief medical officer for Merck, said the higher dose was developed to address medical thinking that the lower a patient’s cholesterol level, the better. “Whatever we did was good enough for the F.D.A., and this is a very important concept in the field,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “Many people who take simvastatin will not be affected by these label updates,” Dr. Rosenblatt added in a statement. “We encourage those who think these changes might affect them to talk to their doctor.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/business/24drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">Vertex’s Incivek Approved by F.D.A. for Hepatitis C<date>Published: May 23, 2011</date><text>Vertex Pharmaceuticals won regulatory approval on Monday for a new hepatitis C drug, setting off a marketing battle with Merck over new drugs that are expected to improve the cure rate of the disease and shorten the duration of treatment.Incivek, as the drug will be called, is expected to be the first big product for Vertex, and the first it will sell on its own. It is expected to allow the company to finally become profitable after 22 years in business and an expenditure of $4 billion. Merck’s drug, Victrelis, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on May 13. The drugs “represent a new direction in the treatment of hepatitis C and a significant improvement over the current standard of care,” Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the commissioner of the F.D.A., said in a conference call on Monday. Both products borrow from the strategy used by H.I.V. drugs of inhibiting the action of a viral enzyme — in this case, the hepatitis C protease enzyme. In a clinical trial, 79 percent of people treated with Incivek combined with the existing treatment achieved what is effectively considered a cure, compared with 46 percent for those getting the existing drugs alone. About half the patients treated with Incivek were able to finish treatment in 24 weeks instead of the usual 48 weeks. That is considered important because treatment, which involves the existing drugs alpha interferon and ribavirin, is arduous. Side effects can include flulike symptoms, anemia and depression. Incivek has its own side effects, particularly a severe rash. It can also worsen anemia and cause nausea, fatigue and hemorrhoids. Most analysts expect Vertex’s drug to reach annual sales of $2 billion within three years and to outsell Merck’s drug because it appears to be somewhat more effective in clinical trials, though the two drugs were never compared head to head. Also, the treatment using Vertex’s drug is less complex and requires six pills a day, half as many as required for Merck’s drug. Vertex set the wholesale price of Incivek, also known as telaprevir, at $49,200 for the entire course of treatment. Merck’s Victrelis, also known as boceprevir, costs $26,400 to $48,400 depending on the duration of treatment. Both drugs would be used in addition to the standard therapy, which costs about $15,000 to $30,000 depending on duration. Vertex executives defended the price, saying that cures can prevent the problems that can be caused by hepatitis C, like liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and the need for a liver transplant. “Cure is rare in medicine and that makes the economics very compelling,” said Joshua Boger, who founded Vertex. He stepped down as chief executive two years ago, but is still a director. The new drugs could appeal to some people who were not cured by the existing treatments and might want to try again. One of those is Michael Desroches, 44, of Methuen, Mass., who said he already had cirrhosis. “It’s not going to get any better by itself, obviously,” he said. Dr. Boger, who had been a chemist at Merck, started Vertex in 1989 with the aim of revolutionizing drug discovery. But it has been a costly and slow revolution and Vertex now finds itself competing with Dr. Boger’s former company. Vertex did develop two H.I.V. drugs that were sold by GlaxoSmithKline, and it has a couple of promising drugs for cystic fibrosis in development. Vertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., started on the hepatitis C project in 1993, a few years after the virus was first identified. In 1996, it published the three-dimensional structure of the virus’s protease enzyme. Then it set about finding a chemical that could block the enzyme’s activity. With the prospects for curing hepatitis C increased, efforts might shift to identifying more of the 3.2 million Americans said to be infected with hepatitis C. Health authorities say most of those infected, primarily baby boomers who might have been infected decades ago by injecting drugs, or through sex or blood transfusions, do not know it. That is because it can take decades for liver problems to show up, and many times they never do. Vertex is expected to start a public awareness campaign, with New York City being an initial focus. The company commissioned a study that made the case for screening all people 40 to 64 years old, not just those deemed to have risk factors.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/business/14drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">Victrelis, a Hepatitis C Drug From Merck, Is Approved<date>Published: May 13, 2011</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration approved on Friday the first of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that promises to increase the cure rate while shortening the time required for treatment.The new drug, Victrelis from Merck, effectively cured more than 60 percent of patients in clinical trials when used along with existing drugs. That compared with 20 to 40 percent of patients cured by the existing drugs alone. “This new medication provides an effective treatment for a serious disease, and offers a greater chance of cure for some patients hepatitis C infection compared to currently available therapy,” Dr. Edward Cox, director of the F.D.A.’s office of antimicrobial products, said in a statement. An estimated 3.2 million Americans have a chronic infection of the hepatitis C virus. The virus can cause serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer, though these problems may take decades to develop and may not develop at all. The existing treatment consists of nearly a year of weekly injections of long-lasting alpha interferon combined with ribavirin, a pill taken daily. The regimen is considered extremely harsh, with side effects including flulike symptoms, depression and anemia. It is not entirely clear how those drugs work. Victrelis, also known as boceprevir, inhibits an enzyme, called protease, that the virus needs in order to replicate. By blocking viral enzymes, Victrelis borrows a page from the strategy that has been successful in treating H.I.V. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is expected to win F.D.A. approval this month for its own hepatitis C protease inhibitor, starting a fierce marketing war with Merck. Based on clinical trial results, analysts generally expect Vertex’s drug to outsell Merck’s. Both drugs received unanimous recommendations from an F.D.A. advisory committee late last month. Many other companies are not far behind, making hepatitis C one of the hottest areas in the pharmaceutical industry. “Regardless of the ultimate success of this drug, it’s a harbinger of a great new era in treating patients with hepatitis C,” said Dr. Scott L. Friedman, chief of liver diseases at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York. While the Vertex drug, called telaprevir, and Victrelis must be used with the existing drugs, the hope is that in several years, three or four new drugs might be combined, as is done for H.I.V., doing away with the need for the interferon injections. For now, though, the Merck and Vertex drugs could allow some patients to clear the virus from their bodies with shorter durations of treatment. In Merck’s clinical trial, 44 percent of patients who had not previously been treated were able to complete their treatment in 28 weeks instead of the usual 48. Dr. Ira M. Jacobson, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said many patients have been forgoing treatment in order to wait for the approval of the new drugs. “There are also patients who have tried to be treated in the past, often more than once, and have been waiting for something that gives them a significant chance of success,” said Dr. Jacobson, who is a consultant to both Merck and Vertex and a speaker for Merck. Victrelis is approved for treatment of the genotype 1 strain of hepatitis C, which represents about 70 percent of the cases in the United States and is one of the toughest strains to treat. Merck set the wholesale price of Victrelis at $1,100 a week, meaning a full course of treatment will cost $26,400 to $48,400. Although the treatment takes 28 to 48 weeks, Victrelis is not used for the first four weeks. In Merck’s clinical trials, about half the patients who got Victrelis suffered from anemia, roughly double the rate for those who got only the existing drugs. The risk of having low white blood cell counts was also higher for those who got Victrelis. Moreover, patients will have to take a lot of pills. Victrelis is taken three times a day, with a total of 12 capsules daily. Ribavirin is taken twice a day, usually with a total of five or six pills. If patients do not take Victrelis faithfully, the virus might become resistant to the drug. Most people who are infected with hepatitis C virus do not know it, health authorities say. The biggest group consists of baby boomers who might have been infected decades ago through needles used to inject drugs, or through sex, blood transfusions or hemophilia medications.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/business/30merck.html?ref=merckandcompany">Merck’s Profit Surges on Sales and Cost Cuts<date>Published: April 29, 2011</date><text>First-quarter profit for Merck &amp; Company, the pharmaceutical company, more than tripled as strong sales of crucial drugs and lower costs from integrating its Schering-Plough acquisition offset competition from generic drugs, the company said Friday.The results beat Wall Street expectations and suggest drug sales and cost savings from acquiring Schering-Plough were starting to pay off. Merck shares rose 18 cents Friday to close at $35.95. Net income in the quarter was $1.04 billion, or 34 cents a share, up from $299 million, or 9 cents a share, in 2010’s first quarter. Revenue edged up 1 percent to $11.58 billion. That includes several billion dollars from products added in the Schering-Plough acquisition in November 2009. Excluding numerous one-time items, net income was $2.86 billion, or 92 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had forecast earnings of 84 cents a share and revenue of $11.38 billion. Analysts typically exclude one-time items in their estimates. The $1.82 billion in net charges included $1.58 billion in merger-related write-downs on the value of assets and research, $126 million in restructuring costs and a $500 million payment to settle arbitration with Johnson &amp; Johnson over the rights to two drugs. A year ago, Merck had charges totaling $2.31 billion. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., raised the bottom end of its 2011 profit forecast by 2 cents, predicting $3.66 to $3.76 a share, or $2.04 to $2.39 including one-time charges. Production costs fell 22 percent to $4.06 billion, partly because Merck has sold some factories. A Jeffries &amp; Company analyst, Ian Hilliker, wrote to investors that the higher revenue and lower-than-expected costs gave Merck a strong “earnings beat.” Top-performing drugs included Singulair and Januvia, plus some drugs acquired with Schering: the allergy spray Nasonex and Remicade for immune disorders. Their growth was partly offset by a $356 million drop in revenue from two former blockbuster heart drugs, Cozaar and Hyzaar, caused by generic competition. Januvia and Janumet, a pill that combines Januvia with the generic diabetes drug metformin, had combined quarterly sales that topped $1 billion for the first time, up 47 percent. Total pharmaceutical revenue rose 2 percent to $9.82 billion. Two units Merck acquired with Schering, animal health and consumer health, also performed well. Animal health revenue rose 7 percent and consumer health 6 percent, on strong sales of Claritin allergy pills and Coppertone sun care products.</text></article>

The debt would be partly used for “the consideration payable in respect of the Genzyme acquisition and related costs,” the company said. In February, Sanofi agreed to buy Genzyme, based in Cambridge, Mass., for at least $20.1 billion in cash after an acquisition battle of many months. The notes — six tranches that mature from 2012 to 2021 — offer yields of 0.05 percent to 4 percent. BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander were named as the joint book runners for the note issue. Separately on Tuesday, Sanofi announced the end of a deal with Merck to establish a joint venture in animal health that was valued at $5 billion. The two companies said the “mutual termination” was due to the “increasing complexity” of divestitures. Sanofi and Merck’s respective animal health divisions, Merial and Intervet/Schering-Plough, will continue to operate separately, and neither firm will incur a fee for the termination. Analysts had estimated that a combined company would have realized annual cost savings of about $300 million.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/business/04merck.html?ref=merckandcompany">Charges Give Merck $531 Million Quarterly Loss<date>Published: February 3, 2011</date><text>The drugmaker Merck &amp; Company said on Thursday that it lost $531 million in the fourth quarter as a result of nearly $4 billion in charges, including write-offs and restructuring costs from its acquisition of the Schering-Plough Corporation.Almost half the charges, $1.7 billion before taxes, were to account for the diminished prospects of the anticlotting drug vorapaxar, which had been considered a potential blockbuster. The company last month announced that because of a dangerous side effect, it would halt one late-stage study of the drug and remove some patients from a second study that continues. Merck also issued an earnings forecast for 2011 that was lower than Wall Street expectations and withdrew its long-term forecast. It cited pricing pressures from health care reform in the United States and cuts in European government health programs, as well vorapaxar’s link to increased bleeding in the brains of patients who had had strokes. Merck, the world’s second-biggest drugmaker behind Pfizer, said the fourth-quarter net loss amounted to 17 cents a share. A year earlier, Merck earned $6.49 billion, or $2.35 a share. The restructuring and other charges amounted to $1.05 a share, or $3.95 billion before taxes. Excluding the charges, Merck would have made 88 cents a share. Schering’s products helped raise revenue by 20 percent, to $12.1 billion from $10.1 billion. The results beat Wall Street forecasts. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of 83 cents a share and sales of $11.55 billion. Stock in Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., fell 92 cents, to $32.90 a share. The company, which makes the asthma and allergy drug Singulair, said it expected 2011 earnings of $3.64 to $3.76 a share. Analysts were looking for $3.81 a share, according to FactSet. Sales of Singulair, the diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet and the H.I.V. drug Isentress rose. But despite $1.35 billion in Singulair sales, total prescription drug revenue fell 2 percent, to $10.58 billion. Sales of animal health products rose 7 percent, to $815 million, and sales of consumer products like the nonprescription allergy pill Claritin climbed 8 percent to $251 million. The company said it was on track to reach its target of $3.5 billion in annual savings related to the merger by the end of 2012.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/business/28horan.html?ref=merckandcompany">John Horan, Former Chief of Merck, Dies at 90<date>Published: January 27, 2011</date><text>John Horan, who led Merck as it expanded its portfolio of pharmaceuticals and became the world’s largest drug maker, died on Saturday in Princeton, N.J. He was 90 and lived in Sea Girt, N.J.A spokesman for Merck, Ronald Rogers, announced the death. Mr. Horan was chief executive from 1976 to 1985, a period when Merck introduced a hepatitis B vaccine, as well as new antibiotics and drugs to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Under his watch, Merck also developed ivermectin, a drug that prevents and treats river blindness. Through a program administered by the World Health Organization, Merck donated ivermectin to countries where millions were afflicted by the disease, which is caused when black flies living in rapidly running rivers bite a person repeatedly, releasing parasitic worms. It brings excruciating itching, creates nodules under the skin and often results in blindness. By 1982, Mr. Horan had tripled the company’s research and development spending to $338 million, according to Fortune. He also increased the sales force and imposed what the magazine called “a new pragmatism.” “We’ve learned it’s not enough just to discover a blockbuster,” he told the magazine. “After you’ve made a breakthrough, you have to improve upon it. It used to be that if we came up with something and then somebody else took it the next step, we tended to walk away.” His strategy made him one of the highest-paid chief executives in the country. In 1984, U.S. News &amp; World Report put his salary and bonuses at $931,000, more than counterparts at corporations like Philip Morris and J. P. Morgan. John Joseph Horan was born July 9, 1920, on Staten Island. He attended Manhattan College on a scholarship, graduating in 1940. After serving in the Navy in World War II, he received a law degree from Columbia. He saw heavy combat as part of amphibious forces in several theaters of war, including North Africa and Italy. He later worked in a communications operation in Plymouth, England, and was on duty when Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower sent word to the allied fleet that the D-Day invasion was on. “My dad explained that there were three different shifts on the communications staff,” said John Horan Jr., “and the go-ahead from Ike happened to arrive during his shift.” Mr. Horan joined Merck in 1952 as part of its legal department. In 1957 he became spokesman for the Merck, Sharpe &amp; Dohme research laboratory in North Wales, Pa. Mr. Horan is survived by his wife of 66 years, Julia Fitzgerald; a daughter, Mary Alice Ryan of Spring Lake, N.J.; three sons, Thomas, of Hoboken, John Jr., of Sea Girt, and David, of Armonk, N.Y.; two sisters, Mary Smith of Lakewood, N.J., and Florence Keating of Wall, N.J.; a brother, Eugene, of Monroe, N.J.; and nine grandchildren.</text></article>

Frazier, the president of Merck, is to become chief executive of the pharmaceutical giant at the beginning of next year, the company said Tuesday. Mr. Frazier, 55, a lawyer by training who graduated from Harvard Law School, is believed to be the first African-American tapped to run a global drug powerhouse. Merck, which merged last year with Schering-Plough in a deal worth $49 billion, is the world's largest drug maker after Pfizer. Wall Street analysts had been widely expecting the move since April, when Merck appointed Mr. Frazier as president, a job in which he directed the company's three largest divisions: pharmaceutical and vaccine research and development, manufacturing and supply, and sales and marketing. Mr. Frazier will continue in that role. Mr. Frazier joined Merck in 1992 as vice president, general counsel and secretary of the Astra Merck group. Later, as the company's general counsel, Mr. Frazier developed an aggressive company strategy to fight litigation brought by consumers who claimed that they had developed major health problems after taking Vioxx, a painkiller that Merck withdrew in 2004. Wall Street analysts had estimated Merck's liability in the Vioxx litigation at $10 billion to $25 billion. In 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle about 27,000 Vioxx lawsuits. In 2007, Merck promoted Mr. Frazier to president of the company's global human health unit. Mr. Frazier said he would be taking over the company in a challenging environment in which government health programs, health insurers, hospitals and legislators worldwide are all looking for ways to trim medical costs. ''It is up to us to continue to bring forward the kind of innovative products that demonstrate value,'' Mr. Frazier said in a phone interview Tuesday, speaking of Merck drugs like Isentress, an H.I.V. medication, and Januvia for Type 2 diabetes. Mr. Frazier will succeed Richard T. Clark, 64, Merck's chief executive since 2005, who presided over the merger with Schering-Plough and who will continue in his role as chairman of the board. Mr. Clark said in a phone interview Tuesday that Mr. Frazier had demonstrated leadership over the last few years as he expanded the company's international operations, rolling out new drugs across the globe. Mr. Frazier's appointment, Mr. Clark said, was ''the result of a long-term and thoughtful process that the board of directors and myself put in place.'' Under Merck's mandatory retirement policy, which requires chief executives to step down after they turn 65, Mr. Clark would have been required to retire by April 1. Mr. Frazier's ascent continues a trend among leading health care firms of appointing business and legal executives - rather than medical and scientific experts - as company chiefs. In 2006, Pfizer named its general counsel, Jeffrey B. Kindler, as chief executive. In 2007, the Swiss medical giant Roche announced that Severin Schwan, a company veteran who holds a law degree from the University of Innsbruck, would take over as its chief the following year.

But the main benefit was not in reducing the risk of heart attacks and related deaths, but in reducing the artery operations and certain kinds of strokes, according to the data presented at a conference of kidney specialists this weekend in Denver. There were 213 major coronary events, including heart attacks and deaths, in the group that took the cholesterol pill compared to 230 in the placebo group; but that difference of 17 was not statistically significant, said Dr. Colin Baigent, a professor at Oxford University and one of two principal investigators on the study. The study, even though it was large, had not included enough people to demonstrate a significant difference in heart attacks and coronary deaths, he said. There was also no significant impact of cholesterol lowering in slowing the progression of kidney disease, such as in reducing the need for patients to start dialysis or undergo kidney transplants, he said. However the difference in operations to unblock arteries — 284 in the treated group compared to 352 in the placebo group — was statistically significant, Dr. Baigent said. The five-year study, called the Sharp trial, involved more than 9,000 patients who were randomly assigned to take either a placebo or Vytorin, a medicine made by Merck. Vytorin combines two different kinds of cholesterol-lowering treatments — a statin called simvastatin and a newer drug called ezetimibe, also known as Zetia — in one pill. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zetia, which lowers LDL or “bad” cholesterol, in 2002 and Vytorin in 2004. Since then, these cholesterol drugs have been taken by millions of people and have had worldwide sales of $26.8 billion, according to IMS Health, a health information company. But the drugs have been controversial. That is because, while studies have shown that taking statins has significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and related deaths, no study to date has reported that taking Zetia in addition to a statin or taking the Vytorin combination pill protects the heart better than a statin alone. Some cardiologists said that Zetia may not protect the heart like statins because it works differently in the body than those older drugs, some of which are available as inexpensive generics. Statins work by blocking the production of cholesterol in the liver while Zetia works in the gut to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from food. The Sharp trial, which was coordinated by researchers at Oxford University and financed primarily by Merck, is not likely to lessen the controversy because it was not designed to determine whether the combination pill works better than a statin alone. The study examined whether patients with chronic kidney disease, who are at high risk for heart problems, could safely benefit from significantly reducing their bad cholesterol. And, although the study showed improvement for some kinds of problems like artery operations, there is some debate on the extent of the overall benefit. After the Oxford researchers sent out an upbeat news release over the weekend saying that the combination pill could help people with chronic kidney disease avoid 25 percent of all heart attacks, strokes and surgeries to open blocked arteries, Merck issued its own release with a positive, but more sober, assessment. In a phone interview on Saturday, Dr. Baigent said his figures were an extrapolation that reflected the number of problems that might be reduced if people took the drug as prescribed — not the way they had in the study, in which one-third of both treated and placebo patients stopped taking their pills. “This is an important step forward for kidney disease,” Dr. Baigent said. “We’ve estimated that widespread use of lipid-lowering treatment would result in the prevention of heart attacks, strokes and operations to unblock arteries in 250,000 people” with chronic kidney disease each year. The Merck release said that Vytorin had reduced the risk of first major vascular events — including non-fatal heart attack, strokes, cardiac deaths and artery operations — by 16.1 percent compared to a placebo. That analysis was based on the originally designated goal of the study, which had included a greater variety of health problems. Based on these study results, Merck said in a statement Saturday that it planned to ask regulators to approve Vytorin for patients with chronic kidney disease. But some cardiologists said that the study showed that the main benefit to taking the drug was in reducing certain strokes and operations to unblock arteries, a significant problem, but not in reducing more dangerous heart attacks and deaths. Dr. Yale Mitchel, vice president of cardiovascular disease research at Merck, said that, although the effect of the drug on heart attacks and coronary deaths was not statistically significant, there were fewer such events in the treated patients, a positive sign. The study analyzed a combination of different heart problems, he said, and would have needed perhaps 40,000 people to provide a definitive answer for each one of them, he said. Kidney patients in the study did experience some benefit from the combination treatment, said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. But it was impossible to tell, he said, whether a statin alone would have done just as well. “The benefit may well be due to the fact that they got a statin,” Dr. Nissen said. Merck is sponsoring an even larger study that is comparing the cardio-protective effects of the combination treatment with that of a statin alone in a general population of people who were already taking a statin to control their cholesterol. That study, involving about 18,000 patients, is due to conclude in 2013, Merck said. Last week, Oxford University said Merck had given £96 million — roughly $150 million — to help pay for an even bigger study on a different cholesterol drug, the largest single research contract ever entered into by the school.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/business/20fosamax.html?ref=merckandcompany">Merck Not at Fault in Fosamax Trial, Jurors Decide<date>Published: November 19, 2010</date><text>Merck on Friday won a signature jury trial against Judith Graves, a Florida woman who had sued the company and claimed that its osteoporosis drug, Fosamax, caused her jawbone to disintegrate.A Manhattan civil court jury issued its verdict several hours after lawyers had presented their closing arguments in the case. The decision represents the second of three bellwether jury trials on this issue to end in Merck’s favor. They and other cases are among litigation involving about 1,400 people across the country who have claimed they developed jawbone ailments after taking Fosamax, according to Timothy M. O’Brien, Mrs. Graves’s lawyer. In a third trial, a judge reduced the jury’s award to $1.5 million from $8 million, but both sides want to appeal. Another signature case is set to go to trial in March. Friday’s verdict comes at a time when many physicians are rethinking the long-term use of Fosamax and other osteoporosis drugs known as oral bisphosphonates. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration issued a public advisory saying the drugs had been linked with — although not definitively as the cause of — rare thigh fractures. The agency will now require the labels of oral bisphosphonates to state that the optimum duration of taking the drugs is not known. In Mrs. Graves’s case, Merck argued that Fosamax did not cause Mrs. Graves’s jawbone disintegration, a condition that led to several operations to replace her jawbone. Mrs. Graves, Merck argued, was taking other prescription drugs, including steroids for rheumatoid arthritis, that can weaken the immune system, and she had other health issues that can lead to jaw and dental problems. “We believe the evidence showed the company acted properly, and that Fosamax did not cause the plaintiff’s dental and jaw problems,” Mike Brock, outside counsel for Merck, said in a statement. As it deliberated Friday afternoon, the jury asked just one question of the judge — the date of the first medical journal report of a possible association between Fosamax and the rare jawbone problem, known as osteonecrosis or jawbone death, lawyers for both sides said Friday. Because the first published report appeared in October of 2003, six months after Mrs. Graves’s condition became evident, the jury may have concluded that Merck could not possibly have known about such an association at the time of the plaintiff’s dental problems. The jury voted seven to zero that Fosamax was not a defective product, said Paul F. Strain, outside counsel for Merck. “We continue to believe that Fosamax is a good medication for a very bad disease,” Mr. Strain said. “We think the jury verdict closely supports our belief.” In the company’s statement, Bruce N. Kuhlik, executive vice president and general counsel of Merck, said the company was pleased with the jury’s verdict. “The company provided appropriate and timely information about Fosamax to consumers and the medical, scientific and regulatory communities,” he said.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/health/research/18merck.html?ref=merckandcompany">Merck Drug to Raise Good Cholesterol and Lower Bad Shows Promise<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>Merck has a potential blockbuster in anacetrapib, an experimental cholesterol drug that increases HDL, or “good” cholesterol even as it lowers LDL, the “bad” cholesterol. The drug could potentially have sales of more than $1 billion a year, John Boris, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. But don’t hold your breath. Cardiologists, patients and investors will have to wait until at least 2015 to find out whether anacetrapib protects the heart by reducing heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems, Merck said. Anacetrapib works by inhibiting an enzyme called CETP, which is involved in transforming particles of good cholesterol into bad cholesterol. According to a new study of 1,623 patients who were already taking statins to control their cholesterol, patients in a group taking anacetrapib had a 39.8 percent reduction in bad cholesterol beyond that seen in the placebo group. More strikingly, the anacetrapib group also had a 138.1 percent increase in good cholesterol, according to the study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. That is promising in theory, physicians said, because epidemiological studies — the kind that look at the incidence of a disease among a population — have reported an association between high levels of good cholesterol and a reduced risk of heart problems. But the real impact of anacetrapib on heart health will not be known until researchers conduct a much larger study looking into whether the drug can reduce the risk of heart attacks, coronary deaths and other heart problems, said Dr. Luciano Rossetti, the head of global scientific strategy at Merck Research Laboratories. The results “are promising and reassuring, but not conclusive,” Dr. Rossetti said in a phone interview. “That is why we are going forward with 30,000 patients in a very large outcomes trial.” Merck is spending £96 million — roughly $150 million — to sponsor the larger study, which is being coordinated by researchers at Oxford University and will not conclude before 2015, he said. Merck needs such outcomes data before it seeks approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug, cardiologists said, because a similar experimental drug from Pfizer turned out to be problematic. In 2004, an early study of people taking that Pfizer drug, a CETP inhibitor called torcetrapib, reported that it could lower bad cholesterol and improve good cholesterol. But a large outcomes study later indicated that the drug increased the risk of death by 59 percent and of heart attacks by 25 percent. After spending more than $800 million to develop the drug, Pfizer ended development in 2006. Dr. Rossetti said Merck researchers closely examined the Pfizer drug to make sure there were no similar problems. Torcetrapib, for example, can increase levels of aldosterone, a hormone that can increase blood pressure, he said. But the new study reported no significant differences in change in blood pressure or in aldosterone levels between the anacetrapib and placebo groups. The study also reported that there were 16 major cardiac events — among them four deaths from cardiovascular causes — in the anacetrapib group compared to 21 major heart problems, including one cardiovascular-related death, in the placebo group. But the difference was not statistically significant, the study said. The anacetrapib group also underwent fewer operations, called revascularizations, to open an artery. Dr. Howard Weintraub, a cardiologist who is the clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at the NYU Langone Medical Center, said anacetrapib’s ability to increase good cholesterol was impressive. But he said cardiologists did not yet know whether artificially increasing good cholesterol levels automatically had a protective effect on the heart. Good cholesterol, Dr. Weintraub said, functions like a garbage truck, taking out the trash that is bad cholesterol. The quality, not just the amount, of that good cholesterol may be important for reducing the risk of heart problems, he said. But artificially increasing that good cholesterol with a drug may not have the same impact on the heart as naturally increasing it. Only the larger outcomes study on anacetrapib can answer the heart health question, he said.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/health/11bone.html?ref=merckandcompany">Fosamax Lawsuits Question Wide Use of Osteoporosis Drugs<date>Published: November 10, 2010</date><text>Judith Graves, a 67-year-old retired investigator for the United States Army, developed a rare medical condition called jawbone death after taking Fosamax, a drug used by millions of American women with thinning bones.In a civil trial now under way in Manhattan, Mrs. Graves is suing Merck, the maker of Fosamax. Her lawyer, Timothy M. O’Brien, told the jury that Fosamax had caused such debilitating jawbone deterioration that Mrs. Graves required five major operations, including a lengthy surgery to replace her broken jaw with bone from her left arm. Merck has argued that Fosamax is not the culprit. In its defense, Merck contends that Mrs. Graves took other prescriptions — like steroids to treat rheumatoid arthritis — that weakened her immune system, leading to her jaw infection and healing problems, said Paul F. Strain, outside counsel for the company. The lawsuit is one of a handful of bellwether cases against Merck representing litigation involving about 1,400 people across the country who say they developed jawbone ailments after taking Fosamax, Mr. O’Brien said. Merck won an earlier case; but in another, a judge proposed to reduce a plaintiff’s jury award to $1.5 million from $8 million (both sides plan to appeal). In Mrs. Graves’s case, the trial is providing a palpable backdrop for a broadening debate among many doctors and researchers who are rethinking Fosamax and similar bone medications known as oral bisphosphonates, particularly as a treatment for women who have not yet developed osteoporosis. An advisory issued last month by the Food and Drug Administration, which first approved Fosamax in the 1990s to treat and prevent osteoporosis, along with reports in medical journals linking bisphosphonates with some rare medical problems including unusual thigh fractures, has heightened scrutiny of the long-term use of these medications. While the F.D.A. cautioned that it was not clear that oral bisphosphonates had caused the rare thigh breaks, it said these kinds of bone fractures might be related to lengthy treatments with the drugs. The agency will now require the labels on Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, Reclast and Atelvia and generic alternatives to state that the optimal period for using the drugs is unknown. That uncertainty has shadowed the debate over how and when to prescribe these bone drugs, especially because they have been successful, by most accounts, in significantly reducing fractures over several years in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. From 1999 to 2009, Fosamax and a newer drug, Fosamax Plus D, had worldwide sales of more than $23.8 billion, according to IMS Health, a health information company that tracks drug sales. But the drugs’ popularity and effectiveness for generally healthy women without osteoporosis or broken bones have become a source of increasing argument in doctors’ offices and in courtrooms. Doctors had already started to review the unlimited use of oral bisphosphonates, said Dr. Elizabeth Shane, a professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Fifteen years ago, she said, the medical community hoped that if women took the drugs before they developed osteoporosis, they would be protected from breaking bones later in life. But doctors have begun waiting longer before prescribing the drugs, she added. “We are moving much more to targeting people later in the development of osteoporosis when they are at high risk of fracture, since we’re not entirely clear yet how long is the most appropriate length of time to treat a person,” said Dr. Shane, who has received research grants from Merck, Eli Lilly and Novartis. Adults generally lose bone mass as they age. But the process accelerates in menopause when cells called osteoclasts start breaking down a larger amount of older bone than can be replaced by other cells, called osteoblasts. Bisphosphonates work by inhibiting that breakdown, thereby conserving bone density. In one arm of a study called the Fracture Intervention Trial, or FIT, sponsored by Merck and involving about 2,000 women ages 55 to 81 with an existing vertebral fracture, Fosamax cut the risk of a new vertebral fracture by about half compared with a placebo. “Before these drugs came on the market, we really had nothing,” said Dr. Margaret Seton, a rheumatologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “When you have no drug and you’ve seen a patient and watched their spine crumble, that’s heartbreaking.” But for those whose bones have not thinned enough to be classified as having osteoporosis, potential treatments are in real flux. In the FIT trial, for example, Fosamax significantly reduced the risk of clinical fractures in women with osteoporosis but not among those with higher bone mineral density, according to an analysis published in 1998. In a separate analysis of the FIT data that year, Anthony Mucci, a statistical reviewer at the F.D.A. wrote that, for women without osteoporosis, there was no measurable benefit shown “for any category of fracture.”</text></article>

Net income fell 90 percent, to $342 million, the company said. Sales increased 84 percent, to $11.1 billion after adding the products from its $49.6 billion acquisition of the Schering-Plough Corporation last November. Merck said that it was on track to cut 15,000 jobs from its combined work force and close plants to save $3.5 billion in annual costs by 2012. “Focus on cost control is working,” said Marc Goodman, an analyst at UBS Securities, in a note to clients. “We continue to see this as a cost-cutting story ahead of major pipeline events and think management is doing a good job.” Merck raised the lower end of its 2010 earnings forecast to $3.31 to $3.39 a share, excluding one-time items. The company previously said it anticipated profit of $3.29 to $3.39. Shares in Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., fell 63 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $36.31. Merck’s $950 million legal reserve was set aside for the anticipated resolution of an investigation by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts. The case was previously disclosed, and talks with the government continue, Merck said Friday. Merck withdrew Vioxx in 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/business/01lilly.html?ref=merckandcompany">Patents Ending, Eli Lilly Chases New Drugs<date>Published: September 30, 2010</date><text>INDIANAPOLIS — John C. Lechleiter walks a mile to work every morning to think about the day ahead. He walks home in the evening, he says, “to try to forget about it.”These are challenging times for Eli Lilly, the company he leads. It is losing patent protection in the next seven years on drugs that accounted for 74 percent of its sales in 2009, a decline considered to be the worst patent cliff facing major companies in the industry. And it also had been hit by recent legal, regulatory and research disappointments, including the surprise announcement in August that a promising experimental drug treatment for Alzheimer’s was being dropped because it hurt patients’ cognitive functions more than it helped. As a result of the compound issues confronting the company, analysts and others have been pressuring Lilly to undergo major transformations similar to those of its rivals Pfizer and Merck, which made giant purchases of other companies in efforts to diversify and spur growth. For Lilly and Dr. Lechleiter, the company’s fortunes are not all that is at stake. Its economic health is closely interwoven with its hometown roots here, where it also works with about 3,000 Indiana businesses. Dr. Lechleiter, a chemist who joined Lilly 31 years ago and was named chief executive in 2008, remains confident of the company’s strategy. He asserts that it can retool with in-house research and cost-cutting, rather than resorting to mergers or big acquisitions. In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Dr. Lechleiter held to the company’s promise that revenue would not dip below $20 billion even in the expected low-tide year of 2014. He said efforts to trim $1 billion in costs and 5,500 employees by the end of 2011 were on track. And he pointed to the potential for new drugs and pending decisions by the Food and Drug Administration that might expand the markets for existing Lilly drugs. “We’ll see our way through the storm,” he said. “At a time when others say Lilly has to do a deal or Lilly has to go outside itself to solve its problems, we’re resolutely focused on what we have to do inside the company to make the innovative medicines that are at the core of value creation for Lilly and patients. That’s what we do.” Long a powerhouse for psychiatric drugs like Prozac, Zyprexa and Cymbalta, Lilly is looking to new drug opportunities in treating cancer and Alzheimer’s, two diseases that Mr. Lechleiter said will become more pressing as Americans live longer. Some analysts do not share his optimism, and point to a lack of promising products in the company’s short-term outlook. For example, Lilly has introduced only one product in the last five years, the blood thinner Effient, to sluggish early sales. It has virtually no new products to market until 2013, when it hopes to start rolling out two a year. The patent losses are daunting: Its schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, whose $4.92 billion in sales last year represented 23 percent of the company’s total, goes off patent a year from now. Cymbalta, with $3.07 billion in sales, loses patent protection in 2013. In addition, Lilly lost legal challenges this year to Gemzar, a cancer drug that sold $1.36 billion, and Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that sold $609 million. J. P. Morgan last week predicted Lilly would face “a prolonged period of depressed earnings” with sales dipping to $18.6 billion in 2015 from a peak of $23 billion in 2010. C . Anthony Butler of Barclays Capital called for Lilly to make some drastic changes, predicting that its revenue could drop to $18.8 billion in 2015. “I’m not sure what would drive the going-back-up part,” he said in an interview. He also cited the company’s longtime relationship to Indianapolis as an impediment to taking measures like slashing costs to preserve its margins and dividends. “I worry that they can’t do that because they’re too ingrained in the fabric of the community,” Mr. Butler said. Indeed, since its founding here in 1876, Lilly has become the city’s largest private employer. Mayor Greg Ballard’s father worked there for 33 years; the former mayor, Bart Peterson, works there now; and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels spent eight years on the Lilly campus. Indianapolis, a city of about 800,000, is undergoing a tax-supported, $3.3 billion downtown building boom as it gears up to host the 2012 Super Bowl. On Monday, the city, company and a developer announced plans to develop one corner of a sprawling Lilly parking lot into a $150 million hotel, apartment, retail and restaurant complex. “A recruiting magnet,” Dr. Lechleiter said as he walked through the lot, pulling a small wheeled suitcase filled with paperwork, on the way to work. He walks, he said, for exercise and time to reflect. Dr. Lechleiter said he has accepted a ride only once, in a snowstorm, in the four years since he and his wife moved closer to work, living in a penthouse in a downtown luxury hotel. As he passed through the lobby and hallways, he greeted a dozen employees by their first names before settling in his small corner office.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/health/policy/14drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">U.S. Broadens Bribery Inquiry Into Drug Makers<date>Published: August 13, 2010</date><text>At least a dozen major drug and device makers are under investigation by federal prosecutors and securities regulators in a broadening bribery inquiry into whether the companies made illegal payments to doctors and health officials in foreign countries.In previous investigations, federal officials have charged that some companies made these kinds of payments to encourage doctors abroad to order or prescribe their products. In the United States, companies routinely hire doctors as consultants to market drugs and devices to their colleagues and other health professionals at medical conventions and small gatherings. Such consulting arrangements are legal in the United States as long as the companies do not pay doctors directly to write prescriptions for their products. But in much of the rest of the world, doctors are government employees. And even consulting arrangements that would be considered routine in the United States might violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, particularly if the payments are outsize or the arrangements are not disclosed to the governments. Of even greater concern to prosecutors in the United States are unusually large payments made to foreign doctors who oversee the growing number of clinical trials that drug and device makers conduct abroad, according to Kirk Ogrosky, a former top federal prosecutor who now represents drug and device makers at a Washington law firm. More than 80 percent of the drugs approved for sale in 2008 involved trials in foreign countries, and 78 percent of all people who participated in clinical trials were enrolled at foreign sites, according to a recent investigation by Daniel R. Levinson, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. Medical ethicists have long worried that many of these trials are conducted in countries that federal auditors rarely visit and where research controls may be scant. Now, prosecutors are investigating whether the payments made to doctors who conducted these studies abroad were appropriate. If evidence shows that such payments have influenced the results of some clinical trials, prosecutors will be inspecting the trials closely, Mr. Ogrosky said. An article about the inquiry appeared Friday in The Financial Times. Last month, a federal drug official reported that he found repeated instances in a landmark clinical trial of Avandia, a controversial diabetes medicine, in which patients taking Avandia appeared to suffer serious heart problems that were not counted in the study’s crucial tally of adverse events. Many of the study’s trial sites were in foreign countries, and the study is a main reason that Avandia remains on the market in the United States. Government officials have not accused GlaxoSmithKline, the trial’s sponsor, of fraud. “At the Justice Department, investigations that involve allegations of patient harm rise straight to the top and will attract the immediate attention of the F.B.I.,” Mr. Ogrosky said. The pharmaceutical industry may be more vulnerable to such investigations because its representatives overseas work on a daily basis with officials or doctors employed by state health systems. Because pharmaceutical companies “are in the health care sector and because, in so many foreign countries, heath sector employees could be considered foreign officials, there is a heightened risk there,” said Jay Darden, a Washington lawyer and former federal prosecutor who specialized in health care and foreign corrupt practice cases. But, he said, just because some companies have publicly disclosed that they are under investigation does not automatically mean they have violated the foreign bribery law. Indeed, a number of drug makers and medical device companies have reported in recent regulatory filings that they are under investigation for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, for example, Merck said it was cooperating with a federal investigation seeking information about the company’s activities in a number of countries. Johnson &amp; Johnson said in a regulatory filing that it had voluntary disclosed to federal agencies that company subsidiaries abroad may have made improper payments in connection with the sale of medical devices in two countries. Eli Lilly said it was cooperating with a federal investigation into the activities of subsidiaries in Poland and other countries. Meanwhile, the device maker Medtronic said it was cooperating with a federal investigation into the company’s activities in a number of countries, including Greece, Poland, Germany, Turkey, Italy and Malaysia. The device maker Zimmer also said it was the subject of federal investigations in connection with the sale of its products in a number of foreign countries. In a speech in November, an official at the Justice Department alerted drug makers that the agency would be focusing on the drug industry. “In some foreign countries and under certain circumstances, nearly every aspect of the approval, manufacture, import, export, pricing, sale and marketing of a drug product may involve a ‘foreign official,’ ” as defined by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the agency’s criminal division, said in the speech. “The depth of government involvement in foreign health systems, combined with fierce industry competition and the closed nature of many public formularies, creates, in our view, a significant risk that corrupt payments will infect the process.” The federal inquiry is part of a broader reassessment of the financial relationships between medical product companies and doctors, who even in the United States serve a government procurement role when they order drugs or devices for patients whose care is paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or another government health program. Federal law will soon require companies to publicly disclose consulting payments made to doctors; some companies have already started making information about such payments public. A number of medical schools and professional medical societies have recently issued rules banning or restricting some of these financial arrangements. Nearly a dozen companies have already settled foreign bribery charges with prosecutors in a string of cases that started in 2002 with a settlement by Syncor. The company paid a relatively modest fine of $2.5 million to resolve criminal and securities charges that the company used gifts, inflated invoices and improper referral payments to encourage doctors in state-owned hospitals abroad to order company products and send patients to company-owned imaging centers. Last year, Novo Nordisk, a Danish company, agreed to pay a $9 million fine to settle charges that it had paid former government officials in Iraq to obtain government contracts to provide insulin and other drugs. Novo paid the former Iraqi government about $1.4 million by inflating the price of its contracts by 10 percent before submitting them to the United Nations for approval, according to a Justice Department press release. Since the fines paid so far are relatively modest, the current federal inquiries into possible foreign bribes may end up having a larger impact on the marketing strategies of medical product makers than on their bottom lines. Even so, Mr. Darden, the former Justice Department official, said drug company executives would do well to remind their foreign subsidiaries not to bribe local officials or doctors. “They should set a tone at the top that makes it clear to a company’s international sales force that these types of payments are unacceptable,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/health/05drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">Promising Results Reported for Cholesterol and Hepatitis C Drugs<date>Published: August 4, 2010</date><text>New drugs for hepatitis C and superhigh cholesterol succeeded in late-stage clinical trials, the developers of the products announced on Wednesday. But both drugs have side effects that could dampen sales, analysts said. Merck said that its drug boceprevir, when added to the existing therapy, effectively cured about two-thirds of patients with hepatitis C. That was far better than the cure rate with the existing therapy alone. Isis Pharmaceuticals and Genzyme said its drug mipomersen significantly lowered LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, in patients who still had very high cholesterol levels despite taking the highest tolerable dose of statins. Merck is in a heated race with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to bring to market the first of a new class of hepatitis C drugs that are expected to make treatment far more effective and possibly shorter in duration. The existing treatment, using alpha interferon and ribavirin, takes nearly a year, causes severe side effects and succeeds in eradicating the virus only about half the time. The initial reading of Wall Street was that boceprevir might be a bit less attractive than Vertex’s candidate, telaprevir, in part because Merck’s drug caused fairly high rates of anemia. Shares of Vertex rose $1.02, or 2.9 percent, Wednesday to $36.26. Shares of Merck closed up 37 cents, or 1 percent, to $35.19. Merck said that in one trial of 1,097 patients getting treatment for hepatitis C for the first time, 66 percent of those who had a 48-week regimen that included boceprevir had a sustained virologic response. That compared with 38 percent for those who got the existing therapy plus a placebo. The corresponding figures from Vertex’s Phase 3 trial were 75 percent and 44 percent. A sustained virologic response means the virus was undetectable in the patient’s blood 24 weeks after treatment ended. Many doctors consider that a cure. Merck’s other trial involved about 400 patients for whom previous treatment had been unsuccessful. About 66 percent of those who received boceprevir in the 48-week regimen were effectively cured, triple the 21 percent rate in the control group. Vertex is expected to report its Phase 3 results in previously treated patients in September. “This is a compelling profile for boceprevir,” said Peter S. Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratories. He said that Merck would complete its application to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year. Isis and Genzyme said they would apply for approval of their cholesterol-lowering drug in the first half of 2011. Mipomersen would be Isis’s first big product and would validate its “anti-sense” technology for turning off genes. Genzyme could cite the promise of mipomersen to demand a higher price from Sanofi-Aventis, which is interested in buying Genzyme. In one trial, patients who took mipomersen had an average reduction of 36 percent in LDL after 26 weeks, while those getting a placebo had a 13 percent increase. In the other study, those who got the drug had a reduction of 37 percent versus a reduction of 5 percent for a placebo. Yet more than 20 percent of the patients in each of the trials dropped out because of side effects. The biggest concern is that the drug might cause liver damage. “Efficacy looks good but safety remains a key risk,” Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. Shares of Isis fell 56 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $9.43. Shares of Genzyme fell 79 cents, or 1 percent, to $69.41. The companies are initially aiming mipomersen at a relatively small number of patients who have a genetic disorder that leads to extremely high levels of cholesterol. But the companies hope to eventually expand to broader markets, if safety allows that.</text></article>

Merck plans to lay off about 15 percent of its work force -- about 15,000 people -- over the next two years as part of a global merger restructuring, according to an announcement the company issued on Thursday. Merck said it also planned to close eight research and eight manufacturing sites worldwide. The restructuring is expected to save $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion in 2012, the company said. Meanwhile, the pretax cost of the initial phase of the cost-cutting program is expected to range from $3.5 billion to $4.3 billion, much of it in severance packages for employees. ''The goal of the restructuring is to create a flexible R.&amp;D. organization that cultivates scientific innovation, facilitates external collaboration and drives pipeline progress and a reliable, more fully utilized and cost-efficient worldwide manufacturing supply chain to support Merck's broader product portfolio,'' the company said in a statement. Merck makes the osteoporosis medication Fosamax, the allergy and asthma drug Singulair and the Gardasil vaccine for the human papillomavirus. In the merger, Merck acquired popular Schering-Plough brands like the nasal spray Nasonex, the allergy drug Claritin and the Coppertone sunscreen brand. As part of the postmerger reorganization, Merck said it planned to create an international network of 16 major research and development centers. It had indicated in February on an earnings conference call that the work force would shrink, as a result of the merger, by as much as 15 percent. Meanwhile, over the next two years, the company plans to close a total of eight research sites -- in Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Scotland and Cambridge, Mass. The company also plans to stop manufacturing at a total of eight plants: in Italy, Portugal, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Singapore and Miami Lakes, Fla. As a result of mergers and cutbacks in sales forces, the pharmaceutical industry has been shedding jobs over the last few years. In the first half of this year, drug makers announced that they planned to cut about 35,000 jobs, according to a report published last week by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Last year, drug makers said that they planned to cut 51,549 jobs, the report said. That figure included an announcement by Pfizer, which merged last year with Wyeth, that it planned to reduce the combined work force by about 19,500. As of May, 277,200 people in the United States were employed in pharmaceutical manufacturing That is a decrease of 5 percent compared with two years ago.</text></article>

But it has never been clear whether reducing homocysteine will cut the risk, and whether the substance actually causes vascular disease. A paper published in The Journal of the American Medical Association says it does not. The paper is based on a large, randomized, controlled clinical trial in Britain from 1998 to 2008. More than 12,000 heart-attack survivors were randomly assigned to take either a combination of folic acid and vitamin B 12, which reduce homocysteine levels, or a placebo. After seven years, patients who were taking the vitamins had lowered their homocysteine, butdid not reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke. They had the same rates of heart attack and death from vascular causes as those taking placebos, the study found. The research ''conclusively shows that these vitamins do not prevent heart attack and strokes as we had previously hoped they might,'' Dr. Jane Armitage, professor of clinical trials and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, and one of the authors of the paper, said in an e-mail message. The study was financed by Merck, which makes both cholesterol-lowering drugs and vitamins; Merck supplied the vitamins used in the trial. GRAPHIC</text></article>

It was the second time the rankings, which were created in 2008, have been issued. This time, 95 percent of the brand-name companies approached by the Dutch foundation that started the index agreed to provide information; two years ago, only about half did. European companies slightly edged out American companies in the rankings, while the four Japanese companies ranked were at or near the bottom. The companies are graded on many factors, including whether they offer lower prices or donate drugs in poor countries, whether they license generic versions of their products or fight to prevent them, whether they donate expertise or money to struggling health systems and whether they do research on neglected diseases. Gilead Sciences and Pfizer rose several ranks from 2008. Those falling in rank were Novo Nordisk, Bayer, Bristol-Meyers Squibb and Merck KGaA (a German company no longer connected to the Merck based in New Jersey). The index, which is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Dutch and British governments, Oxfam and other donors, also issued detailed “report cards” on 20 companies. For the first time, generic drug makers were ranked separately. Three Indian companies, Ranbaxy Laboratories, Cipla and Dr. Reddy’s, took the top three spots.</text></article>

The jury in New York set damages at $8 million in the case of Shirley Boles, 72, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., who said she developed osteonecrosis of the jaw by taking Fosamax. With osteonecrosis, a bone is no longer alive and cannot regenerate because of a lack of blood supply, according to the National Osteonecrosis Foundation’s Web site. The first Fosamax case resulted in a Merck victory in May. United States District Judge John F. Keenan, who is overseeing federal Fosamax litigation, scheduled three bellwether trials that might point the way to out-of-court settlements and show each side the other’s strategy. The third case is to be tried in November. “We believe the jury verdict was a result of plaintiff’s counsel’s inflammatory and prejudicial remarks,” Paul F. Strain, a lawyer for Merck, said in a statement.</text></article>

Pfizer and Merck -- the world's top two drug manufacturers by 2009 sales, according to IMS Health -- are counting on huge cost savings in the next few years from acquisitions of rivals Wyeth (by Pfizer) and Schering-Plough (by Merck). ''It looks like both companies are already getting leverage from merger-related cost savings, and it's going right to the bottom line,'' Damien Conover, a Morningstar analyst, said. ''This is a trend that we'll see continue going forward.'' Results of drug manufacturers in the quarter were hurt by the new health insurance overhaul legislation, which requires companies to provide larger price rebates to patients in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor. ''The results for Merck and Pfizer also complete that theme we've seen for other drug makers this quarter, that largely good results are offsetting the costs of health care reform,'' Mr. Conover said. Richard T. Clark, chairman and chief executive of Merck, told investors the health care overhaul should bolster his company's results over the long term. Merck earned $299 million, or 9 cents a share, in the first quarter. Results were hurt by special charges and a tax expense related to the health care law. That compared with $1.43 billion, or 67 cents a share a year ago. Excluding special items, Merck earned 83 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 75 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Merck's revenue more than doubled to $11.42 billion on the strength of the Schering deal. Analysts looked for $11.18 billion. Sales of the Januvia diabetes franchise jumped 32 percent to $712 million, including explosive growth outside the United States, well ahead of the estimate of $622.2 million by six analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., also said the quarterly results were helped by a $75 million to $100 million inventory buildup of its vaccines in the United States, and lower-than-expected research spending that should not continue in coming quarters. The company expects 2010 earnings of $3.27 to $3.41 a share, excluding special items. Analysts were expecting $3.41 a share. The forecast reflects flat earnings to a decline of 4.2 percent, largely because of plunging sales of its Cozaar blood pressure drug that began facing generic rivals last month. Pfizer earned $2.03 billion, or 25 cents a share in the quarter. That compared with $2.73 billion, or 40 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 60 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 53 cents a share. Pfizer posted revenue of about $16.75 billion. Analysts looked for $16.58 billion. Sales of its Lipitorcholesterol drug inched up 1 percent to $2.76 billion, above the estimate of $2.64 billion of eight analysts. Pfizer backed its 2010 profit forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 a share, excluding items, despite a revenue hit from the new health care law. The forecast reflects growth of 4 percent to 9 percent. The company, which is based in New York, affirmed its 2012 profit forecast of $2.25 to $2.35 a share, excluding items. The outlook tracks Wall Street's expectations for 2011, suggesting the Wyeth merger will prevent Pfizer earnings from plunging once Lipitor gets generic competition as soon as late 2011.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/28bizcourt.html?ref=merckandcompany">Supreme Court Allows Investors to Sue Merck Over Vioxx<date>Published: April 27, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Tuesday that investors who lost millions betting on the blockbuster drug Vioxx could sue the maker, Merck &amp; Company, over whether it provided enough information about the painkiller’s risks before it was withdrawn from the market. The Supreme Court agreed with a federal appeals court’s decision to allow a class-action securities lawsuit. The suit was over whether the drug maker provided adequate information about the drug’s risks before its withdrawal. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., withdrew the drug on Sept. 30, 2004, because it doubled the risks of heart attack, stroke and death. Investors lost tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value overnight. The class-action lawsuit will now move forward in federal court. “Merck is disappointed in today’s decision, but believes that the allegations in the complaint are unfounded and will continue to defend itself vigorously,” said Bruce Kuhlik, the drug maker’s executive vice president and general counsel. “The company has already made a motion to dismiss the operative complaint on numerous other grounds and will renew that motion in the district court.” Investors have two years to sue a company accused of defrauding investors. Merck argued that the two-year clock began when the first hint of Vioxx trouble was made public in September 2001. Investors argued that the two-year time limit should not have been started in 2001. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing a unanimous judgment for the court, agreed with the investors. “The plaintiff’s suit is timely,” he said. After it took Vioxx off the market, Merck was sued by shareholders, patients and survivors saying that Vioxx caused heart attacks and strokes, and from insurance plans seeking reimbursement for their costs for covering Vioxx prescriptions.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/business/04stream.html?ref=merckandcompany">Does Merck Agreement Pave a Road Toward Change?<date>Published: April 3, 2010</date><text>SHAREHOLDERS of Merck sued in 2004, contending that current and former company officers and directors had breached their fiduciary duties in the marketing of the painkiller Vioxx, causing investors to lose billions. And all the shareholders got for their suit was a settlement agreement, approved last month in a New Jersey state court in Atlantic City. Plaintiffs have also asked for $12.15 million to cover legal fees. While the financial toll won’t ultimately be very high in the case, the settlement’s terms represent what may turn out to be a pivotal moment in the corporate governance arena. The settlement agreement requires Merck to enact some innovative governance reforms, like hiring a chief medical officer to serve as something of an independent ombudsman, charged with monitoring product marketing and safety. The agreement also tasks board members for the first time with safeguarding research ethics and drug safety. And it calls for two new committees — one to look after product safety and another to address risks to the company. So, does the agreement constitute a solid bulwark, protecting investors and consumers against the possibility of another Vioxx? Or is it just an effort that looks promising but will ultimately do little to keep potentially risky drugs from becoming blockbusters? In a decade that has seen the collapse of Enron, the implosion of some venerable Wall Street firms and damage to Toyota’s once seemingly bulletproof reputation, the question of management’s duties to shareholders and consumers goes well beyond Vioxx. And that’s what makes the governance changes at Merck so instructive. For Merck, the agreement eliminates the burden and uncertainty of further litigation, allowing the company to focus on its primary business of discovering, developing and marketing innovative drugs, Bruce N. Kuhlik, its general counsel, said in a statement. The settlement “is fair and reflects best practices in corporate governance that benefit Merck and its shareholders,” Mr. Kuhlik said. The company hired a chief medical officer in December and notified investors about the proposed settlement terms in February. But Merck, which voluntarily took Vioxx off the market in 2004 when a study reported that people taking the drug had an increased risk of cardiovascular problems, did not acknowledge any liabilities in the shareholder litigation. And Merck has never acknowledged liabilities in connection with lawsuits filed by thousands of patients alleging that they suffered health problems after taking Vioxx, although the company agreed in 2007 to a $4.85 billion settlement in the United States. Shares of Merck plunged 27 percent on Sept. 30, 2004, the day it withdrew Vioxx from the world market, cutting its overall market capitalization by about $27 billion and shaking investors’ confidence. The company’s public standing hasn’t fully recovered since then. In the 1980’s, Merck had a reputation as a company with a deep commitment to science and integrity. But plaintiffs’ attorneys in some of the Vioxx jury trials contended that corporate changes made at Merck in the 1990s put the bottom line ahead of science or the company’s larger social responsibilities. The new settlement agreement is intended to create more transparency at Merck, to ensure scientific integrity and to safeguard drug and patient safety, Carol E. Higbee, the judge who presided over the shareholder suit, said during a court hearing last month. “The corporate governance changes hopefully will be helpful to the shareholders because they will prevent potential future liability from the sale of potentially dangerous drugs,” Judge Higbee said, according to a court transcript. Michael A. Santoro, an associate professor of business ethics at Rutgers Business School, was paid by the plaintiffs to help draft the settlement terms. He told me that he kept in mind Sarbanes-Oxley — the law on auditing accountability and corporate governance that was enacted in the wake of the Enron scandal — as he developed the governance reforms. “I would argue that every company, not only in the pharmaceutical sector, but also in other industries,” he said, “should look at the settlement as a road map for things they need to revise in their own corporate governance.” Last month, another drug maker, Eli Lilly, said in a regulatory filing that it planned to enact corporate reforms to settle shareholder suits that it faces. But some analysts say that these kinds of changes don’t address deeper problems in corporate culture, like errant leadership or obsequious directors, that are factors in many business disasters. After all, they said, Enron’s stringent code of conduct did not prevent accounting fraud. Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, blamed Merck’s previous leadership for Vioxx — the kind of crisis, he said, that corporate governance reform doesn’t preclude. In analyzing the Vioxx crisis in the book “Judgment: How Winning Leaders Make Great Calls,” Mr. Tichy and a co-author take the Merck board to task for hiring a new C.E.O., Raymond V. Gilmartin, in the 1990s. In their book, they say Mr. Gilmartin, a veteran of the medical device industry, didn’t have the right background to run a major pharmaceutical enterprise. In 2005, in the wake of the Vioxx crisis, Mr. Gilmartin resigned from Merck. Mr. Gilmartin had endured a stormy tenure at Merck and when he resigned he said he was leaving because he didn’t want to interfere with the company’s succession planning. (Mr. Gilmartin did not return a phone call and an e-mail message from a reporter seeking comment.) “You can put in all the changes and checks and balances you want,” Mr. Tichy told me, “but if you put in a leader that is not capable of doing the job, the same thing could happen.” Meanwhile, Thomas Donaldson, a professor of corporate governance and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, suggested that drug makers would do better to re-examine their internal reward systems than to enact corporate governance changes that seem divorced from the way the companies really do business. Do certain drug makers highly reward executives when a new drug receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Donaldson asked, without making the same executives take responsibility — and give back their huge paychecks — if a Vioxx-like problem were to develop? INDEED, to former investment bankers like John Gillespie, the co-author of a book on corporate governance called “Money for Nothing,” the Merck settlement agreement seems like pretty small potatoes in the face of such staggering shareholder losses. Moreover, Mr. Gillespie said, because executives concerned about lawsuits are loath to acknowledge any mistakes, it’s almost impossible for companies to take corrective action “beyond window dressing.” “There are some improvements that one hopes would keep the company from repeating problems that they don’t admit occurred,” Mr. Gillespie said of the Merck settlement agreement. As for Mr. Gilmartin, the former Merck chief executive, he is a now a professor of management practice at the Harvard Business School, where he teaches a course called “Building and Sustaining Successful Enterprises.”</text></article>

The Federal Court awarded the amount to Graeme R. Peterson, 59, in a case against Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme (Australia), the plaintiff's law firm, Slater &amp; Gordon, said Friday. The court found that Vioxx contributed to Mr. Peterson's heart attack in 2003, according to the judgment. Merck said in a statement that it would appeal.

With the Millipore acquisition, Merck will become the latest health care company to strike a deal during a period of industrywide consolidation. The takeover will give the German drug maker a big presence in products for the biotechnology industry. Under the terms of the deal, Merck will pay $107 a share in cash, a 13 percent premium to Millipore's closing price of $94.41 on Friday. ''This transaction is very attractive to shareholders, customers and employees of both companies,'' Karl-Ludwig Kley, Merck's chairman, said in a statement. ''This is a combination with an excellent strategic fit.'' Millipore shares have risen more than 34 percent since last week, when news reports said that it had received a $6 billion bid from another company, Thermo Fisher Scientific. Millipore later confirmed that was considering selling itself. Millipore, based in Billerica, Mass., had $1.7 billion in sales last year. It has about 6,000 employees in more than 30 countries. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year. Merck plans to pay for the deal with a mix of cash on hand and loans from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, BNP Paribas and Commerzbank, though it expects to issue bonds to replace some of the bank financing. Merck was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Perella Weinberg Partners and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. Millipore was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firms Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore and Ropes &amp; Gray.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Brendan McDermid/Reuters Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck. The company's cost-cutting goals include elimination of 2,500 vacant jobs. Merck said fourth-quarter net income was $6.5 billion, or $2.35 a share, including about two months of results from Schering-Plough, a merger completed in early November. The results include a big gain tied to the transaction. A year earlier, Merck reported net income of $1.64 billion, or 78 cents a share. Excluding deal-related and other special items, earnings were 79 cents a share, matching analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue was $10.09 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of nearly $9.7 billion. Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, said the company remained firmly committed to its financial targets from the $41 billion Schering deal. This month, Pfizer, which is digesting its own huge takeover of Wyeth, lowered its 2012 financial forecasts as analysts cited unexpectedly high spending. Combined sales of the Merck diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet jumped 43 percent in the fourth quarter to $760 million, even as the products began to face competition from a rival drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Sales of Merck’s Singulair allergy pill rose 12 percent to $1.3 billion. Combined sales of its cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia, which have faced questions over safety and effectiveness, rose about 6 percent to $1.19 billion, helped by strong growth outside the United States. In combining with Schering-Plough, Merck broadened its product portfolio and greatly bolstered its research pipeline. It also expects to achieve major cost savings to help it weather expected generic competition to Singulair and other drugs. Including Schering, Merck had 10 franchises with sales of at least $1 billion last year. Merck continues to aim for a high single-digit compound annual growth rate in earnings per share, excluding items, from 2009 to 2013. The drug maker said it expected to provide its 2010 outlook in April. Merck stood by its previous goal of $3.5 billion in annual cost savings in 2012 as it cuts 15 percent of jobs from the combined company. Merck had about 100,000 employees at the end of the year, and plans to slash about 2,500 vacant positions as part of the initial phase of the cost cuts. Mr. Clark, who reaches the company’s mandatory retirement age of 65 in March 2011, told analysts on the call that Merck was in “pretty good shape” with internal candidates to succeed him as chief executive. Shares of Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 74 cents, or 2 percent, to $37.66 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Resource-related shares were among the strongest gainers as a weaker United States dollar set off buying in oil and other commodities. The CRB commodities index made its largest one-day percentage advance in three months and the energy company Chevron was the top gainer in the Dow industrials, up 2.8 percent, or $1.98, to $72.99. Shares of Merck gained 2 percent, or 74 cents, to $37.66, after it posted quarterly revenue above analysts’ estimates. “Earnings have been strong and people are starting to believe the recovery we’re seeing in the economy is real,” said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. “There’s more of a fear that investors will miss the next move up, as opposed to not being involved and watching the market go down.” The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index resumed weekly gains last Friday after four consecutive weeks of declines that were partly caused by fiscal weakness in Greece and other euro-zone countries as well as uncertainty about China’s moves to curb bank lending. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 169.67 points, or 1.68 percent, to 10,268.81. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index added 19.36 points, or 1.80 percent, to 1,094.87. The Nasdaq composite index gained 30.66 points, or 1.40 percent, to 2,214.19. In another encouraging sign, the New York Federal Reserve Bank’s gauge of manufacturing in New York State rose more than expected in February. Its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 24.91 in February, the highest level since October and up from 15.92 in January. “The U.S. manufacturing sector shows no signs of slowing down in February,” said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York. “The strong number will lead the markets to expect a similar improvement in the Philadelphia Fed index, which will be released Thursday.” Financial stocks rose after Barclays, the British bank, said it nearly doubled profits in 2009 to $18.2 billion. JPMorgan shares climbed 2.9 percent, to $40.07. Shares of the Southern Company gained 2.3 percent, to $31.88, after President Obama announced loan guarantees of $8.3 billion to build the nation’s first nuclear plant in nearly three decades. A Southern subsidiary, Georgia Power, received the guarantees. Simon Property said it had made a $10 billion offer for General Growth Properties, heightening optimism in the battered commercial real estate market with a combination of the two largest shopping mall owners in the nation. Simon shares rose 3.9 percent, to $74.82. On the Nasdaq, shares of the chip maker Intel increased 1.4 percent, to $20.72, after a brokerage firm raised its rating on the stock to a buy.

This pain medication for arthritis became a blockbuster after its introduction in 1999, only to be taken off the market in 2004 when a study linked the drug to an increased risk of heart attack and strokes. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic In Combined Studies, Earlier Warnings A new study published Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine offers an ambitious proposal to determine a drug’s risks sooner than they might otherwise become evident. The authors propose a system to examine widely prescribed drugs through safety analyses that would pool data as they emerge from various clinical trials of a medication and aggregate the information for a fuller picture of a drug’s harms and benefits. As policy makers in Washington push for various forms of evidence gathering to determine the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments, the study proposes a broad model for monitoring drug safety that would consist of detailed publicly available data that independent researchers could freely analyze. Such a database could be continually updated and aggregated with new information, as the results of new studies were published, to calculate a near real-time balance sheet of a drug’s risks and benefits. Dr. Joseph S. Ross, the lead author of the study, said the objective of the researchers was to determine whether this kind of sequential cumulative analysis could serve as a new model for monitoring the safety of drugs after they enter the market. “How could we be doing post-market surveillance in a better way?” said Dr. Ross, an assistant professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. “For drugs that we are concerned about, that are high risk, this could be a blueprint going forward.” Drug makers and researchers regularly conduct studies called meta-analyses in which they aggregate results from some previous studies of a drug, using the combined information to summarize the benefits and risks of a treatment. But the new study proposes a continuously updated model. Using data from Vioxx as their example, the researchers reported that Merck, the drug’s maker, could have known about the increased cardiovascular risk several years earlier if the company had used the methodology. The cumulative analysis of the researchers showed that by May 2002  more than two years before Merck pulled Vioxx off the market  study patients on the drug had a 39 percent increased risk of heart attack or death compared with people taking a placebo. Dr. Ross and his co-authors have each worked as paid consultants to plaintiffs involved in lawsuits against Merck over Vioxx injury claims. The researchers used documents obtained through the litigation, including detailed data from Merck’s Vioxx studies, to conduct their analysis. In a statement Monday, Merck questioned the methodology of the authors, saying that the researchers had used categories that were too broad. The researchers, for example, counted heart attacks and deaths that happened after patients had stopped taking Vioxx. In 2000, a study financed by Merck had reported an increased cardiovascular risk in patients taking Vioxx compared to those taking a pain medication called naproxen. The Food and Drug Administration then asked Merck to add a warning to the drug’s label. But Merck said that the company had conducted its own regularly updated analyses of clinical trial data on Vioxx and had not determined there was a problem until 2004. “Based on our own analyses, we did not see an increase in cardiovascular events with Vioxx compared to a placebo,” Doug Watson, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Merck, said in a phone interview Monday. Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx in 2004, within a week of learning that a clinical trial had found an increased cardiovascular risk with the drug, the statement said. Requiring the kind of constant cumulative analyses for all drugs proposed in the Ross article would require an act of Congress, said Dr. Janet Woodcock, the director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The F.D.A. has stepped up its safety measures since reports of heart problems with Vioxx first surfaced, Dr. Woodcock said. The agency has added staff members in all divisions to monitor drug safety, has strengthened its Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and has instituted a postmarket safety tracking system for new drugs, she said. The agency also regularly conducts its own meta-analyses of drug safety, particularly when there is a signal of a health problem, Dr. Woodcock said. Meanwhile, in 2007, Congress passed an amendment to federal drug law that has given the agency authority to require drug makers to put in place risk management programs for certain drugs and to conduct postmarket safety studies, she said. The amendment also gives the agency the power to order changes to drug labels to reflect new safety information and requires drug makers to make public the results of clinical trials. But some critics said Congress should give the agency more power  and more resources  to provide more detailed drug safety information to doctors and consumers. More information would be helpful, these critics said, because the studies required to gain approval for a new drug are often too short in duration or too small to identify all serious side effects. Sometimes, problems associated with a drug may not become known until it is used over time by several hundreds of thousands of people, they said. “There is this kind of dogma in medicine that you shouldn’t use any drug for the first seven years after it’s released, because it takes that long to figure out its harms and benefits,” said Dr. Michael Steinman, an assistant professor of medicine at the medical school of the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Steinman listed a number of drugs, in addition to Vioxx, that makers removed from the market after reports of health problems: Baycol, a cholesterol-lowering drug taken off the market by Bayer in 2001 after reports of serious muscle problems; Zelnorm, a drug for irritable bowel syndrome, withdrawn by Novartis in 2007 after an analysis of safety data found an increased risk of heart problems; and Bextra, taken off the market by Pfizer in 2005 after reports that the drug could increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Dr. Woodcock said cumulative analyses of the type the Ross article proposes could be useful to check out hypotheses about particular safety problems associated with particular drugs. But there are so many drugs on the market that it would probably be impossible, if not prohibitively expensive, to cumulatively track all of them, said Dr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School. Still, Dr. Antman said it would make sense for the agency to give conditional approval to certain new drugs, requiring drug makers to file cumulative analyses of safety and efficacy data several years later in order to obtain permanent approval.

Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said Monday. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Susan Walsh/Associated Press Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he was concerned that the independence of accounting standards agencies was being compromised by politics. Mr. Volcker has been an outspoken critic of “mark to market” accounting that forced banks to take large write-downs in asset values, a position cited by banks earlier this year when they persuaded members of the House Financial Services Committee to demand changes in that rule. But in an interview Monday, two days before a House committee vote on a proposal that would grant bank regulators the power to sidestep accounting standards, Mr. Volcker said he believed that accounting rules had to be set by an independent agency. He voiced concern that rising political pressures on both sides of the Atlantic were endangering that independence. The Financial Services Committee is to vote on amendments to a bill to establish a council of bank regulators as a systemic risk regulator, able to take action if bank activities threaten financial stability. The amendment, proposed by Representative Ed Perlmutter, Democrat of Colorado, and strongly supported by the banks, would give that group of regulators the power to order the Securities and Exchange Commission, which now oversees the Financial Accounting Standards Board, to suspend or change any accounting rule that the council thinks is a threat to financial stability. The amendment has been endorsed by the American Bankers Association, which says the S.E.C.’s focus, on helping investors, is too narrow. The amendment has been strongly opposed by groups including the Chamber of Commerce and groups representing investors. Leslie Oliver, an aide to Representative Perlmutter, said the congressman was still working on final language of the amendment and expected it to be voted on by the committee on Wednesday. The bankers’ group contends it is clear that accounting standards worsened the crisis, while others argue that the accounting rules belatedly forced the banks, and their regulators, to report on the disastrous results caused by their previous errors. Mr. Volcker was the founding chairman of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, which oversees the International Accounting Standards Board, and has long been a supporter of independent rule-setting. He has been campaigning for a single set of international accounting standards, but he said on Monday that he feared that effort was being undermined. “You have the politicians in Europe influencing it,” he said. “You have the politicians in the U.S. influencing it.” If that continues, he said. “We’re never going to get common standards.” Asked about the Perlmutter amendment, he responded, “That’s a terrible idea.” The I.A.S.B. sets standards that are being adopted in many countries around the world. But it has run into trouble in Europe as some politicians say it has not shown enough deference to the European Commission, which has asserted the right to modify rules issued by the board. The S.E.C. has been weighing whether to allow companies to use international accounting standards in this country, something the accounting industry has advocated. Boards in the United States and abroad have also been working to bring their standards in sync, but both have faced substantial opposition from banks opposed to being forced to show the market value of securities they own.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/business/16drugprices.html?ref=merckandcompany">Drug Makers Raise Prices in Face of Health Care Reform<date>Published: November 15, 2009</date><text>Even as drug makers promise to support Washington’s health care overhaul by shaving $8 billion a year off the nation’s drug costs after the legislation takes effect, the industry has been raising its prices at the fastest rate in years.In the last year, the industry has raised the wholesale prices of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 percent, according to industry analysts. That will add more than $10 billion to the nation’s drug bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year. By at least one analysis, it is the highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since 1992. The drug trend is distinctly at odds with the direction of the Consumer Price Index, which has fallen by 1.3 percent in the last year. Drug makers say they have valid business reasons for the price increases. Critics say the industry is trying to establish a higher price base before Congress passes legislation that tries to curb drug spending in coming years. “When we have major legislation anticipated, we see a run-up in price increases,” says Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota. He has analyzed drug pricing for AARP, the advocacy group for seniors that supports the House health care legislation that the drug industry opposes. A Harvard health economist, Joseph P. Newhouse, said he found a similar pattern of unusual price increases after Congress added drug benefits to Medicare a few years ago, giving tens of millions of older Americans federally subsidized drug insurance. Just as the program was taking effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest margin in a half-dozen years. “They try to maximize their profits,” Mr. Newhouse said. But drug companies say they are having to raise prices to maintain the profits necessary to invest in research and development of new drugs as the patents on many of their most popular drugs are set to expire over the next few years. “Price adjustments for our products have no connection to health care reform,” said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for Merck, which raised its prices about 8.9 percent in the last year, according to a stock analyst’s report. This year’s increases mean the average annual cost for a brand-name prescription drug that is taken daily would be more than $2,000 — $200 higher than last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. And this means that the cost of many popular drugs has risen even faster. Merck, for example, now sells daily 10-milligram pills of Singulair, the blockbuster asthma drug, at a wholesale price of $1,330 a year — $147 more than last year. Singulair is now selling at retail, on drugstore.com, for nearly $1,478 a year. The drug companies “can charge what they want — it’s not fair,” Eric White, the 42-year-old owner of a small jewelry store in Queens, said as he left a pharmacy recently. Despite having drug insurance, Mr. White says he now pays $110 a month out of pocket for two brand-name allergy medicines, even as he has cut prices in his jewelry store by at least 40 percent to keep customers coming through the door. He shook his head. “What can I do?” he said. “I need my medicines.” The drug industry has actively opposed some of the cost-cutting provisions in the House legislation, which passed Nov. 7 and aims to cut drug spending by about $14 billion a year over a decade. But the drug makers have been proudly citing the agreement they reached with the White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman to trim $8 billion a year — $80 billion over 10 years — from the nation’s drug bill by giving rebates to older Americans and the government. That provision is likely to be part of the legislation that will reach the Senate floor in coming weeks. But this year’s price increases would effectively cancel out the savings from at least the first year of the Senate Finance agreement. And some critics say the surge in drug prices could change the dynamics of the entire 10-year deal. “It makes it much easier for the drug companies to pony up the $80 billion because they’ll be making more money,” said Steven D. Findlay, senior health care analyst with the advocacy group Consumers Union. Name-brand prices have risen even as prices of widely used generic drugs have fallen by about 9 percent in the last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. But name brands account for 78 percent of total prescription drug spending in this country. And as long as a name-brand drug still has patent protection it faces no price competition from generics. Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the industry association — the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America — criticized the analysis Professor Schondelmeyer had conducted for AARP, saying it was politically motivated. “In AARP’s skewed view of the world, medicines are always looked at as a cost and never seen as a savings — even though medicines often reduce unnecessary hospitalization, help avoid costly medical procedures and increase productivity through better prevention and management of chronic diseases,” he said.</text></article>

The results of the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, were presented here Sunday night at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association. The study has been a polarizing topic here and has also attracted the attention of a powerful senator who has been investigating the conduct of two drug makers, Merck and Schering-Plough, in relation to their sales and marketing of Zetia and a combination cholesterol drug, Vytorin, which includes Zetia. The drug makers merged this month. The small study, with only 208 patients, has attracted outsize attention because the researchers did a head-to-head comparison of niacin and Zetia, which has been heavily marketed. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zetia in 2002 to lower bad cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease. But the drug has not yet proved to have a longer-term clinical benefit in reducing heart attacks and deaths. Merck, the maker of the drug, is conducting a clinical trial on that issue involving up to 18,000 patients. Statins like Lipitor have proved in studies to significantly lower the risk of heart attack. Some cardiologists here hailed the study as an indication that the popularity of Zetia and Vytorin, which had combined sales last year of about $4.6 billion, has far outstripped their evidence of a concrete benefit on heart health. Other doctors here dismissed the study because it did not directly measure the drugs' effects on reducing heart attacks. Nevertheless, this study has the potential to make big waves in the use of cholesterol drugs. ''It will certainly strengthen the idea that, after you give a statin, the weight of the evidence is that, as a second agent, you should give niacin,'' said Dr. Roger S. Blumenthal, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School. ''That is the implication of the study.'' But Dr. Peter S. Kim, the president of Merck Research Laboratories, said Sunday in an interview that the study was limited because it did not compare the groups of patients taking a statin and a second drug to a placebo group. Furthermore, he said, a drug's ability to improve artery-wall thickness has not been proved to automatically correlate with a reduction in heart attacks. Zetia, he said, lowers bad cholesterol and lowering bad cholesterol is a known good. The study results ''should be compared to the overwhelming body of evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol is an important thing to do to improve cardiovascular health,'' Dr. Kim said. The study randomly assigned patients who were taking a statin and who had heart disease or a risk of heart disease to additionally take either Zetia or Niaspan. Statins are a class of drug which lowers LDL, known as bad cholesterol because it can cause arterial thickening and lead to heart problems. The drugs work by inhibiting the production of cholesterol in the liver. Zetia, which inhibits the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines, lowers bad cholesterol. Niaspan is a prescription extended-release form of niacin, not the over-the-counter vitamin. Niacin increases HDL, known as ''good cholesterol.'' Niaspan is made by Abbott Laboratories, which financed the study. Over the course of the 14-month study, the bad cholesterol of the patients on Zetia decreased by 19.2 percent, but the patients' arterial wall thickness stayed the same, the study said. In the niacin group, good cholesterol increased by 18.4 percent and the carotid wall thickness decreased. By itself, the study does not have major significance, said Dr. James H. Stein, a professor at the University of Wisconsin medical school. But taken in the context of more than 30 years of research on and use of niacin, he said, the study adds to the weight of evidence that it can a great benefit to patients with heart disease, he said. ''Compare that to Zetia where there is not a shred of evidence that it does anything good for blood vessels or heart disease,'' Dr. Stein said. On Friday, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote to the Department of Health and Human Services, asking its director, Kathleen Sebelius, what action she intended to take in light of the study results. Mr. Grassley sits on the Senate Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over Medicare and its drug spending. In 2006 and 2007, the drug makers made more than $300 million through Medicare Part D in sales of Vytorin, a drug that combines Zetia and a statin, Mr. Grassley wrote. In response to a query from a reporter, a Merck spokesman said the small trial did not change the company's belief in the demonstrated ability of Zetia and Vytorin to reduce bad cholesterol.</text></article>

A junket to SeaWorld it is not. Skip to next paragraph Daniel Rosenbaum for The New York Times Dr. Allen J. Taylor of Washington Hospital Center. For top analysts from investment banks, including JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, or some of their minions, the destination is a cardiology conference where on Monday morning medical researchers are expected to present a study with potentially significant implications for multibillion-dollar cholesterol medications from the drug giant Merck. The new study, to be released Monday at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association, is relatively small, involving only about 200 people. That could limit its significance. But analysts are paying rapt attention to the report because two previous studies reduced sales of the drugs after indicating that they may not work any better than cholesterol drugs known as statins that are widely available as inexpensive generics. Analysts are waiting to see whether the new study reinforces the earlier findings or, perhaps, makes matters even worse for Merck. The study represents the first major news event, or catalyst in investor jargon, that could affect Merck earnings after the $41.1 billion merger the company completed last week with Schering-Plough. At stake are sales of Vytorin and Zetia, two cholesterol-lowering drugs that, even with the coming study factored in, are projected to bring in $4.5 billion in revenue for Merck in 2012, according to estimates from Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse. She forecast that in 2012, the cholesterol drugs would represent about $3 billion in profits, or about 17 percent of Merck’s projected total pretax profits of $17.4 billion. “This franchise is important from an earnings standpoint and a strategic standpoint,” Ms. Arnold said. “It wasn’t the crux of the merger of the two companies, but it was clearly a franchise both were interested in.” After the previous two studies raised questions about the drugs, sales of Vytorin and Zetia decreased to about $4.56 billion in 2008, compared with about $5.19 billion in 2007, according to a company regulatory filing. The decline occurred primarily in United States sales of the drugs. “It’s been such a controversial franchise that any bit of incremental data is going to get a lot of attention from the financial community,” said Chris Schott, an analyst with JPMorgan. In a note sent to investors this week, Mr. Schott estimated that, if the forthcoming study were to cause a sales drop in the cholesterol drugs, for every 10 percent reduction in American sales, earnings would drop by roughly 5 cents a share. Cholesterol medications have been a lucrative market for drug makers. But Zetia, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, has been controversial because it uses a different mechanism of action than statins, which have a longer track record. Vytorin, approved by the agency in 2004, is a medication that combines Zetia and a statin in one drug. Statins, like the world’s best-selling drug Lipitor from Pfizer, are drugs that work by inhibiting the production of LDL cholesterol in the liver. LDL is known as bad cholesterol because it can lead to plaque build-up in the arteries. Large-scale prospective studies have shown that statins can lower bad cholesterol and decrease heart problems. Zetia works by a different route, reducing bad cholesterol by blocking its absorption in the intestines. Taking Zetia alone typically lowers bad cholesterol by 18 percent, Merck said. But while Zetia has been shown to reduce bad cholesterol, it has not yet been proved to provide increased protection against problems like heart attacks and strokes, as statins have. Merck is currently conducting a large-scale clinical trial, that is to involve 18,000 people, intended to determine whether using Zetia provides an added cardiovascular benefit to people already on a statin. But the study is not expected to be completed until at least 2012. Dr. Richard Pasternak, vice president of Merck research laboratories, said that the drugs had proved to be safe and effective. It would be unfortunate, he said, if doctors were to change clinical practice based on unfair speculation about a study of 200 patients. The results of two earlier studies, intended to measure the effect of the drugs on problems like arterial wall thickening, an issue linked to heart problems, suggested that adding Zetia did not increase the cardiovascular benefit for patients. The new study is sure to further stoke the debate over whether, in the absence of definitive data, doctors should continue to prescribe expensive brand name drugs like Zetia and Vytorin, instead of inexpensive generic statins. “It was very unfortunate that this drug was introduced and became very popular without a large, well-designed study to look at whether it could reduce cardiovascular events,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. The new study was intended to examine the potential benefits of adding a second drug  either Zetia or niacin  to the treatment regime of people already taking a statin. Niacin can increase HDL cholesterol, known as good cholesterol because it is believed to scavenge bad cholesterol and remove it from the body. Researchers measured the differences in changes to arterial wall thickness in the two groups. “If you’re going to go to the expense, risk and trouble to take a pill every day to improve your longevity, don’t you really want to know if it works?” said Dr. Allen J. Taylor, a cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, in Washington, who led the study. He said he could not talk about the results until Monday. Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with the investment bank Leerink Swann, said he expected the study to favor niacin. But Mr. Schott of JPMorgan predicted that the fallout from the study  and, consequently, the impact on Merck’s bottom line  would be limited.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Michael Appleton for The New York Times Shirley Boles took Mercks Fosamax from 1997 to 2006. Multimedia Interactive Graphic Documents: Fosamax Products Liability Litigation One juror even reported being threatened by others for failing to agree. In the case in United States District Court in Manhattan, a 71-year-old retired deputy sheriff from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., Shirley Boles, contended that taking Fosamax from 1997 to 2006 cause her jawbone tissue to die. Millions of women have taken Fosamax, made by Merck, to offset bone loss associated with menopause. During the trial, lawyers for Mrs. Boles used expert witnesses, reports in medical journals and internal company documents to bolster their argument that Merck knew or should have known that Fosamax can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw, or jawbone death. Lawyers for Merck countered with reports and witnesses to support their argument that the drug does not cause osteonecrosis of the jaw and that Mrs. Boles had other health issues that caused her jaw problems. Pharmaceutical industry executives and lawyers have been closely monitoring the trial as a bellwether for hundreds of other similar lawsuits against Merck. Last week, Judge John F. Keenan asked jurors to decide whether Merck had been negligent in formulating the drug, whether the company failed to warn doctors of a known risk of the product, whether Fosamax was defective, and, if so, whether any of those situations directly caused her injury. But if the notes to the judge from the jurors are any indication, the case suggests that lawyers for the plaintiffs will have difficulty proving that Fosamax directly caused injuries to their clients. “It tells you something important,” Paul Strain, the lead lawyer for Merck, said in a phone interview on Friday. “It’s very easy to make an accusation, but it is very hard for them to prove their accusations against this drug.” At the end of June, Merck was facing about 900 Fosamax cases brought in state and federal courts across the country, according to a company regulatory filing. Mr. Strain said Merck intended to try each one. Timothy O’Brien, the lead lawyer for Mrs. Boles, offered a different interpretation of the deadlocked jurors. “From the common-sense perspective, this trial really showed that it provoked juror passions,” Mr. O’Brien said in an interview on Friday. “This is the most contentious deliberation I have ever been part of. Obviously, it got us to the point that Merck didn’t win.” Mr. O’Brien said there were about 1,200 Fosamax cases against Merck. His firm represents about 400 Fosamax plaintiffs, he said. Many of the Fosamax cases have been consolidated before Judge Keenan to establish common legal and evidentiary issues. The Boles v. Merck trial began on Aug. 12. The jury of five women and three men began deliberations on Sept. 2. A week later, they were sending desperate pleas to the judge. “Judge Keenan,” juror No. 7 wrote in a note logged into evidence midday Tuesday, “it’s very stressful to sit here.” Deliberations became more fraught for one juror on Wednesday. “Dear Judge Keenan,” juror No. 5 wrote, “I am being intimidated, threatened, screamed at as well as verbally insulted that I am stupid because I do not agree.” Also on Wednesday, jurors No. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 sent their own collective note to the judge complaining about a holdout. On the issue of whether the drug directly caused injury to Mrs. Boles, the jurors wrote to the judge in capital letters: “One of the jurors is still not following your charge.” That juror contended, the others wrote, that foreknowledge by Merck about a risk from Fosamax constituted enough proof that the drug caused the injury to Mrs. Boles. But, the jurors wrote, referring to their colleague in the gender-neutral plural: “They agree that there is no evidence of proof that Fosamax caused Mrs. Boles injury.” Judge Keenan gave jurors Thursday off to try to cool their emotions. When they were still deadlocked on Friday, he declared a mistrial. He is scheduled to try two other Fosamax cases next year, trials which lawyers from each side said they plan to use to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments. Mr. O’Brien, the lawyer for Mrs. Boles, said that Judge Keenan planned to retry her case next spring. Mr. Strain, the lawyer for Merck, said he planned to file a motion to have that case dismissed, arguing that no jury would be able to find in favor of Mrs. Boles, given the evidence. Shares of Merck rose 58 cents, to $32.54, on Friday.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Abbott Laboratories Go to your Portfolio » Although advances in drug regimens since the 1990s have added nearly 20 years to the average life expectancy of a person with H.I.V./AIDS, the report card graded the drug makers overall with a below-average C-minus and recommended improvements. “There’s an opportunity now to kick it up a notch,” said Bob Huff, antiretroviral treatment director of the Treatment Action Group in New York and a board member of the rating group. Twenty-one members of the AIDS Treatment Activists Coalition, a nonprofit group formed in 2001, researched the drug companies, interviewed executives and assigned grades assessing performance over the last quarter century, Mr. Huff said. The companies were scored on research and development, pricing, patient assistance programs, marketing, and community relations. More than one million people in the United States are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, though only about half of them have been discovered and treated, the government says. Untreated, H.I.V./AIDS leaves people vulnerable to infections and cancers. While treatment reduces symptoms and extends life, there is no cure. The report gave its highest grade, a B, to Merck, for producing Isentress, the first of a new class of AIDS drugs called integrase inhibitors. It also praised Merck for freezing prices for lower income users. Isentress, approved in 2007, is already used by 11 percent of the more than 550,000 people treated in the United States, Michael S. Seggev, a spokesman for Merck, said Wednesday. “We’re very pleased to have achieved the highest grade on the report card,” he said. “They’re the most respected and most representative coalition of H.I.V. community groups in the U.S., so their opinion is very meaningful.” The group gave an F to Abbott for raising the wholesale price of Norvir, the first drug proved to increase survival in AIDS patients, by 400 percent in 2003. Norvir is a key ingredient in most AIDS treatment cocktails. The price increaes provoked an outcry by many patients and others. An Abbott spokesman, Dirk van Eeden, responded Wednesday, “The H.I.V. community is an important stakeholder for us, so yes, we do take notice of the comments they make.” He added, “We really believe we’ve discovered important medicines and played our part in making sure the patients who need it can get it.” Other grades included a B for Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, owned by Johnson and Johnson as a separate company focusing on infectious diseases; C-plus for Pfizer, which announced in April a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to spin off a company focused on H.I.V.; C-plus for Gilead Sciences; C-minus grades for Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline, both criticized for high prices; a D-plus for Boehringer Ingelheim; and a D for Hoffman LaRoche, which the coalition said has the most expensive drug on the market. Representatives for Pfizer, Gilead and Boehringer responded Wednesday that they valued the group’s opinion and continued their work in AIDS. Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline officials each said they were “disappointed” and deserved better grades. Other companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The coalition was to some degree biting the hand that feeds it. It receives all of its financing from drug companies, mostly for activists to travel to meetings with them. The executive director, Edward T. Rewolinski, disclosed specific amounts to The New York Times for the last two years. “None of our members has the wherewithal to afford this activity,” he said. “People like that would never be influenced by the flow of money,” Jennifer Flynn, managing director of an unrelated AIDS group, Health GAP, in New York, said. The top fund provider was Gilead with $100,000, followed by Pfizer, $63,000; Bristol-Myers Squibb, $50,000; Tibotec, $45,000; Merck, $15,000; and Boehringer, $5,000. Abbott gave no money. Mr. Huff said the grading group was insulated from financing requests. “There’s no sugarcoating,” he said. “The membership feels that the pharmaceutical industry can be doing a much better job, whether it’s innovation or pricing.” The coalition was formed in 2001 partly to coordinate contacts with drug companies instead of letting the industry decide whom to invite to meetings.

Vaccine Market<date>Published: September 10, 2009</date><text>Two pharmaceutical giants are vying for the billions of dollars up for grabs in the market for vaccines against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Merck, which has had a monopoly on HPV vaccines in the United States with its Gardasil for young women, has asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug to protect against genital warts in young men. In 2006, the agency approved Gardasil to protect girls and women ages 9 to 26 against certain strains of the virus that can cause genital warts, pre-cancerous genital lesions and cervical cancer. Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline, which currently markets its Cervarix vaccine to young women in about 100 countries, is seeking to have the vaccine approved in the United States to protect girls and women ages 10 to 25 against certain HPV strains that can cause cervical cancer. Cervarix does not offer protection against strains of the virus that can cause genital warts. On Wednesday, an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration voted that research data from Glaxo had demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Cervarix to protect young women against cervical cancer. The panel, composed of outside experts, also voted in favor of the safety and efficacy of Gardasil to inhibit genital warts in boys and men ages 9 to 26. The F.D.A. typically follows the recommendations of such panels on drug approvals. Glaxo shares were up about half a percent to $39.22 at the end of trading on Wednesday; shares of Merck were up about 1.9 percent to $31.55. But industry analysts said that the drug companies faced a battle to expand the target audience in America for such vaccines because the drugs have limited effectiveness and unknown duration. They also have possible side effects like dizziness and fainting. Both vaccines also require a series of three shots over six months. Both are most protective in young people who have not yet been exposed to the virus because they are either not sexually active or have just become sexually active and have had few romantic partners. Indeed, because of the limited audience of young women, American sales of Gardasil have recently stalled, said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. In the first half of this year, Gardasil had sales in the United States of $363 million, a decrease of 34 percent compared with the same period in 2008, according to a Merck financial statement. Mr. Anderson said that Merck will find it harder to persuade parents and health insurers to pay for Gardasil shots to reduce the chance of developing a nonfatal condition like genital warts in boys than to market the vaccine to reduce a potentially deadly disease like cervical cancer in young women. ''You are asking a healthy teen to come to the doctor three times in six months,'' Mr. Anderson said in an interview Wednesday. ''Pretty much no healthy teen would ever do that, let alone to come back and get a shot, a shot that can cause a lot of pain.'' In a note to investors on Friday, Mr. Anderson forecast that in 2015, Gardasil would have 65 percent of an estimated $3.7 billion worldwide market for vaccines against the human papilloma virus, with Cervarix accounting for the rest. If the agency ultimately approves Cervarix for use in young women, Glaxo will have to distinguish the drug as a longer-lasting and more comprehensive vaccine to gain a foothold in the United States market owned by Merck, analysts said. Since the advent in the 1950s of the Pap test to detect precancerous cells in the cervix, death rates from cervical cancer in the United States have dropped by about 70 percent, said Dr. Debbie Saslow, the director of breast and gynecological cancers at the American Cancer Society. An estimated 11,000 women in the United States will develop invasive cervical cancer this year and about 4,000 women will die from the disease, most of whom have never had a pap test, Dr. Saslow said. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Gardasil to protect against two strains of the virus, 6 and 11, which can cause genital warts, as well as two strains, 16 and 18, which are responsible for the development of about 70 percent of cervical cancers. Now, Glaxo has submitted data to the agency, suggesting that its vaccine also provided cross-protection against several other strains responsible in total for about 86 percent of cervical cancers, the company said. ''Cervarix will prevent more cancers and save more lives than a vaccine without cross protection,'' Dr. Barbara Howe, director of North American vaccine development for Glaxo, told the F.D.A. panel on Wednesday. But an F.D.A. expert told the panel that it was difficult to measure protection against addition strains that cause cervical cancer. The panel also examined safety questions about whether Cervarix could increase a woman's risk of miscarriage or of autoimmune diseases, rare problems which Glaxo said it would follow in post-marketing studies. Merck is also hoping for approval from the F.D.A. to protect boys and young men against the strains of the virus that can cause venereal warts. But, although the F.D.A. panelists voted that Merck had demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Gardasil for boys, skepticism among a few panelists suggested that Merck may find it difficult to persuade boys to have shots for an uncomfortable but non-life-threatening problem that often resolves itself without medical intervention.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/business/03drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">High Stakes for Merck in Litigation on Fosamax<date>Published: September 2, 2009</date><text>Drug executives, product liability lawyers and Wall Street analysts are closely watching a jury trial in New York over medical problems associated with Fosamax, a drug from Merck that has been taken by millions of women to offset the bone loss associated with menopause. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Michael Appleton for The New York Times Shirley Boles, 71, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., claims that taking Fosamax caused her jawbone tissue to die. The jury in her case, which is being closely watched, has begun deliberations. It is the first of about 900 state and federal cases pending against Merck in which plaintiffs claim that taking Fosamax caused them to develop a rare problem called osteonecrosis of the jaw. Dental surgery is one of the triggers for the condition that can break down jawbone tissue, causing the gums to fall away and expose bone that looks moth-eaten, oral surgeons said. In the first case against Merck, which began last month in a United States District Court in Manhattan, Shirley Boles, a 71-year-old retired deputy sheriff from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., alleges that taking Fosamax from 1997 to 2006 caused her jawbone tissue to die. The problem developed after she had tooth extraction in 2002, leaving her with ongoing medical problems that include infections that drain through open wounds in her chin. United States District Judge John F. Keenan is presiding over this case and several hundred other lawsuits from many districts, consolidated in New York to establish common issues in the litigation. A jury of three men and five women began deliberating the case on Wednesday afternoon. Compared with other drug product liability cases that have involved many thousands of plaintiffs, the Fosamax litigation is relatively small. But because Merck is trying to complete a $41 billion merger with Schering-Plough, industry analysts are closely watching this first trial to gauge Merck’s potential financial liability. Merck spent $7 million in the second quarter of this year on legal expenses in the case and has set aside $42 million to defend itself in about 900 federal and state Fosamax cases brought by about 1,280 plaintiff groups, according to a company regulatory filing at the end of June. Timothy O’Brien, the lead lawyer for Mrs. Boles, said that an updated number would be closer to 1,200 pending cases. His law firm represents about 400 Fosamax plaintiffs, he said. Meanwhile, other drug companies and plaintiffs’ lawyers expecting to try similar cases involving related bone drugs have been closely monitoring the case to see which arguments resonate with the jury. Merck’s main defense is that there is no definitive medical evidence proving that Fosamax causes jawbone death and that Mrs. Boles had other health factors that could have caused her jaw problems. Meanwhile, Mr. O’Brien, the lawyer for Mrs. Boles, has been using the case to put Fosamax itself on trial, contending that Merck as a corporation put patients at risk by overpromoting Fosamax and by not warning doctors who prescribe the drug about the potential for jawbone disintegration. The trial began Aug. 12. Mr. O’Brien has presented internal Merck e-mail messages, company documents and case reports from medical journals to bolster his case that Merck knew about jaw problems associated with Fosamax and did not study the problem or warn doctors about it in a timely fashion. Merck contends that the company became aware of the problem only in late 2003 after the first case report associating bisphosphonates with jaw injuries appeared in a medical journal. According to evidence in the case, the company subsequently assembled a panel of doctors to review reports it had received and determine which cases were likely to be osteonecrosis of the jaw. The Food and Drug Administration approved Fosamax in 1995 to treat the bone loss of osteoporosis associated with menopause. In 1997, the agency approved the drug to prevent osteoporosis itself. Until the recent introduction of branded and generic competitors for the osteoporosis drug market, Fosamax was one of the most popular drugs in the United States. Doctors in the United States wrote about 2.6 million prescriptions for the drug last year, which was down from more than 15 million prescriptions in 2007, according to annual reports from Drug Topics, an industry magazine. Fosamax had global sales of $1.55 billion last year, a decrease of almost 50 percent compared with 2007, according to a Merck financial statement. On Wednesday afternoon, Judge Keenan asked the jury to decide several questions: Was Merck negligent in formulating Fosamax? Did the company fail to warn Mrs. Boles’s doctor of a known risk of the drug? Is Fosamax a defective product? And, if the jury answers yes to any of those questions, did that circumstance legally cause Mrs. Boles’s jawbone problems? 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 3, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E2DF1F31F93AA2575BC0A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=merckandcompany">Study on Vaccine for Cervical Cancer Finds Benefits Despite Some Risks<date>Published: August 19, 2009</date><text>The new vaccine designed to protect girls and young women from cervical cancer has a safety record that appears to be in line with that of other vaccines, a government report has found. Some serious complications occurred, including at least 20 deaths and two cases of Lou Gehrig's disease, but they were not necessarily caused by the vaccine, the study said. The most common serious complications after vaccination with Gardasil were fainting episodes and an increased risk for potentially fatal blood clots, possibly related to oral contraceptive use and obesity, the study found. The vaccine has been given to more than seven million girls and young women nationwide and there is no way to prove that complications came from the vaccine. But while the tone of the study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, was reassuring, the authors noted that the analysis was based on imperfect data drawn from reports made to a voluntary government surveillance database. The majority of adverse event reports were filed by Merck &amp; Company, the vaccine's manufacturer, and most failed to provide enough information for further investigation. ''We feel confident recommending people get the vaccine; the benefits still outweigh the risks,'' said Dr. Barbara A. Slade, the study's first author and medical officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which did the study together with the Food and Drug Administration. She added, ''This is the most complete picture we have.'' Nevertheless, an accompanying editorial questioned whether any level of risk is acceptable when inoculating a healthy population against a disease that can be prevented through screening. ''There are not a huge number of side effects here, that's fairly certain,'' said the editorial writer, Dr. Charlotte Haug, an infectious disease expert from Norway, about the vaccine. ''But you are giving this to perfectly healthy young girls, so even a rare thing may be too much of a risk. ''I wouldn't accept much risk of side effects at all in an 11-year-old girl, because if she gets screened when she's older, she'll never get cervical cancer,'' Dr. Haug said in an interview. ''You don't have to die from cervical cancer if you have access to health care.'' The vaccine was approved for girls and young women ages 9 to 26 and is recommended for routine vaccination of girls 11 and 12. Merck officials said they were pleased with the findings of the new report. ''This confirms the very favorable safety profile we've seen in our extensive clinical trials,'' said Dr. Richard M. Haupt, executive director of clinical research for Merck Research Laboratories, adding that while screening is important, the vaccine can reduce the number of abnormal results and procedures, because it prevents infection with four strains of HPV, including two implicated in most cases of cervical cancer today. ''Pap screening alone is not the answer,'' Dr. Haupt said. Another paper in JAMA described how Merck, whose sales of Gardasil totaled $1.4 billion last year, provided professional medical societies with grant money the organizations used to develop educational programs promoting the product. The lectures glossed over questions about the vaccine's effectiveness and whether booster shots would be needed, said Sheila M. Rothman, the paper's author. ''The message they were giving was really the drug company message,'' said Dr. Rothman, professor of sociomedical sciences at Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia. The marketing strategy overstated the risks of cervical cancer for American women, she said. ''It was being marketed as if every girl were at equal risk for this disease and needed this vaccine, even though cervical cancer is not a disease of all women in the U.S. -- it particularly affects girls who don't have access to health care and Pap tests,'' Dr. Rothman said. The study on adverse events analyzed 12,424 reports of adverse events that occurred after immunization with the HPV vaccine from June 1, 2006, to Dec. 31, 2008, when more than 23 million doses of vaccine were distributed, enough to vaccinate more than seven million girls with all three required doses. That was calculated as a rate of 53.9 adverse event reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for every 100,000 doses of vaccine distributed. Syncope, or fainting, occurred most frequently, with a rate of 8.2 reports per 100,000 vaccine doses, followed by 7.5 per 100,000 for local site reactions and 6.8 per 100,000 for dizziness. Report rates were then compared with those of other vaccines given in similar populations of girls the same age, Dr. Slade explained. Of the total number of reports, 6.2 percent, or 772 reports, were considered serious events, including 32 reports of death. Only 20 of the deaths could be verified; the others included four that were provided by the manufacturer without further information, and eight secondhand reports that could not be verified. Of the 20, 14 of the deceased had only received the HPV vaccine, while others had received multiple vaccines. The average age of the girls who died was 18, and causes of death varied widely -- including two cases of diabetic ketoacidosis, one case related to prescription drug abuse, one case of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease, one case of meningoencephalitis, three pulmonary embolisms or blood clots to the lung, six cardiac-related deaths, one case of sepsis related to influenza B and two because of seizure disorders. Four deaths were unexplained. Dr. Slade said the disparate causes of death made it difficult to determine an underlying cause, or to determine if the vaccine played a causal role. ''We didn't see any patterns in the causes of death, any pattern in the time between vaccination and death, or the age of the people who died -- there just didn't seem to be any real pattern that would cause us to have heightened concern,'' Dr. Slade said, adding that the number of deaths was ''actually very similar to what we see after other vaccines in similar age groups.'' She said the A.L.S. cases were being investigated further.</text></article>

The companies came under intense scrutiny in January 2008 after they released a study  completed nearly two years earlier  that showed that the medicines, the work of a joint venture, were no more effective in unclogging arteries than a pre-existing and less expensive cholesterol treatment. Sales of Vytorin slumped 23 percent in 2008 after the data was released. Its makers suffered further damage when a second study linked the drugs to potentially harmful side effects, including cancer. The settlement resolves more than 140 claims filed by consumers and insurers who bought, used or paid money toward the purchase of Vytorin and Zetia. The consumer settlements require court approval. In July, the companies agreed to a separate $5.4 million payment to the attorneys general of 35 states and the District of Columbia for costs incurred in investigating consumer-protection cases involving the drugs. Merck and Schering-Plough continued to defend their drugs’ efficacy and safety and did not acknowledge any wrongdoing or liability as part of the settlement. Merck’s general counsel, Bruce N. Kuhlik, said the settlement allowed the companies to avoid mounting legal costs. The Vytorin settlement punctuates a recent period of intense legal activity for the two companies. They are in the middle of a $41.1 billion merger expected to create the world’s second-largest pharmaceutical company by the end of the year under the Merck name. But the companies’ management, facing the prospect of litigation from shareholders opposed to the deal, announced in late July their intention to reach an agreement out of court.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Reed Elsevier N.V Go to your Portfolio » But news of a Merck-sponsored publication for doctors in Australia, that has come to light in a personal injury lawsuit there over Vioxx, has raised eyebrows in international medical publishing. From 2002 through 2005, the Australian affiliate of Merck paid the Australian office of Elsevier, an academic publisher, to publish eight compilations of scientific articles under the title Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine, a spokesman for Elsevier said. The Merck marketing compilation was unusual in that it looked like an independent peer-reviewed medical journal. It even called itself a “journal,” without indicating in any of the issues that Merck had paid for it. “I believe that many doctors reviewing the journal would likely believe it to be a peer-reviewed medical journal, and rely upon the contents as they would upon other journals they read,” said Robert J. Donovan, an expert witness for the plaintiff, according to a deposition statement. Mr. Donovan, a professor of social marketing at the Curtin Business School at Curtin University of Technology in Western Australia, said that while some of the articles did appear to be reprinted from actual peer-reviewed publications, the origins of others was unclear. The Merck-sponsored publication is among the evidence in the Australian trial in which the lead plaintiff in a class action suit alleges, among other things, that the company used misleading and deceptive marketing strategies in promoting Vioxx. Nine of 29 articles in the second issue of the journal referred positively to Vioxx, and an additional 12 articles referred positively to another Merck drug, Fosamax, a bone treatment, Mr. Donovan said. An Australian physician, Dr. James V. Bertouch, testified on May 8 that he had been surprised to find his name listed in the first issue without his permission as a member of the journal’s editorial board, and had asked to have his named removed from the publication. Elsevier issued a statement last week acknowledging that its Australian office had created paid-for compilations “that were made to look like medical journals and lacked the proper disclosures” of their drug company sponsors and calling such practices “unacceptable.” A company spokesman said Elsevier believed that one of the Merck issues was distributed to 20,000 doctors in Australia while other issues went to about 10,000 doctors. In a statement, Merck said that the articles had been reprinted from peer-reviewed journals. Such journals routinely include articles about research sponsored by companies. Merck also said that it agreed with Elsevier about the importance of appropriate disclosure of financial support. Later issues of the journal carried a disclaimer that the publication primarily contained company-sponsored articles, Merck said. A 2004 issue of the journal, obtained by a reporter, acknowledged company-sponsored articles. The disclaimer, however, did not name the company. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Joe Armao/Fairfax Media Graeme Peterson is a plaintiff in the suit against Merck. Related Merck Paid for Medical Journal Without Disclosure (May 14, 2009) The revelations in court testimony and defense evidence include accusations that Merck’s Australian affiliate circulated a marketing publication in the guise of an independent medical journal for doctors and countered safety concerns by giving its sales representatives a training manual called the “Vioxx Objection Handling Module.” Australian newspapers have been covering the court proceedings in daily installments like a soap opera  with headlines like “Drug Representatives for Merck &amp; Co. Given ‘Cheatsheets’ ” and cliffhangers like “the trial continues.” Merck removed the drug from the global market over safety concerns in 2004. Compared with the $4.85 billion Merck agreed to pay in the United States two years ago to settle with nearly 50,000 people who claimed cardiovascular injuries from Vioxx, legal experts say, the company’s potential liability in Australia is a pittance. Even the Australian plaintiff’s lawyer in charge of the case against Merck in Melbourne says the best outcome for his side  a favorable decision for several thousand plaintiffs who could potentially join the case  might cost Merck only several hundred million dollars. That is why, on this side of the Pacific, industry observers are asking themselves why Merck would want to go through another embarrassing airing of dirty linen. “How much money can Merck be saving on the payouts that would be worth this kind of bad publicity years later?” said Michael A. Santoro, an associate professor at Rutgers Business School who teaches a course on pharmaceutical industry ethics. But Merck says the issue is not potential liability or negative publicity. The point of trying the case is to stand behind the company’s conviction that it acted responsibly in developing, marketing, and ultimately withdrawing Vioxx, Bruce N. Kuhlik, Merck’s general counsel, said in an interview this week. With plaintiffs’ lawyers in countries including Canada closely watching the Melbourne trial, Mr. Kuhlik said, Merck was using the same legal strategy it used in the United States: to fight every personal injury case in court and convince judges that patients with idiosyncratic medical histories should not be allowed to sue as a group. Often, he said, individual plaintiffs cannot prove that they used Vioxx or that the drug caused their health problems. Merck took Vioxx off the market in more than 80 countries in 2004, after a clinical trial indicated that the drug could raise the risk of strokes and heart attacks. But Merck, in winning most of the cases to reach juries in this country before agreeing to its big settlement, has consistently argued that there is no proof of a causal link between Vioxx and any one patient’s heart problems. The company said at the time of the settlement that judges had encouraged both sides to come to terms. In the Melbourne trial, which began March 30 and is expected to continue through June, an Australian named Graeme Peterson says that taking Vioxx caused him to have a heart attack in 2003. The plaintiff also accuses Merck of using deceptive and misleading marketing strategies to promote Vioxx. The judge in the case will determine whether Mr. Peterson’s claims can be applied generally to other members of the class-action group. The defense, which began presenting its case on May 4, plans to introduce evidence showing that Merck extensively studied the safety of Vioxx, that Merck Australia’s marketing was consistent with that study data, and that Mr. Peterson’s heart attack resulted from pre-existing conditions, according to a news release from Merck Australia But whether or not Merck prevails, the trial has already attracted relentless news and blog coverage of the plaintiffs’ evidence  nearly 600 documents of which were obtained by The New York Times  which detail Merck’s efforts to woo doctors to the side of Vioxx. Even before introducing Vioxx in Australia in 1999, Merck’s Australian affiliate began to create an arthritis advisory board of influential physicians whose ostensible purpose was to educate the medical community about painkillers. An internal e-mail message that is included in the plaintiff’s evidence, however, describes the board’s unofficial purpose as priming those chosen doctors to “accept the data and positioning of Vioxx” and “publicly state that Vioxx is superior.” Other documents indicate the company sought to teach employees to quell doctors’ concerns, as various studies emerged, that Vioxx could increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks. For example, the company started in 2001 to issue a series of training manuals for sales representatives called “Vioxx Objection Handling Module” with talking points to deflect doctors’ questions. From 2002 to 2005, Merck also sponsored a marketing compilation entitled Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine, published by Elsevier, a respected academic publishing house. A professor of marketing who testified for the plaintiff said in a written statement that Merck distributed the pro-Vioxx publication to doctors as if it were as an independent medical journal. Merck said the articles and abstracts had been reprinted from peer-reviewed medical journals. After Vioxx was taken off the market, some doctors who had supported the drug said they felt disillusioned. The plaintiff’s evidence includes an e-mail message dated Oct. 2, 2004, that Dr. James V. Bertouch, an Australian physician who had been a member of Merck’s arthritis advisory board, sent to fellow board members saying he felt “like the proverbial mushroom” and asked colleagues how they felt being kept in the dark about Vioxx. Mr. Kuhlik of Merck said that the Australian news media had covered only the plaintiffs’ side of the case and that the totality of the evidence would support Merck’s conduct. “It is not uncommon that in high-visibility litigation, you find publicity based on facts, documents and testimony that is often taken out of context,” Mr. Kuhlik said. He added that “a short-term negative story” would not deter Merck from what the company considers the correct course of action. But plaintiffs’ lawyers elsewhere, awaiting their days in court, said they could not explain why Merck would risk such negative publicity in Melbourne after putting Vioxx to rest in the United States “This fantastic stuff is being revealed to us,” said Michael A. Peerless, a lawyer in Ontario who is representing 1,700 Canadian Vioxx plaintiffs and had just returned from a week observing the proceedings in Melbourne. “Where is it going to get them?” The trial continues.

Pressed by insurance companies, some drug makers are beginning to adjust what they charge for their drugs, based on how well the medicines improve patients' health. In a deal expected to be announced Thursday, Merck has agreed to peg what the insurer Cigna pays for the diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet to how well Type 2 diabetes patients are able to control their blood sugar. And last week, the two companies that jointly sell the osteoporosis drug Actonel agreed to reimburse the insurer Health Alliance for the costs of treating fractures suffered by patients taking that medicine. ''We're standing behind our product,'' said Dan Hecht, general manager of the North American pharmaceutical business of Procter &amp; Gamble, which sells Actonel with Sanofi-Aventis. ''We're willing to put our money where our mouth is.'' Some experts hail such arrangements as a welcome step toward health care that rewards good outcomes for patients. ''We're going to see a growth in outcomes guarantees for pharmaceuticals, and it's very healthy,'' said Robert Seidman, a consultant who was formerly the chief pharmacy officer for WellPoint, an insurance company. Traditionally, discounts and rebates that drug companies offer insurers have been based on how much drug is used, not how well patients do. But the emerging, outcomes-based contracts would -- in theory -- better align the incentives of insurers, drug companies and the employers that provide health coverage toward improving people's health. Such pay-for-performance contracts started to take hold a few years ago in countries with national health systems, in which the government could effectively block a drug from being used if it was too costly. Johnson &amp; Johnson set what is considered the prototype deal in 2007 with Britain's national health system, which had tentatively decided not to pay for the cancer drug Velcade. To avert that decision, the company offered essentially a money-back guarantee. If Velcade did not shrink a patient's tumors after a trial treatment, the company would reimburse the health system for the cost of that patient's drug. In the United States, where insurance companies do not have national monopolies -- and where Medicare, by law, is precluded from negotiating drug prices -- insurers have less leverage with drug makers. Even so, they can give favorable treatment to certain drugs, by reducing the required co-payments, for example. Under the Actonel deal, if a patient insured by Health Alliance suffers a nonspinal fracture despite faithfully taking Actonel, the drug makers will help pay for the medical care -- spending $30,000 for a hip fracture, for instance, and $6,000 for a wrist fracture. This clearly lowers the cost of the drug to Health Alliance, a small insurer in Illinois and Iowa. But Procter &amp; Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis might benefit as well. The deal could reduce the pressure on the insurance company to move patients off Actonel, which costs about $100 a month, to less-expensive generic versions of Fosamax. And the insurer has kept Actonel in a tier of its drug list that requires a smaller co-payment than for a competing brand-name drug, Boniva. The deal between Cigna and Merck is more complex. Rather than getting paid more for good results, Merck will actually give Cigna bigger discounts on Januvia and Janumet. Some discounts will be granted if more people diligently take the drugs as prescribed. This helps both Cigna, because people who take their pills are likely to have fewer complications from the disease, and Merck, because it sells more pills. The assumption is that Cigna will push for patient-compliance programs that urge people to take their medicine at the right times and in the proper doses. Moreover, in an unusual move, Merck will offer even greater discounts to Cigna on Januvia and Janumet if patients' blood sugar is better controlled -- regardless of whether the improvement comes through Merck's drugs or other medications. In effect, though, Merck is betting not only that its drugs prove superior but that Cigna's incentives to reap the benefits of the deeper Januvia and Janumet discounts will prompt the insurer to try to keep patients on those drugs. As part of the agreement, too, Merck will get better placement for Januvia and Janumet on Cigna's formulary, meaning a lower co-payment for patients than for some other branded drugs. The deal was made with the pharmacy benefit management division of Cigna, which manages prescriptions for 7.1 million people. Merck declined a request for an interview. In a statement the company said it was ''committed to finding new approaches to demonstrate the value of our products to patients, physicians and payers.'' Januvia, approved in 2006, costs about $150 a month. Janumet, approved a year later, is a combination of Januvia and metformin, a widely used generic drug. Eric Elliott, the president of Cigna Pharmacy Management, said his company was negotiating similar contracts with other drug makers. ''We wanted a contract that drives performance,'' he said. ''Getting this one out will provide more momentum.'' PHOTO: Januvia, by Merck, is part of a cost-control deal with Cigna.(PHOTOGRAPH BY MERCK, VIA BLOOMBERG NEWS)(pg. B6)</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times Merck wants to keep Scherings right to sell Remicade. Multimedia Graphic Drug Industry Consolidation Related Roche Agrees to Buy Genentech for $46.8 Billion (March 13, 2009) Merck to Buy Schering-Plough for $41.1 Billion (March 10, 2009) Times Topics: Johnson &amp; Johnson | Merck &amp; Company Inc. | Remicade (Drug) Add to Portfolio Schering Plough Corp Go to your Portfolio » That’s the question drug analysts and executives are asking in the wake of the deal announced Monday in which Merck would acquire Schering-Plough for $41.1 billion. That agreement involves a complicated structure, called a reverse merger, in which Merck would technically become a subsidiary of Schering  which would in turn rename itself Merck. The contortions are meant to let the new company avoid losing the rights to Remicade, a lucrative rheumatoid arthritis drug that Schering markets internationally under a joint agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Last year, Schering had $2.1 billion in Remicade sales outside the United States, while Johnson &amp; Johnson sold $2.8 billion worth in this country. A change in Schering’s ownership could set off a termination clause in that marketing pact and enable Johnson &amp; Johnson to gain full rights to Remicade, as well as another drug, golimumab, which is pending approval in Europe. During a conference call with analysts on Monday, Fred Hassan, the chief executive of Schering, said he had a cordial conversation that morning with William C. Weldon, the chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Mr. Hassan did not disclose the content of their discussion. And so far, Johnson &amp; Johnson is not commenting  leaving analysts to speculate whether the company will take the Remicade case to arbitration, or maybe even try to pre-empt the Merck-Schering deal with a higher takeover bid. The most complicated hypothesis involves a Solomonic solution in which Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck split Schering. Schering is an attractive takeover candidate for Merck for a number of reasons. Schering’s pipeline of heart, asthma and arthritis drugs would diversify Merck’s drug portfolio. The two companies already collaborate on cholesterol drugs, a franchise that could benefit from consolidation. And expiring patents will expose 35 percent of Merck’s revenue to generic competition by 2012, according to Jason Napodano, an analyst at Zack’s Investment Research. By comparison, Schering will have only 6 percent of its sales exposed by patent loss in 2012, Mr. Napodano wrote. Still, some analysts said Schering could be an equally good fit for Johnson &amp; Johnson. If such a merger occurred, Johnson &amp; Johnson would gain control not only of the Remicade business but also of Schering’s promising drug pipeline, major consumer brands like Coppertone and its profitable animal health business  all of which analysts say would shore up some weak spots in Johnson &amp; Johnson’s portfolio. And the combined entity, they say, would eventually be able to save $3.5 billion annually through consolidation, the same amount projected in the Merck deal. Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in her note to investors on Tuesday that there is a 20 to 25 percent chance that Johnson &amp; Johnson will make a higher offer for Schering. A counterbid from Johnson &amp; Johnson at a premium of 10 percent would amount to $45.2 billion, or a value of $25.98 a share, she wrote, compared to the $23.61-a-share value of Merck’s agreement with Schering. In an interview, she said that Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biggest deal to date is its $16.6 billion purchase in 2006 of Pfizer’s consumer brands including Listerine. “You don’t expect Johnson &amp; Johnson to do a big deal and they haven’t done a big deal, but there are reasons to consider it,” Ms. Arnold said. “Schering-Plough is the best house in the neighborhood. Why wouldn’t you want to buy the most attractive house in the neighborhood?” But Schering would pay a penalty if it accepted a higher offer from a company other than Merck: a breakup fee of $1.25 billion, according to the merger agreement filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A less drastic maneuver for Johnson &amp; Johnson would be to challenge Schering over the international rights to Remicade and golimumab. Under provisions of the companies’ joint marketing agreement, the Remicade arrangement would be terminated under any one of several conditions: if Schering became the subsidiary of another company or if the incumbent board of directors no longer constituted a majority. Merck and Schering say that their reverse merger structure allows the new entity to avoid setting off any of the provisions. But some analysts said the structure leaves room for dispute. “It would seem logical that Johnson &amp; Johnson would challenge that stance,” said Roopesh Patel, an analyst with UBS. But even if Schering were to lose its co-marketing rights to Remicade and golimumab, a merger would still be profitable for Merck, Mr. Patel said. In a note to investors, he estimated that if the merged company retained co-marketing rights, earnings would be $4.32 a share for 2013. Without the two drugs, he wrote, earnings would be an estimated $4.12 a share in 2013  still higher than the $3.08 he projected for Merck for 2013 if there were no merger. A final hypothesis involves Johnson &amp; Johnson buying Schering outright and then selling Merck the cholesterol franchise, which Ms. Arnold valued at $12 billion. But even if all three parties could agree in principle on such a transaction, the net cost to Johnson &amp; Johnson could give it pause. “If it’s over $30 billion, it’s over $30 billion,” Ms. Arnold said. “That’s a lot of money.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 13, 2009, on page B6 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3D7103FF933A25750C0A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=merckandcompany">Merck Refills Pipeline<date>Published: March 10, 2009</date><text>A drug deal that is mainly about the drugs. That was many analysts' assessment Monday of Merck's agreement to pay $41.1 billion in cash and stock for Schering-Plough. The merger would join pharmaceutical companies that had combined sales of $46.9 billion last year. Mega-mergers of this sort have been widely expected ever since Pfizer began the consolidation race in January by agreeing to pay $68 billion for Wyeth. And others are likely to follow, as many of the same factors -- like expiring patents and soaring development costs -- propel drug makers into one another's arms. But if Pfizer-Wyeth was driven in part by desperation, analysts said, for Merck the Schering deal may actually be a good opportunity to restock its medicine chest. Merck's former blockbuster bone drug Fosamax has gone generic, and in a few years the same thing will happen to its best-selling allergy and asthma drug Singulair. The merger gives it access to successful brand-name Schering products with much longer patents, like the prescription allergy spray Nasonex. And Merck could capitalize on Schering's investments in promising biotechnology drugs. ''It's better than the other deal,'' Robert Hazlett, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said of the Merck-Schering merger. ''I'm not enamored of Pfizer-Wyeth.'' Among other measures, he said that Pfizer had said it would slash its second-quarter dividend in half -- to 16 cents -- when it agreed to buy Wyeth, while on Monday Merck told shareholders it would not change its 38-cent quarterly dividend. Still, like any marriage of convenience, this one has potential dissenters who are unlikely to forever hold their peace. One likely controversy involves the cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, which the companies already jointly market and which last year had combined sales of $4.6 billion. But sales have been plummeting in the wake of studies that raised questions about Vytorin's effectiveness and safety. On Monday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, criticized the companies over Vytorin and raised concerns about their planned merger. ''The last time these two companies teamed up, it was to aggressively market a brand-name drug that may not have provided any additional benefits over existing generics,'' he said in an e-mail statement. ''That incident left a sour taste in the mouths of a lot of people, and may have cost the government a lot of money.'' The House Committee on Energy and Commerce has also been investigating the safety and efficacy of Vytorin. Merck executives said Monday they were confident that a broader, longer-term Vytorin study, set to conclude in 2012, would prove the drug to be safe and effective for lowering bad cholesterol. Schering would also provide Merck with popular consumer brands like Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, as well as a strong international presence -- 70 percent of Schering revenue comes from outside the United States -- that would extend Merck's global reach. And much more than Merck, Schering has been investing in developing biologics -- biotechnology drugs derived from living cells, which are much harder for potential generic makers to copy than the small-molecule chemical compounds on which the big pharmaceutical companies have traditionally based their businesses. In 2007, Schering paid $14.4 billion for Organon, a biotechnology company that has several novel drugs, including a fertility treatment, under late development. Fred Hassan, the chief executive of Schering-Plough, described the new company as a juggernaut of drug innovation and development that would have 18 drugs in phase 3 clinical trials -- the late-stage human studies that are required before new drugs can gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration. ''Eighteen phase 3 projects will make this the most effective and strongest R.&amp; D. machine in the industry,'' Mr. Hassan said. By 2011, the merger should generate $3.5 billion in annual cost savings by consolidating research, manufacturing, administration and marketing, Merck's chief executive, Richard T. Clark, said in a conference call with analysts. The new company could reduce the current work force of more than 100,000 by up to 15 percent with the cuts coming mainly from staffing outside of the United States, Mr. Clark said. Further details of the merger are to be made public later in the week, he said. There is at least one big question that hangs over the proposed merger: What happens with Remicade, a rheumatoid arthritis drug that represented $2.1 billion in sales for Schering last year.</text></article>

And for a failing public biotechnology company, it can represent one last roll of the dice. Skip to next paragraph Related Drug Investors Lose Patience (March 10, 2009) Add to Portfolio Schering Plough Corp NitroMed, Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » The gamble is to merge with a privately held company with better prospects. The private company takes over the public stock listing and management of the business. The money that the public company had left is then plowed into developing the formerly private company’s products. If those products succeed, the shareholders in the old public company can eventually benefit. Reverse mergers can be used in other ways, as well. The deal that Merck and Schering-Plough announced Monday, is being done that way to let Schering sidestep a change-of-control clause in a separate drug partnership it has with Johnson &amp; Johnson. The reverse mergers in biotechnology are meant to help private companies go public at a time when market conditions have made it virtually impossible for them to pursue conventional initial public offerings. But some of the shareholders in the public companies say their company’s cash is being given away too cheaply. Last March, an investor revolt stopped VaxGen, an unsuccessful vaccine developer, from merging with privately held Raven Biotechnologies. “We were essentially selling our company for 50 cents on the dollar,” said Kurt von Emster, who was then manager of the MPM BioEquities Fund, a VaxGen shareholder. VaxGen is now considering other options. In January, Deerfield Management, which owns 11 percent of NitroMed, agreed to buy the rest of the company for around 80 cents a share, or about $36 million, to stop it from merging with privately held Archemix. NitroMed’s lone product, a hypertension drug specifically for black patients, has poor sales. Deerfield complained that NitroMed shareholders would own only 30 percent of the merged company. In a letter to NitroMed it also said there were conflicts of interest, an apparent reference to the fact that two venture capital firms with representatives on NitroMed’s board were also investors in Archemix. Another controversial reverse merger, of publicly traded Novacea and privately held Transcept Pharmaceuticals, was approved in January by Novacea shareholders. Novacea’s cash, more than $80 million, will now go toward developing Transcept’s sleeping pill. Novacea’s shares fell 24 percent the day the proposed deal was announced, a sign that some investors did not like it. Had the company been dissolved in the middle of last year, after its prostate cancer drug had failed in a late-stage clinical trial, investors would have received about $15 a share in cash, adjusted for splits. The stock of the company, renamed Transcept, is now trading at about $2.96. But John P. Walker, who was the chief executive of Novacea until the merger, said most of the company’s shareholders preferred to gamble on an eventual big return if Transcept succeeded, rather than accept the liquidation value of Novacea. “They were all very supportive of finding an opportunity of putting the capital to work,” he said.

Drug industry analysts have fantasy mergers. In the pharmaceutical version of the game, analysts use balance sheets to project how big-league drug companies could acquire more nimble rivals. The goal is to enhance product rosters, while reducing costs by shedding redundant staff and operations. Dreaming up dream teams has become a popular sport since Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, said it would buy Wyeth last month in a deal valued at $68 billion. Meanwhile, the big Swiss drug maker Roche is engaged in a hostile tender offer for the 44 percent of the American biotechnology company Genentech that it does not already own. ''Cash is up but valuations are down,'' said David S. Moskowitz, director of research at Caris &amp; Company, an investment bank. ''We see this as a major year of consolidation.'' In interviews, a half-dozen analysts suggested that three other giants -- Merck, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- could be in the takeover hunt. The most talked-about targets are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough. ''When you are trying to prognosticate, look for companies that are already collaborating, that already have a relationship with late-stage drugs or drugs that are already on the market,'' said Jason Napodano, an analyst with Zacks Investment Research. ''Then you buy 100 percent rights to the drug by buying the whole company.'' Merck is among the big pharmaceutical companies that are facing patent expirations on top-selling drugs with few promising prospects to replace them. The company, with a market value of about $60 billion, tops many analysts' lists as a potential acquirer. It has $6.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, according to the latest publicly available data. Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, which makes the bone drug Fosamax and the Gardasil vaccine for the virus that can cause cervical cancer, did not dispute the prospects for a merger when asked about the company's plans during a recent conference call with analysts. ''There are opportunities across the whole spectrum that we look at,'' Mr. Clark said. In response to a reporter's query, a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail message that Mr. Clark was traveling and not available to elaborate. Analysts said it was simply a question of whether Merck would pursue a more traditional drug maker, like Schering-Plough, with which it already collaborates on cholesterol treatments and which has a market capitalization of about $29 billion. Or Merck might expand into another realm with a biotechnology company like Gilead Sciences, a $46 billion company that specializes in H.I.V. drugs. Among other big pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis have enough cash to be in the market for the kind of purchase that would help them restock product lines while reducing expenses through consolidation. But executives at those companies have all said they are not interested in megamergers. ''These big massive deals, I've been through two of them, and you're out of the picture for three or four years trying to get those bedded down,'' Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi's chief executive since December, said in a recent telephone interview. He was referring to his 20 years at GlaxoSmithKline during which he saw the company, originally SmithKline, merge with Beecham in 1989 and Glaxo Wellcome in 2000. ''Making companies so big is one of the reasons our research and development innovation went off,'' Mr. Viehbacher said. His plan, he said, is to increase Sanofi's research partnerships with outside companies and expand into generics, vaccines and over-the-counter drugs. As for medium-size companies, analysts said that Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca could be either buyers or sellers. But Lilly, with a market cap of about $37 billion, is still digesting its $6.5 billion purchase of ImClone five months ago, which may make it unlikely to buy anything else soon. David Brennan, chief executive of the $51 billion AstraZeneca, recently told reporters his hands were full cutting the work force while looking for small acquisitions. Mr. Moskowitz of Caris, among other analysts, said that likely takeover candidates included Schering-Plough and Bristol-Myers, because they have fewer drugs whose patents are lapsing and have a number of drugs in the mid or late stages of development.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Schering Plough Corp Go to your Portfolio » The two New Jersey-based companies, which announced significant job cuts last fall, have been striving to become more efficient amid setbacks to their cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia, whose combined quarterly sales slumped 26 percent. The reports close out a mixed reporting season for large drug makers, many of which also relied on cost cuts to offset tepid sales. European rivals Roche Holding and GlaxoSmithKline report later this week. “Schering-Plough and Merck are both holding up pretty well when you consider what’s happening in the economy,” an analyst at Edward Jones, Linda Bannister, said. Merck shares were up 4.7 percent in late morning trading, while Schering shares were up 3.8 percent. Investor enthusiasm for the results was tempered by disappointing sales for significant products. Merck reported a 16 percent decline in sales of its Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine, and cut its expectation for the product’s sales this year, while sales of Schering-Plough’s Remicade arthritis drug missed analyst forecasts. Some analysts say they believe Schering could be the next large pharmaceutical takeover target on the heels of Pfizer’s $68 billion deal to acquire Wyeth because of its relatively digestible size and because none of its big products face generic competition any time soon. “Given the attractiveness that Pfizer thinks they can get out of the synergies with Wyeth, it would seem that pharma-on-pharma-type acquisitions still make sense from a cost standpoint,” said Chris Armbruster, research analyst at Al Frank Asset Management. For the fourth quarter, Merck had net income of $1.64 billion, or 78 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $1.63 billion, or 75 cents a share, in the period a year ago, when Merck took a $4.85 billion charge related to a legal settlement for its withdrawn Vioxx arthritis drug. Excluding special items, earnings were 87 cents a share, 13 cents ahead of analysts’ average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. On top of cost controls, Merck’s tax rate was about 10 percentage points lower than some analysts expected, bolstering results. Merck’s sales fell 3 percent, to $6.03 billion, but were slightly ahead of the $5.98 billion expected by analysts. Combined sales of its new diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet, soared 80 percent to $533 million. The drug maker cut its forecast for 2009 Gardasil sales by about $300 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Gardasil, which is facing competition from Cervarix from Glaxo, was recently denied approval by American regulators for use by women aged 27 to 45. For the quarter, Schering-Plough earned $442 million, or 27 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $3.4 billion, or $2.08 a share, a year earlier, when it took charges for its purchase of Organon BioSciences. Excluding items, Schering earned 39 cents a share, 9 cents ahead of analysts’ targets. Sales, including new products from the Organon deal, rose 17 percent, to $4.35 billion, a bit shy of analysts’ projection of $4.51 billion. Sales growth was crimped 6 percentage points by the strengthening dollar, which lowers the value of overseas sales when converted back into United States currency.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/business/10merck.html?ref=merckandcompany">Merck Restructuring Puts a Focus on Generic Drugs<date>Published: December 9, 2008</date><text>WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. (AP)  The drug maker Merck &amp; Company said Tuesday that it was taking steps to become a leader in generic biotechnology drugs and sales in emerging markets, diversifying its research through partnerships and new technologies and working to maximize long-term sales of crucial products. During its annual business briefing, Merck tried to reassure investors that it has the right strategy to resume growing  after recently announcing another major restructuring and forecasting lower profits and flat revenue in 2009 because of generic competition, the recession and other problems. “Merck has been through tough times before and has rebounded in ways that few other companies have,” the chief executive, Richard T. Clark, told analysts, probably referring to the debacle over the withdrawn painkiller, Vioxx. He vowed to ensure the company rebounds after a year of transition in 2009, predicting Merck “will be one of the winners in the pharmaceutical industry of the future.” The company makes the respiratory drug Singulair and the cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia. It has been dogged by plans to seek approval for three new drugs next year, has seven more in late-stage testing and will start late-stage tests on six others in 2009. Merck is starting a new division called Merck BioVentures to make both new and follow-on, or generic, biotech drugs, management told analysts gathered at its headquarters. Such generic biologic drugs, while starting to arrive in Europe, are not yet allowed in the United States  but that will probably be a hot issue in Washington next year. The unit will use new science to speed up drug development, including glycoengineering, a technology Merck got with a 2006 acquisition that uses yeast to rapidly make antibodies and other proteins for drugs. Peter Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the unit would invest $1.5 billion in research by 2015 and build a commercial factory by 2012, and aimed to start six or more generic biotech products from 2012 through 2017.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/business/05merck.html?ref=merckandcompany">Merck Offers a Cautious Forecast for 2009<date>Published: December 4, 2008</date><text>Merck &amp; Company forecast 2009 earnings and revenue below Wall Street expectations on Thursday, citing a harsh impact from the stronger dollar and continuing sluggish sales of several big medicines. The drug maker, whose shares fell 4 percent in morning trading, projected flat or little 2009 growth for sales of three major products: the asthma medicine Singulair, the blood-pressure drug Cozaar and the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil. “It is possible that, as in the past, this is intentionally conservative initial guidance that will be revised upwards through the year but we cannot be certain,” a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Tim Anderson, said in a research note. Between foreign exchange rates and several struggling franchises,” he said, “the company does face significant headwinds in ’09 and possibly beyond.” Merck’s chief financial officer, Peter Kellogg, also told analysts in a conference call that he expected combined global sales of its Vytorin and Zetia cholesterol fighters, which Merck sells in partnership with Schering-Plough, to fall next year because of flagging United States demand. On the positive side, Merck projected strong growth for its relatively new Januvia diabetes franchise, as well as for its HIV drug Isentress and shingles vaccine Zostavax. The company also expects to seek approval next year for two new medicines for migraines and acute heart failure. The New Jersey-based drug maker has experienced sluggish demand for Singulair and its cholesterol drugs because of safety or effectiveness worries, while its osteoporosis drug Fosamax faces generic competition. Merck said in October it was cutting 7,200 positions, adding to cuts from an earlier restructuring. Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, said on Thursday that it expected 2009 earnings, excluding special items, of $3.15 to $3.30 a share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates were expecting $3.52, on average. The 2009 forecast excludes restructuring charges of $400 million to $600 million. Merck said it expects global sales next year of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion, little changed from expected 2008 revenue and shy of the $24.7 billion expected by analysts. “We anticipate that top-line growth will be offset by the effects of a volatile global economy, fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets, as well as continued challenges for certain key products,” Merck’s chief executive, Richard Clark, said in a statement. Merck said the strengthening dollar would crimp 2009 revenue by 3 percentage points, while having a negative 6 percent impact on earnings per share. Some analysts had predicted Merck would issue a conservative 2009 forecast, given the unfavorable foreign currency swing. Revenue of United States drug makers in recent years has been greatly bolstered by a weak dollar, which increases the value of overseas sales when converted back into American currency. But the stronger dollar may now turn currency trends against the companies. Even so, Merck stuck to its earlier long-range forecast of compound earnings per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digit range from 2005 to 2010, excluding special items. It also backed its 2008 forecast of $3.28 to $3.32 a share, excluding items. Mr. Clark told the Reuters Health Summit last month that he expected profit growth for the company from 2010 to 2013 despite looming generic competition for Cozaar and Singulair. He also said Merck had the appetite to buy a big biotechnology company if the right deal came along. Through Wednesday, Merck shares had fallen some 54 percent this year.

Skip to next paragraph Adam Berry/Bloomberg News Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, said on Wednesday that the company wanted to expand its biotechnology work. While Merck’s move is not directly related to the overall financial crisis, the layoffs can only help contribute to what is seen as a coming recession. Besetting Merck is the same issue that has shaken other big drug companies  the inability to develop new drugs fast enough to maintain rapid growth and to offset the expiring patents that expose big-selling products to an onslaught of generic competition. Merck said on Wednesday that it expected sales to grow only 2 percent to 4 percent a year in the five-year period that ends in 2010, and for earnings to grow by no more than the high single digits. That is lower than previous forecasts and a far cry from the double-digit growth that drug companies once took for granted. Similar troubles have brought cuts at most big pharmaceutical companies. The industry has shed about 100,000 jobs in the last five years, according to Viren Mehta, founder of Mehta Partners, a strategic and investment advisory firm that focuses on the pharmaceutical industry. Merck, which now has 56,700 employees, eliminated 10,400 jobs as part of a reorganization announced in 2005, a year after its Vioxx pain reliever was removed from the market because of safety concerns. Merck shares were down 6.5 percent, to $28.02, on Wednesday. The new cuts will take place by the end of 2011 and will involve all areas of the company. About 40 percent of the cuts will come in the United States. The ranks of senior and midlevel executives will be sliced by 25 percent. And three research sites, in Seattle, Japan and Italy, will be closed by the end of 2009. The moves are meant to save the company $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion in operating costs through 2013. But they will also cost the company $1.6 billion to $2 billion in severance pay and other reorganization charges. Merck’s chief executive, Richard T. Clark, said on Wednesday that the overhaul was part of an effort to position Merck for the future  not a response to particular problems in 2008. Merck is trying to reduce its reliance on huge sales forces that bombard doctors. It wants to speed innovation by consolidating research on particular diseases in single locations. And it plans to outsource more manufacturing. “If you don’t change these business models, we’re not going to survive as an industry, let alone a company,” Mr. Clark told analysts on a conference call. But Merck has plenty of specific problems that hurt its third-quarter financial results, also announced on Wednesday. Sales of Fosamax, its osteoporosis drug, plunged 51 percent in the quarter because it lost patent protection. Sales of the cholesterol-lowering drugs Vytorin and Zetia, which are marketed by a joint venture with Schering-Plough, dropped 15 percent worldwide in the quarter, to $1.1 billion, compared with the same period a year ago. The decline came after studies showed that Vytorin was no more effective than a generic statin in stopping the buildup of fatty plaques in arteries and might pose a cancer risk. Sales of the asthma and allergy drug Singulair, the biggest drug Merck sells by itself, increased only 1 percent, to $1 billion, after the Food and Drug Administration said in March that it was looking into whether the drug might increase the risk of suicides. Merck also had setbacks in its vaccine division, which had been a bright spot for the company. Sales of Gardasil, the cervical cancer vaccine, were $401 million for the quarter, a decrease of 4 percent, as questions arose over the vaccine’s necessity, cost and safety, and Merck’s marketing tactics. On the positive side, sales of Januvia, a diabetes drug, and Isentress, a new AIDS drug, did well. Over all, Merck’s earnings fell to 51 cents a share, from 70 cents a year ago, largely because of reorganization charges. Excluding those and other items, the earnings were 80 cents a share, compared with 75 cents a year ago. Merck said its earning for the year would be at the low end of previous guidance. Merck is also planning to move more aggressively into biotechnology drugs, which are made in living cells. These represent some of the industry’s biggest sellers and, for regulatory and scientific reasons, are not subject to the same rapid onslaught of generic competition as pills made from chemicals. Merck has been slower than some of its competitors in moving into biotechnology. But Mr. Clark said Merck aimed to be a leader in that field, suggesting that it planned to make drugs similar to big sellers like Epogen and Neupogen, both from Amgen, which bolster blood cells.

But the two companies fell short of complete disclosure, and the industry as a whole lags far behind. Legislation to establish a wide-ranging nationwide reporting system is still needed. Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » Patients need to know that doctors are prescribing particular drugs for sound medical reasons  not because drug companies have bought their doctors’ loyalty. The companies certainly spend large amounts of money plying doctors with gifts, hosting them at plush resorts where drug products are promoted, and paying them to deliver or attend lectures or for consulting or research. Some of the payments are for legitimate services, others look like improper inducements, and all have a potential to influence a doctor’s prescribing habits. Eli Lilly announced that, starting next year, it would post in an online database all of its payments to doctors for speaking and consulting services, two of the most easily abused categories of payments. Merck said it would disclose payments made to physicians “who speak on behalf of our company or our products.” These pledges are a step in the right direction and ought to be emulated by all other pharmaceutical companies. But voluntary piecemeal disclosures are not enough. A sound Senate bill, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, would establish a mandatory national registry of payments to physicians. The bipartisan legislation, sponsored by Senators Charles Grassley and Herb Kohl, would require reporting by drug companies and the manufacturers of medical devices, medical supplies and biological medicines. Companies would have to disclose not only speaking and consulting fees but a wide range of other payments to physicians, like stock options, profit distributions, ownership or investment interests, gifts, travel and entertainment, and payment for clinical investigations. The bill is endorsed by Lilly, Merck and the chief pharmaceutical trade association, and has the support of many medical authorities. The next Congress should move quickly to pass the legislation. Patients have a right to know who else is paying their doctors and why.

Skip to next paragraph RSS Feed Get Health News From The New York Times » John C. Lechleiter, chief executive of Eli Lilly &amp; Company, announced on Wednesday that starting next year it intended to post in an online database all its payments to doctors for speaking and consulting services. The postings will “likely include” the names of the doctors, or will provide some other identifying information about them, along with the reason for the payments, the company said. In the wake of Lilly’s announcement, Merck &amp; Company said later Wednesday that it would disclose speaking fees it pays to doctors, also beginning in 2009. Members of Congress have been pushing for a national registry of such payments. In the last year and a half, Senate investigations have found that prominent researchers at several institutions, including Harvard and the University of Cincinnati, failed to report millions of dollars in outside income from drug makers, contrary to the institutions’ reporting requirements. University administrators and journal editors say they have no reliable way to verify doctors’ private income from industry. Research has found that industry money can bias doctors’ interpretation of study findings and may alter their prescribing habits. A bipartisan bill called the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, expected to be taken up by Congress next year, would require such a registry. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry’s principal trade group, supports the legislation, as do the American Medical Association and a number of major drug makers. “Though we remain hopeful that the Sunshine Act will be passed by Congress at some point, Lilly is taking action independently,” Dr. Lechleiter said Wednesday in a speech to the Economic Club of Indiana. “Being more transparent by opening up our business to the public is an important step to building trust and confidence.” A Lilly spokesman said the company hoped others would follow its lead, a wish voiced by some independent experts. “This is a good step, and one that should be emulated by other companies, even in the absence of legislation requiring it,” Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, medicine and law at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, said in an e-mail message. Dr. Appelbaum said the simplest way to achieve comprehensive disclosure was for the industry itself to maintain public records. “Any physician who believes that disclosure is likely to be embarrassing,” he said, “should not be accepting the money in the first place.” As of late Wednesday, Merck was the only other drug company to have joined Lilly in announcing plans for disclosure of such payments. A spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Tuesday that the company supported a revised version of the Sunshine Act and had committed to disclosing payments for educational grants and to patient-advocacy organizations by early 2009. A spokesman for AstraZeneca said that it already posted educational grants and contributions to nonprofits but that it had not made a decision “on other areas just yet.” A spokesman for Pfizer said it supported the Sunshine Act. Lilly was the first drug maker to publish extensive clinical trial data online, beginning in 2004, and last year it began posting its educational grants and charitable contributions online. Its new database will record all payments it makes to doctors on or after next Jan. 1, and will be accessible online in June or July. If Congress passes a law requiring such reporting, the information will be brought into line with federal guidelines, the company said. Through a spokeswoman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who has been leading the investigations into drug companies’ payment practices, said: “Disclosing information about financial relationships between industry and doctors is a good thing, and this announcement contributes to transparency. My effort for broad-based transparency and accountability will continue because a uniform reporting requirement is needed to get the full picture.” Drug companies’ payments to doctors generally fall into one of two broad categories: speaking fees, to doctors who give presentations about products to other doctors, very often while the group dines at the company’s expense; and consulting fees, to experts who advise the company on new product development or help design clinical trials. Commercial arrangements are common throughout medicine. In the last two decades, drug and device makers have made payments to tens of thousands of doctors and researchers in all specialties. Worried that this money could taint doctors’ research plans or clinical judgment, government agencies, medical journals and universities have been looking more closely at the deals. Minnesota and Vermont are among the few states that have been keeping a record of those payments. From 1997, when Minnesota began its database, to 2005, drug makers made payments to more than 5,500 doctors, nurses and other health care providers in the state, totaling at least $57 million, the state found. An additional $40 million went to clinics, research centers and other organizations. More than 20 percent of the state’s licensed physicians received money. Vermont reported last year that from July 2005 to June 2006, 81 drug manufacturers spent a total of $2.25 million on “fees, travel expenses and other direct payments to Vermont physicians, hospitals, universities and others for the purpose of marketing their products.” More Articles in Health » A version of this article appeared in print on September 25, 2008, on page A18 of the New York edition.</text></article>

The new labeling indicates the vaccine also protects against cancers of the vagina and the vulva, which affect more than 5,000 women in the United States each year, according to Merck. The vaccine works by defending against four strains of the human papillomavirus, which cause the majority of cervical cancers. A Merck scientist said the virus accounted for a smaller portion of cancers of the vagina and the vulva, though he added that it played a role in more than half of them. ''Any time we have evidence of additional cancer protection, that's a really important piece of information,'' said the scientist, Rick Haupt, executive director for H.P.V. vaccines.</text></article>

None of the patients took the medicine for more than 12 weeks, and the trials offered no evidence that it had reduced heart attacks or cardiovascular disease, the goal of any cholesterol drug. The lack of evidence has not stopped doctors from heavily prescribing that drug, whether in a stand-alone form sold as Zetia or as a combination medicine called Vytorin. Aided by extensive consumer advertising, sales of the medicines reached $5.2 billion last year, making them among the best-selling drugs in the world. More than three million people worldwide take either drug every day. But there is still no proof that the drugs help patients live longer or avoid heart attacks. This year Vytorin has failed two clinical trials meant to show its benefits. Worse, scientists are debating whether there is a link between the drugs and cancer. Researchers reported last month that patients in three clinical trials had a 40 percent higher chance of dying from cancer if they took Vytorin instead of a sugar pill or another medicine, although the leader of that study says the finding might be due to chance. Now some prominent cardiologists say that the evidence has swung so decisively against the drugs that they should not be sold. ''The only place people should be taking it is in a clinical trial,'' Dr. Allen J. Taylor of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center said of Zetia. (Vytorin is a single pill that combines Zetia with a statin, an older form of cholesterol-lowering medicine whose effectiveness and safety are not in question.) On Tuesday, in a sign of the high level of interest among doctors that Vytorin and Zetia have generated, the New England Journal of Medicine will publish online two articles and an editorial about the trials that raised the potential cancer concerns. Merck and Schering-Plough, which jointly make Vytorin and Zetia, strongly defend their medicines. The companies say that ezetimibe, the generic name for Zetia, showed no cancer risk in animal trials and argue that the cancer finding is probably a result of chance. Some independent scientists agree with the companies, saying that they are dubious of a link to cancer and that ezetimibe is a valuable treatment no matter which brand it is sold under. About the only point on which both sides agree is that no one can judge ezetimibe's safety and benefits for certain without more data, ideally from a clinical trial covering more than 10,000 patients and lasting several years, long enough to show that the drug actually helps patients live longer or avoid heart attacks. But patients and doctors will have to wait years more for those results. Merck and Schering did not begin such a trial until October 2005, three years after ezetimibe was approved. And the completion date for the trial has been repeatedly postponed. Now the companies estimate that it will not be finished until at least 2012. By then tens of millions of people will have taken ezetimibe. ''I don't think the answer on Zetia is in,'' said Dr. Robert J. Temple, director for the office of medical policy at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which is part of the F.D.A. The lack of data about ezetimibe highlights an aspect of the drug approval system that even sophisticated patients may not understand. Many medicines are approved on the basis of what scientists call surrogate endpoints, like proof that they lower cholesterol, rather than because they have been shown to reduce the risk of death or disease. For example, a cancer drug might be approved because it causes tumors to shrink, not because its manufacturer can prove that patients live longer after taking it. Using these measures makes sense in certain circumstances, researchers say. If no treatments exist for a disease, the F.D.A. may approve a drug based on its promise in short-term trials and hope that the medicine succeeds later in larger trials where its potential to reduce death and disease will be examined directly.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Caleb Kenna for The New York Times A Merck advertisement for Gardasil, a cancer vaccine. The Evidence Gap The Protection Market Previous Articles in the Series » Multimedia Graphic An Uneven Killer RSS Feed Get Health News From The New York Times » Enlarge This Image Caleb Kenna for The New York Times Merck lobbied every opinion leader, womens group, medical society, politicians, and went directly to the people  it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now. Dr. Diane Harper, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School Tens of millions of girls and young women have been vaccinated against the disease in the United States and Europe in the two years since two vaccines were given government approval in many countries and, often, recommended for universal use among females ages 11 to 26. One of the vaccines, Gardasil, from Merck, is made available to the poorest girls in the country, up to age 18, at a potential cost to the United States government of more than $1 billion; proposals to mandate the vaccine for girls in middle schools have been offered in 24 states, and one will take effect in Virginia this fall. Even the normally stingy British National Health Service will start giving the other vaccine  Cervarix, from GlaxoSmithKline  to all 12-year-old girls at school this September. The lightning-fast transition from newly minted vaccine to must-have injection in the United States and Europe represents a triumph of what the manufacturers call education and their critics call marketing. The vaccines, which offer some protection against infection from sexually transmitted viruses, are far more expensive than earlier vaccines against other diseases  Gardasil’s list price is $360 for the three-dose series, and the total cost is typically $400 to nearly $1,000 with markup and office visits (and often only partially covered by health insurance). Award-winning advertising has promoted the vaccines. Before the film “Sex and the City,” some moviegoers in the United States saw ads for Gardasil. On YouTube and in advertisements on popular shows like “Law and Order,” a multiethnic cast of young professionals urges girls to become “one less statistic” by getting vaccinated. The vaccine makers have also brought attention to cervical cancer by providing money for activities by patients’ and women’s groups, doctors and medical experts, lobbyists and political organizations interested in the disease, sometimes in ways that skirt disclosure requirements or obscure the companies’ involvement. Even critics of the marketing efforts recognize the benefits of the vaccines. Girls who get the shots are less likely to have Pap tests with worrisome results that would lead to further treatment, saving themselves anxiety and discomfort and, in those cases, saving money. When it occurs, cervical cancer is a dreadful disease; genital warts, partly prevented by the Merck vaccine, can be a painful nuisance. But some experts worry about the consequences of the rapid rollout of the new vaccines without more medical evidence about how best to deploy them. They say that because of the aggressive marketing, even parents of girls who are far from being sexually active may feel pressured into giving them a vaccine that is not yet needed and whose long-term impact is still unclear. Legislative efforts to require girls to have the vaccine only add to the pressure. In the United States, hundreds of doctors have been recruited and trained to give talks about Gardasil  $4,500 for a lecture  and some have made hundreds of thousands of dollars. Politicians have been lobbied and invited to receptions urging them to legislate against a global killer. And former state officials have been recruited to lobby their former colleagues. “There was incredible pressure from industry and politics,” said Dr. Jon Abramson, a professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest University who was chairman of the committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended the vaccine for all girls once they reached 11 or 12. “This big push is making people crazy  thinking they’re bad moms if they don’t get their kids vaccinated,” said Dr. Abby Lippman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal and policy director of the Canadian Women’s Health Network. Canada will spend $300 million on a cervical cancer vaccine program. Merck’s vaccine was studied in clinical trials for five years, and Glaxo’s for nearly six and a half, so it is not clear how long the protection will last. Some data from the clinical trials indicate immune molecules may wane after three to five years. If a 12-year-old is vaccinated, will she still be protected in college, when her risk of infection is higher? Or will a booster vaccine be necessary? Some experts are concerned about possible side effects that become apparent only after a vaccine has been more widely tested over longer periods. And why the sudden alarm in developed countries about cervical cancer, some experts ask. A major killer in the developing world, particularly Africa, where the vaccines are too expensive for use, cervical cancer is classified as very rare in the West because it is almost always preventable through regular Pap smears, which detect precancerous cells early enough for effective treatment. Indeed, because the vaccines prevent only 70 percent of cervical cancers, Pap smear screening must continue anyway. “Merck lobbied every opinion leader, women’s group, medical society, politicians, and went directly to the people  it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now,” said Dr. Diane Harper, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. Dr. Harper was a principal investigator on the clinical trials of both Gardasil and Cervarix, and she spent 2006-7 on sabbatical at the World Health Organization developing plans for cervical cancer vaccine programs around the world. “Because Merck was so aggressive, it went too fast,” Dr. Harper said. “I would have liked to see it go much slower.” In receiving expedited consideration from the Food and Drug Administration, Gardasil took six months from application to approval and was recommended by the C.D.C. weeks later for universal use among girls. Most vaccines take three years to get that sort of endorsement, Dr. Harper said, and then 5 to 10 more for universal acceptance. “In that time, you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it,” Dr. Harper said. “Those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk.” Dr. Richard Haupt, medical director at Merck, said the vaccine had not been rushed into use, saying that five years in clinical trails was normal before applying for licensing. He said Merck educated physicians, politicians and the public about the new vaccine to “accelerate and facilitate access.” Spokesmen for Merck and Glaxo say all indications are that their vaccines are safe and effective, and there is no evidence that a booster shot will be needed. A Glaxo spokeswoman, Sarah Alspach, said its formulation produces a “stronger and longer-lasting immune response” than conventional vaccines. 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page » Andrew Lehren contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Schering Plough Corp Go to your Portfolio » The scientists who reported on the trial, called Seas, cautioned against panicking over the cancer findings, saying that even well-designed clinical trials sometimes produce chance results. A review of two other, much larger trials did not find a similar risk, they said. Vytorin and Zetia, a companion drug, are prescribed each month to almost three million people worldwide and are among the world’s top-selling medicines. But other cardiologists and epidemiologists said that the cancer risk could not be so easily dismissed. The findings of the Seas trial will heighten concerns about Vytorin’s safety and effectiveness, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a former president of the American College of Cardiology and a longtime critic of Vytorin. Six months ago, a fourth clinical trial, called Enhance, also failed to show that Vytorin benefited patients, leading a panel of top cardiologists to recommend using Vytorin and Zetia only as a last resort. Since that recommendation, Vytorin and Zetia prescriptions have plunged, though the drugs remain among the largest sellers for Merck and Schering- Plough, which jointly sell them. The drugs had combined sales of $5 billion last year. Shares of Merck and Schering skidded Monday after the Seas trial results were reported, with Merck shares down 6 percent and Schering down 12 percent. After the close of trading, both companies reported second-quarter earnings that were slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates. Vytorin is a single pill that combines two cholesterol-lowering medicines  Zocor, or simvastatin, and Zetia, or ezetimibe. Both Zocor and Zetia are also available as single pills. Zocor is a statin. Because two decades of research have proven that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks and do not raise the risk of cancer, the new safety concerns center around ezetimibe. In the United States, about two million prescriptions a month are written for ezetimibe, either independently as Zetia or in the Vytorin combination pill. In the Seas trial, which involved nearly 1,900 patients whose heart valves were partially blocked, participants were given either Vytorin or a placebo pill that contained no medicine. Scientists hoped that the trial would show that patients taking Vytorin would have a lower risk of needing valve replacement surgery or having heart failure. But the drug did not show those benefits. “No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups for the combined primary endpoint,” Dr. Terje Pedersen, the principal investigator for the study and a professor medicine at Ulleval University Hospital in Norway, said. The primary endpoint is the result that scientists hope to prove when they conduct a clinical trial. However, patients taking Vytorin in the Seas trial did have a sharply higher risk of developing and dying from cancer. In the trial 102 patients taking Vytorin developed cancer, compared with 67 taking the placebo. Of those, 39 people taking Vytorin died from their cancer, compared with 23 taking placebo. The absolute numbers of cancer cases were relatively small. But they reached statistical significance, meaning the odds were less than 5 percent that they were the result of chance. To evaluate the cancer findings, Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, examined the interim results of two other clinical trials of Vytorin  called Sharp and Improve-It. The University of Oxford is leading the Sharp trial, which is sponsored by Merck and Schering-Plough but run independently by the university’s Clinical Trial Service Unit. The Improve-It trial is being led by investigators by Harvard and Duke University. Both Sharp and Improve-It are comparing Vytorin with simvastatin  Zocor  alone. Neither trial has yet been completed, but the two trials combined have about 20,000 patients, nearly 10 times as many as the Seas trial. So far, about the same number of patients taking Vytorin in Sharp and Improve-It have developed cancer as those taking simvastatin alone, Mr. Peto said in London on Monday. That fact strongly suggests that the finding in Seas is due to chance, Mr. Peto said. “I think we should not be diverted by fears of cancer,” he said. Mr. Peto also noted that the increase in cancers was not clustered around a single type of malignancy, but occurred widely. If ezetimibe did cause cancer, it would be more likely to cause a single type than many types, he said. But other doctors said the data from Improve-It and Sharp were not definitive. The patients in those trials have generally been followed for one to two years, while the Seas trial followed patients for four years. Because cancer generally takes years to develop, it may take some time for Vytorin’s risks  if they are real  to become evident in patients. “I don’t know that you have much information about the cancer risk from the other two trials,” said Dr. Bruce Psaty, professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington. In addition, the other two trials contain a puzzling finding. While the number of cancer cases is similar in those trials among patients taking Vytorin and those who were not, the number of cancer deaths is approximately one-third higher among those taking Vytorin. In all, 136 people taking Vytorin have died of cancer in the three trials, compared with 95 taking other medicines or a sugar placebo pill. Dr. Rob Califf, the director of the Duke Translational Medicine Institute and the co-chairman of Improve-It, the largest of the clinical trials examining Vytorin, said that stopping the trials early would be a mistake, since there was no proof that ezetimibe  either in the form of Vytorin or Zetia  caused cancer. “To accept nonevidence as evidence is a worse mistake than to finish the trial and get the data one way or the other,” Dr. Califf said. However, patients outside the trials, who can choose to take other cholesterol-lowering drugs, should discuss the findings with their doctors, he said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Merck Statement A state appeals court in Texas overturned a $26 million jury verdict against the company in a lawsuit brought by Carol Ernst, whose husband, Robert, died in 2001 after taking Vioxx. In reversing the verdict, the appeals court found that plaintiffs had not proved that Vioxx caused Mr. Ernst’s death. Separately, an appeals court in New Jersey sharply reduced a verdict in another Vioxx case. The court ruled that the jury should not have been allowed to award punitive damages against Merck or to find that Merck had committed consumer fraud. Only compensatory damages of $4.5 million were permitted, the court said. The rulings on Thursday leave lawyers for plaintiffs with just three victories, all with relatively small awards, in the nearly 20 Vioxx cases that have reached juries. Mark Lanier, a plaintiffs’ lawyer who was involved in both cases decided Thursday, criticized the decisions and promised appeals. But plaintiffs face an uphill battle. Bruce Kuhlik, Merck’s general counsel, said the company was pleased with the rulings. “Our faith in the judges and the fairness of the process has been well placed,” he said. Thursday’s ruling may further discourage lawyers from pursuing lawsuits against drug makers. Already, plaintiffs’ lawyers are nervously awaiting a Supreme Court ruling in a case that will be heard this fall and could bar most lawsuits against companies for injuries said to be caused by prescription medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the government’s and drug industry’s argument in the Supreme Court case, the F.D.A., not individual juries, should be responsible for evaluating the risks and benefits of a drug. In the short run, Thursday’s rulings will make little difference either to Merck or plaintiffs’ lawyers, since the two sides have already agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement that will largely end the Vioxx litigation. The settlement covers about 50,000 people who have sued Merck claiming that they or their family members had heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx. Plaintiffs face a June 30 deadline to agree to the settlement, which will result in an average payment of roughly $100,000 a plaintiff before legal fees, or to opt out and continue their lawsuits. Merck can opt out of the settlement if not enough plaintiffs agree to it. But Mr. Kuhlik said on Thursday that about 95 percent of eligible plaintiffs had agreed to the deal and that the company was nearly certain it will go forward. Michael Krensavage, a former health care investment analyst and now the managing partner of Krensavage Partners, a health care fund, said that the rulings released Thursday made him doubt the wisdom of Merck’s decision last November to settle the lawsuits. “Today’s decisions verify Merck’s initial strategy of fighting every case and raises questions about the wisdom of settling,” Mr. Krensavage said. Mr. Kuhlik, Merck’s general counsel, said the company was satisfied that it had made the right decision in settling. And Benjamin Zipursky, a professor at Fordham Law School who has closely followed the Vioxx litigation, said Thursday’s rulings did not change his opinion that Merck had been right to settle the cases. The appeals court rulings are not as positive for Merck as they may first appear, Mr. Zipursky said. The Texas appeals court overturned the verdict on narrow factual grounds, he said, while the New Jersey court did allow for a damages award. “A $4.5 million compensatory damages award for the plaintiff was affirmed,” Mr. Zipursky said. “That is a huge vindication of the plaintiff.” Merck’s stock rose 26 cents on Thursday, closing at $38.92. In the Texas case, three appeals court judges reversed the verdict of a jury, throwing out the views of the plaintiffs’ experts. In the New Jersey case, the appeals court allowed the basic compensatory damages verdict to stand, but found that the F.D.A.’s pre-emption power barred the jury from awarding punitive damages. It ruled plaintiffs should not have been allowed to allege consumer fraud. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

(AP)  The drug maker Merck has agreed to pay $58 million as part of a multistate settlement of accusations that its ads for the once-popular painkiller Vioxx deceptively played down the health risks. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Vioxx (Drug) The agreement, announced on Tuesday, also calls for Merck to submit all new television commercials for its drugs to the Food and Drug Administration for review. The civil settlement ends investigations by 29 states and the District of Columbia into Merck’s advertising practices involving Vioxx, Pennsylvania’s attorney general, Tom Corbett, said. Vioxx was taken off the market in 2004 after research showed it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. That led to thousands of lawsuits against Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J. A pending $4.85 billion settlement would end the bulk of those personal injury suits. Thanks to aggressive marketing through direct-to-consumer television ads begun in 1999, hundreds of thousands of consumers demanded Vioxx prescriptions before doctors had a chance to understand the side effects, Mr. Corbett said. An F.D.A. spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone message on Tuesday seeking comment. Merck is not admitting any wrongdoing under the settlement and defended its marketing of Vioxx in a statement on Tuesday. The agreement calls for Merck to submit all new television commercials for its drugs to the agency for seven years. The F.D.A. is to review them, and Merck is to abide by any changes the agency recommends. For a 10-year period, Merck must also comply with any F.D.A. recommendations to delay television ads for newly approved pain medications. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

A Texas jury awarded $32 million to the widow of 71-year-old Leonel Garza in April 2006. That later was cut to about $7.75 million under damage caps in the state. On Wednesday, the Fourth Court of Appeals in Texas overturned the verdict, ruling that Mr. Garza’s family had not proved that his use of Vioxx caused blood clots that the family’s lawyers argued resulted in his heart attack. The opinion was signed by Justice Sandee Bryan Marion. Mr. Garza died after taking Vioxx for less than a month. During the trial, Merck lawyers argued that Mr. Garza’s heart attack was a result of his 23 years of heart disease. “Today’s decision reaffirms that there is simply no reliable scientific evidence that Vioxx caused Mr. Garza’s heart attack,” Theodore V. H. Mayer, a lawyer for Merck, said in a statement. After the trial, a juror admitted borrowing money from Mr. Garza’s widow, although that did not seem to have been a factor in the appellate court decision. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., withdrew Vioxx from the market in September 2004 after research showed that the painkiller doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. That set off an avalanche of lawsuits against Merck, which has a $4.85 billion settlement pending to end the bulk of the personal injury suits. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Warns Merck About Plant<date>Published: May 1, 2008</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration has ordered Merck &amp; Company to correct numerous manufacturing deficiencies at its main vaccine plant, the agency said Wednesday. The agency released a warning letter sent to Merck’s chief executive, Richard T. Clark, that states its inspectors had determined that manufacturing rules were not being followed at the plant in West Point, Pa., just outside Philadelphia. The plant, which recalled two vaccines in December over sterility problems, makes a number of children’s vaccines and four for adults. The nine-page letter states that the agency found “significant objectionable conditions” in the manufacture of vaccines and drug ingredients during repeated inspections from Nov. 26 to Jan. 17. In a separate posting on its Web site, the agency said it had issued the warning letter because Merck’s response to the F.D.A. report sent after the inspections was “inadequate to address the serious deviations noted.” The F.D.A. said in the posting that it “does not believe that the issues identified will affect the safety of the vaccines” made at West Point, or their availability. Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Merck, said, “We’re committed to working with the F.D.A. to ensure that all these issues are addressed to their full satisfaction.” More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Merck said the agency issued a “not approvable” letter, stating that it needed more information on the drug, Cordaptive, a cholesterol treatment that Merck had long promoted as a crucial addition to its lucrative cholesterol franchise, which has been under fire this year. The cholesterol drug, also known as MK-0524A, can both lower LDL, or bad cholesterol, and raise HDL, or good cholesterol, Merck says. “We plan to meet with the F.D.A. and to submit additional information to enable the agency to further evaluate” the drug’s risks and benefits, Peter S. Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement. Merck disclosed the agency’s action after the close of market trading, and its stock fell 5 percent, to $39.35 a share, in after-hours trading on Monday. Merck’s former cholesterol blockbuster, Zocor, lost billions in annual sales after it faced generic competition in 2006. The company, and a partner, the Schering-Plough Corporation of Kenilworth, N.J., jointly sell two other cholesterol drugs, Zetia and Vytorin, which combines Zetia and Zocor. The drug makers have been accused of trying to protect sales by delaying results of a study that showed Vytorin worked no better than Zocor, which is much cheaper; the companies deny the accusation. Cordaptive combines an extended-release form of the B vitamin niacin with a chemical to inhibit a niacin side effect called flushing  redness, burning and tingling of the face. Niacin has been used to control cholesterol for decades, and an extended-release version called Niaspan, made by Abbott Laboratories, has been on sale for years. In a 24-week study of about 1,600 patients, reported at a European cardiology conference in the fall, researchers found that compared with dummy pills, Cordaptive produced an 18 percent decline in levels of LDL cholesterol, a 26 percent decline in another type of blood fat called triglycerides and a 20 percent increase in HDL levels. Merck also said that the F.D.A. rejected Cordaptive as a brand name, so it may use the name Tredaptive in the United States. The company noted that an advisory committee on Thursday recommended that European Union countries approve the drug. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Lilly also reported disappointing sales of its Byetta diabetes drug, while Novartis and Merck, like much of the industry, are dealing with patent expirations and generic competition for some of their important medicines. Novartis benefited from the weak dollar as well as its cost-cutting program in posting a net profit of $2.13 billion that easily surpassed analyst forecasts of $1.83 billion. Merck earned $3.3 billion, or $1.52 a share, up from $1.7 billion, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Merck earned 89 cents a share, topping analysts' average forecast by 3 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. A Bear Stearns analyst, John Boris, said Merck's cost of goods sold was $109 million less than he had expected and taxes were $314 million less, helping to offset revenue weakness. Merck experienced plunging sales of its Fosamax osteoporosis drug, now facing generic competition; slowing sales growth of cholesterol drugs it shares with Schering-Plough; and lower-than-expected sales of its Gardasil vaccine to prevent the virus that causes cervical cancer. Lilly earned $1.06 billion, or 97 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with $508.7 million, or 47 cents a share, a year before. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 92 cents, missing Wall Street expectations by 4 cents. It did see solid sales growth in its antidepressant Cymbalta, the insulin drugs Humalog and Humulin and the impotence treatment Cialis. ''Lilly missed because its sales, general and administrative expenses were higher than expected, and we didn't get the expected amount of growth from Byetta,'' said an Edward Jones analyst, Linda Bannister. Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort cited Novartis's better-than-expected cost containment, especially in cost of goods sold, as a factor in mitigating the loss of the blood pressure medicine Lotrel, which is facing generic competition, and the bowel drug Zelnorm, which was withdrawn from the American market because of safety concerns. Both Merck and Lilly reaffirmed their full-year earnings forecasts, excluding items. Lilly expects $3.85 to $4 a share, reflecting growth of as much as 13 percent; Merck expects to earn $3.28 to $3.38, on growth of no more than 6 percent. Pharmaceutical shares have been hit hard this year, and midway through first-quarter earnings reporting season there appeared to be little reason for investors to jump back in. Most good news was driven by cost-cutting and foreign exchange benefits, rather than fundamentals. The weak dollar was largely responsible for the better-than-expected first quarter that Johnson &amp; Johnson reported last week. Pfizer reported a worse-than-expected drop in quarterly profit last week, mostly because of high operating expenses that were only partly offset by aggressive cost-cutting. Novartis shares closed up 3 percent in Switzerland. On the New York Stock Exchange, Merck was off 13 cents to $39.63, while Lilly shares were down $2.48, or 4.7 percent, to $49.54.</text></article>

Plan on Medical Articles Takes More Heat<date>Published: April 19, 2008</date><text>The pharmaceutical industry glimpsed its own ghost this week, and the apparition could not have arrived at a worse time for drug makers. Skip to next paragraph Related Merck Wrote Drug Studies for Doctors (April 16, 2008) A report indicating that Merck used ghostwriters to produce medical journal articles in support of its subsequently discredited drug Vioxx has galvanized opponents to a federal proposal that would relax some restrictions on drug promotion. The Food and Drug Administration has been considering a proposal to let drug makers use reprints of journal articles in promoting drugs for so-called off-label uses the F.D.A. itself has not approved. A main proviso of the proposal is that the articles must have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals. The Vioxx report, published Wednesday by a leading medical journal, JAMA, has, however, raised new questions about the validity of many published research studies, even in peer-reviewed publications. Opposition to the F.D.A. proposal has come from a diverse group that includes Public Citizen, New York State’s health commissioner and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a trade association of 39 major health insurance plans. The pharmaceutical industry is supporting the F.D.A. proposal. A working group of 10 major companies has enlisted the agency’s former chief legal counsel, Daniel E. Troy, to push the industry position. In a news briefing in Washington on Thursday, the group presented its case that off-label uses of drugs and medical devices are necessary because scientists discover possible uses for new medical products before the F.D.A. has time to review them. Among other supporters of the F.D.A. proposal are the National Organization for Rare Disorders and the National Alliance of Mental Illness. Dr. Kenneth Duckworth, medical director for the mental illness association, said that using drugs off-label is “one of the realities of treating people with illnesses that we don’t fully understand.” Ghostwritten articles had been raised as a reason for concern about the proposal even before Wednesday’s article appeared in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. In a letter to the F.D.A. on March 21, the Blue Cross association’s vice president, Dr. Allan M. Korn, cited the possibility that ghostwritten articles could be used to bolster off-label uses of drugs. The New York State health commissioner, Dr. Richard F. Daines, also wrote the F.D.A. on April 8 about his concerns of possible pharmaceutical industry manipulation of peer-reviewed journals and how those articles could be used to promote off-label uses. His letter referred to the apparent misuse of journal articles in the off-label promotion of the epilepsy drug Neurontin. It was estimated that in 2002 more than 90 percent of Neurontin sales were for other off-label purposes, Dr. Daines’ letter said. Pfizer paid a $430 million fine in 2004 to resolve criminal and civil charges over off-label promotion of the drug. After the JAMA article about Vioxx appeared this week, Dr. Daines said in a telephone interview that disclosures about Merck “points out the potential weakness” in the F.D.A. proposal. “We just have so many concerns,” Dr. Daines said in a telephone interview Thursday. “You don’t know the publication’s true peer-review standards and transparency.” Vioxx, a painkiller, was a best-selling drug before it was withdrawn from the market in 2004 following disclosure that it increased the risk of heart attacks. Last fall, Merck announced that it had agreed to pay $4.85 billion to resolve tens of thousands of Vioxx-related lawsuits. Although off-label marketing was not an issue with Vioxx, the JAMA paper asserted that Merck had drafted dozens of research studies for Vioxx, then lined up prestigious doctors to put their names on the reports before publication. The article, based on documents unearthed in lawsuits contending that Vioxx caused heart attacks, cited one draft of a Vioxx study that needed a big-name researcher, identifying the lead author as “External author?” Merck has vigorously denied that the doctors named as authors on Vioxx papers did not play an integral role in producing the articles. The lead author of the JAMA article, Dr. Joseph S. Ross of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, said this week that his findings helped highlight flaws in the F.D.A. proposal’s reliance on peer-reviewed journals to provide the evidence supporting off-label drug use. “What does it mean to be peer-reviewed,” Dr. Ross said, “if the company has essentially conceived the article, composed the draft and written the paper?” Although the drug industry has generally not been permitted to promote drugs for off-label uses, physicians are allowed to prescribe federally approved products for any purposes as they see fit, and an estimated 20 percent of prescriptions are for off-label uses. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, head of Public Citizen’s health research group, said his organization was concerned about the proposed F.D.A. rule change. “It’s one thing if a doctor on her or his own chooses to prescribe it,” Dr. Wolfe said. “It’s another thing for the company to be promoting a drug for which there isn’t evidence that the benefits outweigh the risks.” Drug makers have previously been allowed to distribute reprints of articles supporting off-label uses, but only with F.D.A. permission and only if they were also formally seeking approval of those uses. Alan R. Bennett, a lawyer representing the industry coalition, said the old requirement was too burdensome. “That essentially required companies to promise to spend tens of millions of dollar to disseminate an article,” Mr. Bennett said. After that law lapsed in 2006, the rules reverted to a prohibition on distribution of articles. But the industry said court rulings had made the legality of that prohibition unclear. The new proposal requires that the articles published in peer-reviewed journals not be misleading. And they must also be circulated with a warning that the off-label use is not approved by the F.D.A. Mr. Bennett said the industry group believed that the peer-review process was adequate, particularly because the F.D.A. is currently overburdened and prosecutors have rigorously monitored inappropriate off-label promotion. Representative Henry A. Waxman, a Democrat from California, complained last year that the F.D.A. proposal would also remove incentives for drug makers to sponsor clinical trials of drugs for new uses.

Skip to next paragraph Related JAMA Article: "Guest Authorship and Ghostwriting in Publications Related to Rofecoxib" Blogrunner: Reactions From Around the Web The article, based on documents unearthed in lawsuits over the pain drug Vioxx, provides a rare, detailed look in the industry practice of ghostwriting medical research studies that are then published in academic journals. The article cited one draft of a Vioxx research study that was still in want of a big-name researcher, identifying the lead writer only as “External author?” Vioxx was a best-selling drug before Merck took it off the market in 2004 over evidence linking it to heart attacks. Last fall, the company agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve tens of thousands of lawsuits filed by former Vioxx patients or their families. The lead author of Wednesday’s article, Dr. Joseph S. Ross of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said a close look at the Merck documents raised broad questions about the validity of much of the drug industry’s published research, because the ghostwriting practice appears to be widespread. “It almost calls into question all legitimate research that’s been conducted by the pharmaceutical industry with the academic physician,” said Dr. Ross, whose article, written with colleagues, was published Wednesday in JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association. and posted Tuesday on the journal’s Web site. Merck acknowledged on Tuesday that it sometimes hired outside medical writers to draft research reports before handing them over to the doctors whose names eventually appear on the publication. But the company disputed the article’s conclusion that the authors do little of the actual research or analysis. The final work is the product of the doctor and “accurately reflects his or her opinion,” said a Merck lawyer, James C. Fitzpatrick. And at least one of the doctors whose published research was questioned in Wednesday’s article, Dr. Steven H. Ferris, a New York University psychiatry professor, said the notion that the article bearing his name was ghostwritten was “simply false.” He said it was “egregious” that Dr. Ross and his colleagues had done no research besides mining the Merck documents and reading the published journal articles. In an editorial, JAMA said the analysis showed that Merck had apparently manipulated dozens of publications to promote Vioxx. “It is clear that at least some of the authors played little direct roles in the study or review, yet still allowed themselves to be named as authors,” the editorial said. The editorial called upon medical journal editors to require each author to report his or her specific contributions to articles. “Journal editors also bear some of the responsibility for enabling companies to manipulate publications,” the editorial said. JAMA itself published one of the Vioxx studies that was cited in Dr. Ross’s article. In that case, in 2002, a Merck scientist was listed as the lead author. But Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis, JAMA’s editor, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that, even so, it was dishonest because the authors did not fully disclose the role of a ghostwriter. “I consider that being scammed,” Dr. DeAngelis said. “But is that as serious as allowing someone to have a review article written by a for-profit company and solicited and paid for by a for-profit company and asking you to put your name on it after it was all done?” Although the role of pharmaceutical companies in influencing medical journal articles has been questioned before, the Merck documents provided the most comprehensive look at the practice yet, according to one of the study’s four authors, Dr. David S. Egilman, a clinical associate medical professor at Brown University. In the Vioxx lawsuits, millions of Merck documents were supplied to plaintiffs. Those documents were available to Dr. Egilman and Dr. Ross because they had served as consultants to plaintiffs’ lawyers in some of those suits. Combing through the documents, Dr. Ross and his colleagues unearthed internal Merck e-mail messages and documents about 96 journal publications, which included review articles and reports of clinical studies. While the Ross team said it was not necessarily raising questions about all 96 articles, it said that in many cases there was scant evidence that the recruited authors made substantive contributions. One paper involved a study of Vioxx as a possible deterrent to Alzheimer’s progression. The draft of the paper, dated August 2003, identified the lead writer as “External author?” But when it was published in 2005 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, the lead author was listed as Dr. Leon J. Thal, a well-known Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Thal was killed in an airplane crash last year. The second author listed on the published Alzheimer’s paper, whose name had not been on the draft, was Dr. Ferris, the New York University professor. Dr. Ferris, reached by telephone Tuesday, said he had played an active role in the research and he was substantially involved in helping shape the final draft. “It’s simply false that we didn’t contribute to the final publication,” Dr. Ferris said. A third author, also not named on the initial draft, was Dr. Louis Kirby, currently the medical director for the company Provista Life Sciences. In an e-mail message on Tuesday, Dr. Kirby said that as a clinical investigator for the study he had enrolled more patients, 109, than any of the other researchers. He also said he made revisions to the final document. “The fact that the draft was written by a Merck employee for later discussion by all the authors does not in and of itself constitute ghostwriting,” Dr. Kirby’s e-mail message said. The current editor of the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, Dr. James H. Meador-Woodruff, the chairman of psychiatry at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said he was not the editor in 2005 but planned to investigate the accusations. “Currently, we have in place prohibitions against this,” Dr. Meador-Woodruff said.

Democratic leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to the companies on Friday asking why minutes from a November meeting about the blockbuster cholesterol drug were created after the fact, in December. The five-member panel of medical advisers were told that no minutes or transcript of the meeting would be taken, the lawmakers noted. The committee chairman, John D. Dingell, and the chairman of the subcommittee for oversight, Bart Stupak, both from Michigan, are investigating how Merck and Schering-Plough handled data comparing Merck’s Zocor against their new cholesterol drug Vytorin. The study was completed in 2006 and showed that Vytorin was no better at limiting plaque buildup in neck arteries than Zocor, which is now available as a low-cost generic. But the companies did not release those results until January. E-mail messages released by the congressmen on Friday show James Stein, a University of Wisconsin professor, objecting to Merck’s recollection of the Nov. 16 meeting. “I still have a hard time calling this document ‘minutes,’ ” Mr. Stein wrote in an e-mail message to Merck executives. “They at best are an incomplete summary of what transpired at the meeting.” Mr. Stein took issue with Merck’s statement that panelists unanimously recommended changing an important goal of the Vytorin study.

Most of the patients had been pretreated with lipid-lowering therapy, which potentially limited the amount that plaque buildup could have been reduced with further LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy. Investigators said this was one of the possible explanations of the results. As to why it took as long as it did to complete the study, we want to point out that the Merck and Schering-Plough joint venture disclosed the primary results in a public news release just two weeks after the study data were first unblinded. The study itself took longer to complete than we had anticipated because of unexpected challenges in reading and analyzing the blinded data. We have made available on our Web sites a very detailed chronology of events related to this study. While we are disappointed with the results, it is important to note that in this study and many others, these medicines did what the Food and Drug Administration has approved them to do: lower bad cholesterol.

These drugs were supposed to offer a valuable alternative to the older cholesterol-lowering agents known as statins, a class that includes Lipitor, Zocor and other drugs that not only reduce cholesterol but also reduce the risk of heart attacks. In clinical trial results released this week, the newer drugs failed to reach their main goal: slowing the growth of artery-clogging plaques  a suggestion that they might not help ward off heart attacks. Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » It is distressingly late to be learning that these drugs may provide little or no benefit. They were approved on the basis of evidence that they reduce the level of so-called bad cholesterol in the blood. That data was taken as presumptive evidence that the drugs would reduce heart-attack risks. Despite this slim supporting data, vigorous promotion propelled them to combined sales of more than $5 billion last year, placing them among the world’s top-selling drugs. An analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the drugs captured 15.2 percent of the cholesterol-lowering market in this country, driven by an advertising campaign aimed at consumers and aggressive marketing to doctors. But they claimed only 3.4 percent of the market in Canada, where advertising to consumers is prohibited, Vytorin is unavailable and public programs restrict usage. These are drugs that became blockbusters thanks to marketing muscle, not scientific proof of effectiveness. There are also justifiable concerns that Merck and Schering-Plough, the companies that make the drugs, may have sat on adverse data for more than a year lest their sales be undermined. In e-mail messages unearthed by Senate investigators, the lead scientist on the study warned that repeated delays in releasing the results made it look as if the company was trying to hide something. In the clinical trial, 720 European patients with genes that cause abnormally high cholesterol levels were given either Vytorin, a combination pill that contains both Zetia and Zocor, or simply Zocor alone. As expected, the combination pill proved better than the statin alone at reducing the level of bad cholesterol. But to everyone’s surprise, Vytorin failed to slow the growth of fatty plaques in the arteries, and it may have even allowed greater growth than the statin did. Vytorin and Zetia are clearly down, but not necessarily out. It remains possible, for example, that the reason Vytorin had little effect in reducing plaque was that most of these patients had been taking statins for years and their plaque had already been depleted to the point that Vytorin had little room to improve the situation. It is also possible, however, that Vytorin and Zetia are simply less effective than the statins. Other trials now under way may clarify Vytorin’s value in coming years. Meanwhile, heart experts are surely right that Vytorin and Zetia should be a last resort for patients who can’t get their cholesterol down any other way. More Articles in Opinion »</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/01drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">Accusations of Delays in Releasing Drug Results<date>Published: April 1, 2008</date><text>CHICAGO  The lead outside investigator on a crucial trial of two widely used heart drugs said in an e-mail message last July that Merck and Schering-Plough, the companies that make the drugs, were deliberately delaying the release of the trial results “to hide something.” The companies did not release the preliminary results of the trial, called Enhance, until January, almost two years after the trial was finished. When they were finally released, the trial’s results showed that the drugs, Vytorin and Zetia, did not work to reduce plaque in arteries. The results led a panel of cardiologists to recommend on Sunday that the drugs be used only as a last resort. The new information was contained in e-mail messages to executives at Schering-Plough that were released Monday by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. The committee has been investigating the delay in the release of the Enhance trial results. It is likely to inflame the controversy over the way that Merck and Schering-Plough handled the Enhance trial, as well as their heavy promotion of Vytorin and Zetia. The drugs are used to lower cholesterol and are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the United States, with sales of $5 billion last year. Shares of Merck and Schering plunged on Monday. The Enhance investigator, Dr. John J. P. Kastelein, also complained last July that Merck and Schering had not consulted him on the reasons for the delay and threatened to resign as the main study investigator. A spokeswoman for Schering-Plough said the messages had been presented out of context and that Dr. Kastelein’s complaints had been resolved months ago. Zetia lowers cholesterol by blocking its absorption in the intestine. Vytorin combines Zetia with simvastatin, another cholesterol-lowering drug sold under the brand name Zocor. Dr. Kastelein is a Dutch cardiologist and scientist whom Merck and Schering hired to conduct the Enhance trial, which consisted of images of the arteries of 720 patients taking either Vytorin  the combination of Zetia and Zocor  or Zocor alone. Because Vytorin lowers cholesterol more than Zocor alone, the companies expected that the trial would show that patients who took Vytorin had less growth of plaque in their arteries than those who took Zocor. Arterial plaque is closely correlated with heart attack and strokes. The trial ended in April 2006, and its results were initially expected in late 2006 or early 2007. The companies repeatedly delayed releasing the results of the trial, however, saying publicly that many of the images of the arteries were unclear and might need to be re-examined. By July 2007, Dr. Kastelein was privately furious with the companies for the delays, his messages show. “Is it correct that SP has decided not to present at AHA?” he said July 6 in an e-mail message to Dr. Rick Veltri, a vice president at the Schering-Plough Research Institute, referring to the American Heart Association conference in November. “If this is the case, our collaboration is over,” he wrote, adding, “This starts smelling like extending the publication for no other [than] political reasons and I cannot live with that.” The next day, according to the text of the messages released by Senator Grassley, Dr. Kastelein complained that the companies seemed to be trying to slow the release of the results by including data that was not relevant and would take more time to compile. By doing so, he wrote, “you will be seen as a company that tries to hide something and I will be perceived as being in bed with you!” Dr. Kastelein did not respond to requests for comment. Rosemarie Yancosek, a spokeswoman for Schering, said, “The e-mails selectively excerpted in the letter concern an issue that Merck-Schering-Plough and  we believe, also Dr. Kastelein  consider long resolved.” Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, said Dr. Kastelein’s messages raised new concerns over the nearly two-year delay in the release of the Enhance results. “What raises concerns here is the possibility that the delay was being imposed by the companies against the wishes of the principal investigator, who should be the leader of the study,” Dr. Krumholz said. “I hope that there was a good scientific explanation, endorsed by a steering committee of credible scientists at the time of the decision to delay, which explains why the public and the profession had to wait so long.” On Sunday, Dr. Krumholz and three other cardiologists told an audience of more than 5,000 people at the annual American College of Cardiology scientific convention that Vytorin and Zetia should not be used except as a last resort. The two major cardiology associations seconded those recommendations on Monday, leading to a plunge in shares of Merck and Schering. Merck fell $6.56, or 15 percent, to $37.95. Schering, which is smaller and even more dependent on profits from Zetia and Vytorin, fell $5.06, or 26 percent, to $14.41. Prescriptions for the medicines have already dipped about 15 percent since January, when preliminary results from the Enhance trial were first disclosed. Still, the drugs are widely used, with about three million prescriptions written each month in the United States alone. LDL cholesterol, the harmful kind, is known as a risk factor for heart disease, and so doctors have generally assumed that lowering LDL cholesterol by any means would reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. But proving that a drug actually cuts those risks requires an expensive, multiyear clinical trial enrolling 10,000 or more patients. Those studies, called outcomes trials, have been conducted for statins, and they have proved that patients taking those drugs do have a reduced risk of heart disease. No such outcomes trials exist for Vytorin and Zetia. In 2006, four years after Zetia reached the market, Merck and Schering began enrolling patients in their own outcomes study, which compares people taking Vytorin with those taking Zocor alone. But the results of the trial are not likely to be available until 2012, or possibly later. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Instead, doctors and patients should rely more heavily on older cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, which have proven benefits and can be cheaper, the panel said. ''The strongest recommendation we can make on this panel is to go back to statins,'' said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale. ''They work.'' Statins include drugs like Lipitor and simvastatin, the generic version of Zocor. But other, lesser-known drugs like the vitamin niacin should also be tried before Vytorin and Zetia, the panel said. Vytorin and Zetia are among the top-selling drugs in the world, with combined sales of $5 billion last year. About five million people, including four million Americans, take the medicines, which have been heavily advertised to consumers in the United States. The New England Journal of Medicine made a similar recommendation about the drugs in an editorial published Sunday. The panel and the editorial were timed to coincide with the release of full results from a two-year clinical trial that showed that the drugs did not slow, and might speed up, the growth of fatty plaques in arteries. Those plaques are associated with heart attacks and strokes. Merck and Schering-Plough, which make Vytorin and Zetia, said Sunday that they disagreed with the recommendations. Vytorin and Zetia have been proved to lower cholesterol and are valuable treatments for patients, said Dr. Rick Veltri, vice president of the Schering-Plough Research Institute. ''We feel that nothing's changed,'' Dr. Veltri said. The stakes of the debate are high both medically and financially. The drugs produce about 70 percent of Schering-Plough's profit, analysts say. Prescriptions for the medicines have already dipped about 15 percent since January, when preliminary results were disclosed from the trial discussed in detail on Sunday. Still, the drugs are widely used, with about three million prescriptions written each month in the United States alone. Unlike statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol, Zetia stops the intestine from absorbing cholesterol in food. Vytorin is a single pill that combines Zetia with simvastatin, or Zocor. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, the harmful kind, is a risk factor for heart disease, and so doctors have generally assumed that lowering LDL cholesterol would reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. But proving that a drug actually cuts those risks requires an expensive, multiyear clinical trial involving 10,000 or more patients. Those studies, called outcomes trials, have been conducted for statins, and they have proved that patients taking those drugs have a reduced risk of heart disease. No such outcomes trials exist for Vytorin and Zetia. The Food and Drug Administration initially approved Zetia in 2002 on the basis of trials that lasted no more than 12 weeks and covered only 3,900 patients. In 2006, four years after Zetia reached the market, Merck and Schering began enrolling patients in their own outcomes study, which compares people taking Vytorin to those taking Zocor alone. But the companies said Friday that the results of the trial, which had been expected in 2011, would not come until at least 2012. As a result, doctors who prescribe the medicines are doing so without hard evidence that they help patients, said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. ''We've got a drug that has no clinical outcome trials,'' Dr. Nissen said. ''I advise my colleagues essentially to use this drug only as a last resort.'' The recommendations released Sunday will probably have an immediate impact on clinical practice, said Dr. Douglas Weaver, the incoming president of the American College of Cardiology, which was host of the conference. Nearly half of the 30,000 cardiologists in the United States are attending the conference, and many of them heard the panel's recommendations firsthand. Heavy marketing probably contributed to the drugs' overuse, Dr. Weaver said. But use will decline as more patients and doctors focus on the results of the Enhance trial. ''Sometimes you have to tell people multiple times before they get the message,'' he said.</text></article>

The agency said it was reviewing a handful of reports involving mood changes, suicidal behavior and suicide in patients who had taken Singulair, the popular allergy and asthma drug. Merck has updated the drug's labeling four times in the last year to include information on a range of reported side effects, including tremors, anxiousness, depression and suicidal behavior. The F.D.A. said it had asked the company, based in Whitehouse, N.J., to dig deeper into its data on Singulair for evidence of possible links to suicide. The agency said it had not established a ''causal relationship'' between Merck's drug and suicidal behavior. An agency spokeswoman said the review was prompted by three or four suicide reports it had received since last October. It could take up to nine months before agency scientists can draw any conclusions, the F.D.A. said in a posting to its Web site. Merck officials stressed that the agency's inquiry was based on reports, not clinical studies, which are the standard tool for evaluating drug safety. The company said none of the 11,000 patients enrolled in 40 Singulair trials had committed suicide. Millions of patients in the United States take Singulair, which was first approved in 1998 and had sales of $4.3 billion last year.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/business/04vioxx.html?ref=merckandcompany">Vioxx Settlement on Track as 44,000 Sign Up<date>Published: March 4, 2008</date><text>NEW ORLEANS (AP)  More than 44,000 people have signed up for a piece of a $4.85 billion settlement over the withdrawn painkiller Vioxx, a sign that the deal is on track to go forward, the drug’s maker, Merck &amp; Company, announced Monday. Of roughly 47,000 people who registered for the settlement this year, more than 44,000 have submitted all or some of the paperwork necessary for enrollment in the deal, Merck said. People who enrolled by Friday could be eligible to receive an interim payment later this year. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., has said it will withdraw from the agreement unless at least 85 percent of people in different groups of claimants join in the settlement. Those thresholds would be met  and exceed 93 percent of eligible claims in each of four main categories  if all of the more than 44,000 submissions are verified, the company said. A lead plaintiffs’ lawyer, Andy Birchfield, said Monday that the enrollment figures were “extremely encouraging.” “These numbers reflect near universal acceptance of the program,” Mr. Birchfield said. In addition to the 44,000, another 5,000 claimants whose eligibility is less certain have also submitted paperwork for enrollment, according to Merck. “Counting and verification is still going on,” said a company spokesman, Kent Jarrell. “We really can’t estimate at this point when we’ll have more information.” Lawyers for Merck and thousands of people who blamed Vioxx for their heart attacks or strokes announced the settlement in November 2007. The deal was expected to end an estimated 45,000 to 50,000 state and federal lawsuits. Merck voluntarily took Vioxx off the market in 2004 after its own study showed the painkiller doubled the risk of heart attack when taken for at least 18 months. Vioxx accounted for $2.5 billion of Merck’s 2003 sales and an estimated 15 percent of the company’s profit that year. Shares of Merck fell 24 cents Monday, to $44.06.

Riding horses, flinging softballs, bashing away on drum sets: on the television commercials, they are pugnacious and utterly winning. They want to be “One Less,” they chant — one less victim of cervical cancer. Get vaccinated with Gardasil, they urge their sisters. Protect yourselves against the human papillomavirus, or H.P.V., which causes cervical cancer. But someone’s missing from this grrlpower tableau. Ah, that would be Gardasil Boy. Gardasil Girl’s cancer-related virus? Sexually transmitted. She almost certainly got it from him. So far, Gardasil is approved just for girls. They can be vaccinated when they are as young as 9, although it’s recommended for 11- and 12-year-olds, before they are sexually active. As the commercials show, the pitch to Gardasil Girl’s parents doesn’t need to address sex: it’s about protecting their daughter from a cancer. By 2009, the vaccine could be approved for boys as well. Although Gardasil also protects against genital warts, which are not life-threatening, the primary reason to extend approval to boys would be to slow the rates of cervical cancer. Public health folks charmlessly call this “herd immunity.” Will parents of sons consent to a three-shot regimen that has been marketed as benefiting girls? How do you pitch that to Gardasil Boy’s parents? Think altruism. Responsibility. Chivalry, even? Oh, and yes: some explicit details about genital warts and sexual transmission. Madeline Cattell, an interior design consultant in Beverly, Mass., and the mother of two boys, ages 8 and 12, never paid much attention to Gardasil, assuming it was a gender-specific vaccine for a gender-specific disease. She was surprised that her boys might be offered it one day. “You don’t want to say it’s just the girls’ problem,” Mrs. Cattell said hesitantly. “But my sons won’t contract cervical cancer. And genital warts are treatable. I’m very skeptical. What risks will I expose them to?” Gardasil got off to a rocky start. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006, for girls and young women, ages 9 to 26, it came under attack for its high cost. Conservative groups feared it would encourage promiscuity. But buoyed by recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Merck has distributed 13 million doses in the United States alone; insurance picked up much of the tab. In 2007, worldwide sales of Gardasil brought in $1.5 billion. Gardasil protects against four types of H.P.V. Two have been found in 70 percent of cervical cancer cases. The other two types account for 90 percent of genital warts, which affect both men and women. Immunization gives protection for five years. Sometime this year, Merck will submit data to the F.D.A. seeking approval to give Gardasil to boys. In Australia, Mexico and countries in the European Union, the vaccine is approved for boys. “We have a very clear benefit that we offer to men,” said Dr. Richard M. Haupt, Merck’s executive director of clinical research, referring to the warts, “even if they don’t feel they need to have an altruistic reason to get the vaccine.” Of course, many parents will automatically dismiss Gardasil. They view Big Pharma in general and new vaccines in particular with suspicion. Barbara Goodstein, a Manhattan insurance executive, who has a daughter, 10, and a son, 12, plans to refuse the vaccine for both. “I wouldn’t give children that young a shot without multiple generations of research,” she said. A competing vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline to protect females between the ages of 10 and 55, is being reviewed by the F.D.A. The company is studying its vaccine, Cervarix, in boys as well as girls in Finland. Cervarix does not protect against genital warts. Boys are being included in the trial to see whether vaccinating them will help eradicate cervical cancer. That’s good enough for some mothers. “If there was a vaccine I could take that would get rid of prostate cancer, why wouldn’t I?” said Lisa Lippman, a Manhattan real estate broker with three sons. “If there was a vaccine that sons could get that would get rid of breast cancer, most parents wouldn’t hesitate. But cervical cancer is the ‘sex cancer.’ ” A few reports show that American parents generally favor the Big Idea that Gardasil be made available to both boys and girls. But few surveys discern whether parents would consider the vaccine specifically for their own sons. In 2003, Dr. Elyse Olshen Kharbanda interviewed Boston-area parents. “They didn’t see it as having much benefit for their sons,” said Dr. Kharbanda, now an adolescent specialist at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. “It was smart of Merck to get people excited about it for the girls, but now they’re stuck with that perception.” Cervical cancer, which kills a quarter-million women a year worldwide, has long been a subject of urgent research. In the United States, about 3,700 women die from it each year; screenings like Pap smears have greatly lowered mortality rates here. But H.P.V. also causes a host of precancerous conditions: a study put the annual cost of cervical H.P.V.-related disease at $2.25 billion to $4.6 billion. H.P.V. is the most common sexually transmitted infection. There are estimates of six million new infections in the United States each year. Yet, of more than 100 types of H.P.V., only a handful may result in disease. Most people who are infected have no symptoms and can transmit it unknowingly. At least a half-million Americans each year develop genital warts, which can reoccur. But is Gardasil’s protection against warts enough for parents of sons? “It’s not life-threatening, but it’s very stressful,” said Susan L. Rosenthal, a specialist in adolescent psychology at the University of Texas at Galveston and an adviser to Merck. “Genital warts are a really yucky disease and they make you feel bad about an important, sensitive body part. Psychologically, it’s not an insignificant infection.” Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon, thinks that older boys may see a mix of benefits in Gardasil. “Being able to say to a girl, casually, that you had the shots, boys might think, ‘If I can slip that into the conversation, it makes me less of a risk and seem like more of a humanitarian,’ ” Dr. Fischhoff said. “So the self-interested and altruistic motives could actually support each other." Some doctors even envisioned college kids, gay and straight, insisting partners get vaccinated. Down the road, the vaccine may have other benefits. H.P.V. also causes anal and penile cancers, which are relatively rare, and some head and neck cancers. The burden of explaining genital warts to fifth-grade boys and their parents, as well as spelling out how boys could give girls a virus that could lead to cancer, will largely fall on pediatricians. Dr. Evelyn Hurvitz, a pediatrician in Tonawanda, N.Y., is beginning to map out those Gardasil discussions. “If you have an 11-year-old boy in your office,” she mused, “the last thing he’s thinking about is having sex with a girl. He’s still thinking about getting past talking to a girl.” Tough sell. “Then you have the parent of a 15-year-old boy who might be sexually active,” Dr. Hurvitz continued. “And so I would say, ‘This is a disease he could give to a loved one.’ And then I’ll hear, ‘But our son isn’t sexually active.’ And he’ll be squirming. So I’ll say, ‘Maybe not, but eventually he will be.’ ” Dr. Hurvitz wishes that Gardasil had been available for boys and girls from the outset: “It would have been easier to get across the idea that this is a vaccine to prevent transmission of H.P.V.,” she said. A few prescient pediatricians are already laying a foundation. The other day, during Cathy Anderson’s 11-year-old son’s annual check-up, the pediatrician mentioned that Gardasil might become available for boys. “He talked about taking responsibility for controlling a communicable disease,” said Mrs. Anderson, a stay-at-home mother in West Lafayette, Ind. “My first reaction was: ‘Well, that makes sense.’ Then I told my son he wouldn’t have to worry about the disease, because he wouldn’t be having sex until he’d been married for a long time.” </text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/business/08merck.html?ref=merckandcompany">Merck to Settle U.S. Claims for $671 Million<date>Published: February 8, 2008</date><text>TRENTON (AP)  Merck will pay $671 million to settle claims it overcharged government health programs for four popular drugs and gave doctors fees and gifts to induce them to prescribe its drugs, federal prosecutors and company officials said Thursday. The overcharges, dating back to the mid-1990s, involved Medicaid programs in all but one state and the District of Columbia, as well as federal health insurance programs at agencies including the Public Health Service and the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. A nationwide investigation by federal prosecutors, prompted partly by a former Merck salesman who turned whistle-blower and a Louisiana doctor who exposed part of the suspected overcharging, resulted in two settlements announced Thursday. In Philadelphia, federal prosecutors said Merck agreed to pay $399 million and interest for improper calculation of Medicaid rebates and its marketing practices. And in New Orleans, the United States attorney’s office said the drug maker agreed to pay $250 million and interest for its rebate practices. The interest payments increase the total payout to $671 million, Merck said. The company said the settlements did not constitute an admission of any liability or wrongdoing. A Merck spokesman, Ronald Rogers, called the case “a disagreement” over the rules of the Medicaid rebate program. “These civil settlements were the best and most appropriate way to resolve these lengthy investigations and bring these matters to closure,” he said. Drug companies are required to report to the government the lowest price for their medicines to ensure that Medicaid programs get the benefit of discounts or rebates on the drugs they buy. Prosecutors said Merck was hiding the steep discounts it gave to hospitals that used a set amount of Merck products and was reporting higher prices to the government. From 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said, Merck also gave money and perks to doctors and other health care professionals to entice them to prescribe Merck drugs, a practice the government called excessive. The Philadelphia case involved pricing programs for the cholesterol drugs Zocor and Mevacor and the painkiller Vioxx, which Merck withdrew from the market in September 2004 because it doubled risk of heart attack and stroke. Those programs ran from 1996 through 2006, Mr. Rogers, the Merck spokesman, said. The Louisiana case involved pricing for the heartburn drug Pepcid from mid-1996 to April 2001, when it was still sold as a prescription drug. “At the time that these pricing programs were in place, Merck believes that it acted in good faith and complied with the regulations that were in place at the time,” Mr. Rogers said. When Merck reported its fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 30, they included a $671 million charge for the anticipated resolution of federal and state civil investigations into past sales and marketing practices.

The announcement provided a positive note as Amgen announced results for 2007, perhaps the toughest year in its history. Sales of its anemia drug Aranesp plunged 25 percent in the fourth quarter and 12 percent for the year because of safety concerns. The company projected that both its revenue and earnings would decline in 2008. Amgen desperately needs the osteoporosis drug, called denosumab, to become a big seller. And with Fosamax scheduled to face cheaper generic competition in two weeks, it was important for denosumab to prove superior. Amgen said its drug, which is injected twice a year, proved about 40 percent superior to weekly Fosamax pills in improving bone mineral density at the hip and was also better at some other locations. It said side effects of the two drugs appear to be similar. ''Simply put, we could not have hoped in this study for better results,'' Amgen's chief executive, Kevin W. Sharer, told analysts on a conference call. The company said full data would be presented at a medical meeting. Still, the important measure for an osteoporosis drug is whether it prevents fractures. This trial, involving 1,189 women followed for a year, was too small and short to determine that. Results comparing denosumab with a placebo in fracture prevention are expected later this year. In its financial results, Amgen said fourth-quarter revenue decreased 2 percent from the period a year earlier, to $3.7 billion, because of the decline in Aranesp sales. For the year, revenue was $14.8 billion, up 4 percent. Earnings, after adjustments, were $1 a share for the quarter, up 11 percent, and $4.29 for the year, up 10 percent. Earnings were helped by layoffs and other cost cutbacks, with the $739 million in restructuring charges not included in the adjusted earnings. Adjusted net income increased 3 percent, to $1.09 billion in the quarter from $1.06 billion in the period a year earlier. Aranesp sales have been severely hurt by concerns that the drug, often used to treat the anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy, could make cancer worse or shorten lives. Warnings were added to the drug's label and Medicare sharply restricted reimbursement. Sales of Aranesp fell 25 percent in the fourth quarter, to $827 million, with a 39 percent decrease in the United States alone. For the year, Aranesp sales fell 12 percent, to $3.61 billion. But Amgen executives said sales seemed to have stabilized. The Food and Drug Administration has scheduled another advisory committee meeting for March that could lead to further restrictions on Aranesp's use. Sales of Epogen, Amgen's older anemia drug, which is used only to treat kidney dialysis patients, held up better. Fourth quarter sales fell 3 percent, to $638 million. For the year, sales dipped 1 percent, to $2.49 billion. For 2008, Amgen said it expected revenue to drop slightly to $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion. It projected adjusted earnings at $4 to $4.30 a share, flat to down compared with the $4.29 in 2007. Shares of Amgen rose $1.37, to $46.12 Thursday, with its announcements coming after the close of regular trading. After hours the stock was up about 4 percent, to $47.90.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/business/24heart.html?ref=merckandcompany">Heart Group Backs Drug Made by Ally<date>Published: January 24, 2008</date><text>After a study last week showed Vytorin, an expensive combination of two drugs for cholesterol, worked no better than cheap Zocor alone in reducing artery plaque that can lead to heart attacks, the American Heart Association came to the drug’s defense. In a statement issued on Jan. 15, the day after the report’s release, the heart association said the study was too limited to draw conclusions about Vytorin’s ability to reduce heart attacks or deaths compared to Zocor alone. The group advised patients not to abruptly stop taking it without consulting their doctors. What the association did not note in its statement, however, was that the group receives nearly $2 million a year from Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, the joint venture that markets Vytorin. Dr. Daniel W. Jones, the president of the American Heart Association, who was quoted in the Jan. 15 statement, said Wednesday that his group did not typically mention its drug company sponsors when issuing news releases with advice to patients. The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans Thursday to send letters to the association and Merck/Schering-Plough asking about their relationship, a spokeswoman for the committee said. A letter will also be sent to the American College of Cardiology, a much smaller group, which also receives drug industry money and which also released a statement last week advising patients not to stop taking Vytorin without consulting their doctors. Both organizations said Wednesday that the industry financing had nothing to do with their statements, which they said they issued in response to public confusion about the meaning of the Vytorin study. Merck/Schering-Plough also said it had played no role in the statements by the two groups. The letters from the Energy and Commerce Committee are part of a broader committee investigation into the research and marketing of Vytorin. Vytorin, which can sell for more than $100 for a 30-day supply, combines the widely used cholesterol-lowering drug Zocor with another cholesterol-lowering drug, Zetia. Zocor alone is available in a generic form that can sell for less than $6 for a 30-day supply. The medical study, called Enhance, was the subject of a front-page article in The New York Times on Jan. 15. The article also reported that Merck and Schering-Plough were being criticized for not releasing results of the Enhance clinical trial sooner. The trial ended in April 2006. The joint venture of the companies, formed in 2000, helps underwrite the budget of the American Heart Association, and its nearly $2 million a year in contributions includes $350,000 to sponsor a cholesterol page on the group’s Web site, according to Dr. Rose Marie Robertson, the association’s chief science officer. Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, the head of the Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, a consumer advocacy group, noted that the drug industry underwrites many professional medical organizations and said such funding raised questions about the groups’ objectivity. “The American Heart Association gets paid and essentially does the company’s bidding,” Dr. Wolfe said. He also criticized the link between the American Heart Association Web site’s “cholesterol” page and another page: “Food &amp; Family, the 2 sources of bad cholesterol.” Only a reader who looks carefully realizes he has moved from a nonprofit site to the site of a corporate drug maker. Another click and the “Food &amp; Family” page viewer is on the Vytorin Web site. Both Dr. Jones and Dr. Robertson, who said the association’s Web site was being changed Wednesday night to make the sponsorship clearer, said the organization strived for transparency on its Web page. “We actually have a policy,” Dr. Robertson said. “You’ve got to have two clicks before you get to any drug information.” Dr. Jones, who is also dean of the school of medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said: “We certainly don’t want to ever give the impression that any content that’s put in any place by a pharmaceutical company is delivered or endorsed by the A.H.A. If there is a lack of clarity on that, I will work with our team to make it clear.” More Articles in Business »</text></article>

They say this approvingly, even enthusiastically. Skip to next paragraph Sidebar Adam Liptaks column about the legal world appears on Tuesdays. Columnist Page &gt;&gt; Related Vioxx Settlement Agreement (Nov. 9, 2007) Amendment to Settlement Agreement (Jan. 17, 2008) Transcript of panel discussion sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and the Federalist Society (Jan. 7, 2008) The idea that lawyers must represent one client at a time, give independent advice, follow instructions and, in general, act with fierce and single-minded loyalty is, these professors say, a lovely idea but an outmoded one. It is something out of the Age of Chivalry, or at least the 20th century. “Speaking of individualized notions of lawyer loyalty is sort of like the mindset of the French military in 1940,” said Richard A. Nagareda, a law professor at Vanderbilt and the author of a recent book called “Mass Torts in a World of Settlement.” Professor Nagareda was speaking at a forum at the American Enterprise Institute this month, and he was explaining why a proposed $4.85 billion settlement of lawsuits concerning the painkiller Vioxx represents progress, even though the deal puts extraordinary pressure on the lawyer-client relationship. “The French generals hunkered down in a series of reinforced bunkers along the German border called the Maginot Line,” Professor Nagareda said. “Meanwhile, the new world of warfare literally blitzed right past them.” If Professor Nagareda and his colleagues have their way, the ideals of the legal profession will collapse before anyone notices they are gone. The new Maginot Line is the Vioxx settlement, and the blitz is on. The first thing to know about the settlement, announced in November, is that it intends to address tens of thousands of individual lawsuits in which people claimed that Vioxx caused their heart attacks and strokes. It is not a class action. The second is that the settlement does not become effective until 85 percent of the plaintiffs sign up. That concept is not particularly controversial, and it is perfectly understandable. Merck &amp; Company, which made Vioxx, wants to settle only if it can buy something like global peace. The third is that the settlement agreement is not between Merck and the plaintiffs, but between Merck and various plaintiffs’ lawyers. And what lawyers promise to do is to settle on behalf of all of their clients or none of them. That is, a lawyer with 100 clients can participate in the settlement only if all 100 agree or if the lawyer fires those clients who will not go along. The reason for that last provision  in profound tension with traditional notions of legal ethics  was that Merck feared that plaintiffs’ lawyers might act in the best interests of the clients who had the strongest cases. Andy D. Birchfield Jr., a plaintiffs’ lawyer who helped negotiate the deal, said at the forum that what Merck wanted to avoid was “cherry picking.” Participating lawyers could not be allowed to settle their weaker cases and keep their stronger ones. “Merck wanted to make sure,” Mr. Birchfield said, “that a lawyer was not gaming the system, holding out a handful of cases in premier venues that would be in their best interest.” That would make perfect sense if the cases belonged to the lawyers. They could trade in their strong cases along with their weak ones and, on average, make out just fine. It makes less sense in the old world, the one in which the client’s interests came first. George M. Cohen, a law professor at the University of Virginia and a critic of the settlement, said that the deal ran afoul of a fundamental ethics rule prohibiting lawyers from promising not to handle certain cases in exchange for settlement money. Worse, Professor Cohen said, it amounts to an antitrust conspiracy in which plaintiffs’ lawyers have ganged up “to coerce claimants into joining the settlement even if they don’t want to do so by depriving them of the ability to be represented by the best qualified lawyers,” as he put it in an informal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission on Jan. 9. Professor Nagareda, he of the Maginot Line, is willing to concede that loyalty to clients has “a long and distinguished tradition.” It is, he said, “deeply ingrained in our civil justice system.” “There is just one problem,” Professor Nagareda added. “The nature of representation in mass litigation, particularly in mass torts, is increasingly bypassing these individualized notions of loyalty.” The reality, he said, is that mass injury claims often have value only in the aggregate. Individual cases are too expensive to litigate against a determined adversary like Merck. But large numbers of claims take on value collectively. Merck and the plaintiffs’ lawyers were still tinkering with the settlement document last week. They added language saying that each plaintiffs’ lawyer was “expected to exercise his or her independent judgment in the best interest of each client individually.” The new language is surprising only in that it needed to be said at all, and it did nothing to alter the fundamental structure of the deal. But it seemed to be enough for the federal judge overseeing the settlement. “I’m satisfied that nothing in the agreement imposes on a lawyer any impermissible restriction on the practice of law,” Judge Eldon E. Fallon of Federal District Court in New Orleans said Friday at a court conference, according to The Associated Press. Professor Nagareda is right that the Merck litigation is different from an ordinary injury case, and he is honest enough to say that its settlement is at odds with traditional ideas about what lawyers do. The solution, though, is not to let money warp the law. If mass injury settlements require different rules of legal ethics, the states can change those rules. And if clients in mass injury cases are hiring lawyers who will not put their interests first, they should be told that up front and not as their lawyers are salivating over the payday of a lifetime.

But now Vytorin is getting attention that is anything but funny. The medicine combines Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering statin, with Zetia, a drug that limits cholesterol's absorption into the body, and the hope was that the combination would make it more effective than either drug standing alone. But last week Vytorin's makers, Merck and Schering-Plough, announced that in a small study it had done no better than Zocor alone in slowing the growth of arterial plaque, which can lead to heart attacks. There's nothing particularly alarming about the findings (unless you're a shareholder, perhaps). But the news set off a panic among patients using cholesterol drugs. One doctor said he assigned a nurse full time to take the calls ''and convince patients not to stop their medicine.'' Another patient argued with his doctor, claiming the study showed that the drug doubled heart attack risk. (It didn't; the study wasn't designed to measure heart attacks.) ''I think this study is being interpreted wrong,'' said Dr. Paul D. Thompson, director of cardiology at Hartford Hospital, who personally uses Zetia and (like most of the doctors quoted in this article) has consulted with makers of cholesterol drugs. He pointed out that Vytorin users did experience a larger drop in cholesterol than the Zocor users. The disappointment was that the decline didn't translate into a bigger benefit in arterial health. ''It didn't show harm,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''There were no more cardiac events, no more side effects. There was just no change.'' The fallout from the study was not limited to Vytorin. It has led to a whole new set of questions for scientists about cholesterol drugs. Is lowering LDL, the ''bad'' cholesterol, all that counts? Or must a drug also raise HDL, the ''good'' cholesterol, and fight inflammation? Adding to the confusion, the Vytorin makers dragged their feet on releasing the results, issued the findings in a press release rather than a medical journal and made a lot of people mad. ''Failed trials are important,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. ''The reason the medical community is upset about the delay in reporting this is that we learn as much from a study that fails as we do from a study that succeeds. People are not happy that we didn't learn about this sooner.'' Dr. Nissen, who says he donates his drug-consulting fees to charity and doesn't take a tax deduction, added that the study raised interesting scientific questions about the differences in cholesterol drugs. The most popular -- the statins, including Lipitor and Zocor -- reduce the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver. In some studies, statins have lowered heart attack risk by 30 percent or more in high-risk patients. Statins also raise HDL levels and have an anti-inflammatory effect. The problem is that statins, particularly at high doses, can have a number of side effects, including muscle pain. Zetia has a smaller anti-LDL effect than statins, and little effect on HDL or inflammation. On the plus side, because it works primarily in the digestive tract, it potentially has fewer side effects. Vytorin, by combining Zocor and Zetia, produces a bigger drop in cholesterol than either drug could do alone, and without a marked increase in side effects. The problem is that there are no long-term studies showing that using the drug translates into fewer heart attacks or strokes. The latest study was a step in that direction. It didn't set out to measure heart attacks or strokes, but it did look at whether Vytorin slowed plaque buildup on artery walls more than a statin alone. It didn't. While it's been reported that the Vytorin users had more plaque than the Zocor users, that's not a scientifically correct reading of the data: the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Most important, perhaps, nothing about the trial undermines the settled wisdom about cholesterol and heart disease. The science still shows that lower cholesterol is better, however you achieve it. ''Every way in which we have lowered LDL in the past'' has been shown to reduce heart attacks and strokes, said Peter Libby, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has consulted with drug companies. ''All of these different routes to lowering bad cholesterol are correlated with a clinical benefit.'' To be sure, not everyone agrees that drugs are the best way to achieve lower cholesterol. But the Vytorin disappointment doesn't ''mean the whole concept is wrong,'' said Dr. Daniel J. Rader, director of the preventive cardiology and lipid clinic at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, who has also consulted with drug companies. ''I firmly believe lowering cholesterol is the most validated, most important way we can reduce our risk of heart disease and stroke. Get your LDL down, and the lower the better.'' In fact, the real lesson of the Vytorin confusion may be exactly what its makers have promoted. ''It actually does get back to what the Vytorin commercials show,'' said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, medical director of the women's heart program at New York University, who does not consult for cholesterol drug companies. ''Cholesterol comes from what you eat and your family history. I always put in a plug for modifying your diet and exercise. It may not bring about as big of a reduction as medication does, but it helps.'' ILLUSTRATIONS (ILLUSTRATIONS BY NOLA LOPEZ)</text></article>

It has been accepted by doctors and used by drug makers to win quick approval for new medicines to reduce cholesterol. But now some prominent cardiologists say the results of two recent clinical trials have raised serious questions about that theory -- and the value of two widely used cholesterol-lowering medicines, Zetia and its sister drug, Vytorin. Other new cholesterol-fighting drugs, including one that Merck hopes to begin selling this year, may also require closer scrutiny, they say. ''The idea that you're just going to lower LDL and people are going to get better, that's too simplistic, much too simplistic,'' said Dr. Eric J. Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, Calif. LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is the so-called bad cholesterol, in contrast to high-density lipoprotein, or HDL. For patients and drug companies, the stakes are enormous. Led by best sellers like Lipitor from Pfizer, cholesterol-lowering medicines, taken by tens of millions of patients daily, are the largest drug category worldwide, with annual sales of $40 billion. Despite widespread use of the drugs, though, heart disease remains the biggest killer in the United States and other industrialized nations, and many people still have cholesterol levels far higher than doctors recommend. As a result, drug companies are investing billions of dollars in experimental new cholesterol-lowering medicines that may eventually be used alongside the existing drugs. If the new questions result in slower approvals, it would be yet another handicap for the drug industry. Because the link between excessive LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular disease has been so widely accepted, the Food and Drug Administration generally has not required drug companies to prove that cholesterol medicines actually reduce heart attacks before approval. They have not had to conduct so-called outcome or events trials beforehand, which are expensive studies that involve thousands of patients and track whether episodes like heart attacks are reduced. So far, proof that a drug lowers LDL cholesterol has generally been enough to lead to approval. Only then does the drug's maker begin an events trial. And until the results of that trial are available, a process that can take several years, doctors and patients must accept the medicine's benefits largely on faith. ''You've got a huge chasm between F.D.A. licensure and a clinical events trial,'' said Dr. Allen J. Taylor, the chief of cardiology at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Nonetheless, the multistep process has worked well for several cholesterol drugs -- including Lipitor and Zocor, which are in a class of drugs known as statins. In those cases, the postapproval trials confirmed that the drugs reduce heart attacks and strokes, adding to confidence about the link between cholesterol and heart disease. Doctors generally believe that the amount by which cholesterol is lowered, not the method of lowering it, is what matters. That continues to be the assumption of Dr. Scott M. Grundy, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who was the chairman of a panel in 2001 that set national guidelines for cholesterol treatment. ''LDL lowering, however it occurs, delays development of coronary atherosclerosis and reduces risk for heart attack,'' Dr. Grundy said this week. In atherosclerosis, plaque builds up in the arteries, eventually leading to blood clots and other problems that cause heart attacks and strokes. In the last 13 months, however, the failures of two important clinical trials have thrown that hypothesis into question. First, Pfizer stopped development of its experimental cholesterol drug torcetrapib in December 2006, when a trial involving 15,000 patients showed that the medicine caused heart attacks and strokes. That trial -- somewhat unusual in that it was conducted before Pfizer sought F.D.A. approval -- also showed that torcetrapib lowered LDL cholesterol while raising HDL, or good cholesterol. Torcetrapib's failure, Dr. Taylor said, shows that lowering cholesterol alone does not prove a drug will benefit patients.</text></article>

The two companies that reap billions from the drug had been cynically sitting on the results for more than a year. Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » The drug, Zetia, and a combination pill that contains it, Vytorin, are made by Merck and Schering-Plough and used by millions of patients. They generated more than $5 billion in sales last year. The companies sponsored a clinical trial of the drug’s effectiveness in hopes that positive results would strengthen their marketing efforts. The trial was conducted in 720 European patients with genes that cause abnormally high cholesterol levels. For two years, the patients received either Zocor, an older cholesterol drug, or Vytorin, a combination of Zocor and Zetia. The assumption was that Vytorin would reduce the growth of fatty plaques  a risk factor for heart attacks and strokes  more than Zocor alone. As it turned out, the plaques grew almost twice as fast in patients taking the Vytorin. There are reasons to be cautious about interpreting these results. The number of patients was relatively small. And many of them may have used different drug treatments for years before entering the trial, possibly diminishing the effectiveness of adding Zetia. The companies’ grudging release of the data has raised disturbing questions. A House committee will explore whether they withheld the results lest they interfere with sales and only released them under pressure from Congress and news media reports. Whatever the committee discovers, the experience is one more argument for why scientists involved in studies sponsored by drug companies must insist on the right to review and release data. A new law that strengthens the penalties for companies that do not release data promptly should help. The findings also raise doubts about the current belief that lowering cholesterol is the key to cardiovascular health. The study showed that Vytorin reduced bad cholesterol significantly more than Zocor alone. The problem was that it failed to reduce the formation of plaque. The companies are conducting three large clinical trials to test whether Vytorin can nevertheless reduce heart attacks and strokes. Results won’t be available until at least 2011. Meanwhile, with no evidence of effectiveness in plaque-reduction, it seems clear that Zetia and Vytorin should be used sparingly, in cases where all other cholesterol drugs have failed.

Skip to next paragraph Related Health Guide: Cholesterol Times Topics: Merck &amp; Company Merck and Schering-Plough, which make the drug, Zetia, and a pill that contains it, Vytorin, said Monday morning that Zetia had failed to benefit patients in a two-year trial that ended in April 2006. Merck and Schering repeatedly missed their own deadlines for reporting the results, leading cardiologists around the world to wonder what the study would show. At the same time, millions of patients have continued taking Zetia and Vytorin. The drug companies blamed the complexity of the data for the delay. Now, barely a month after news articles noted the delay and Congress pressured the companies to disclose the study’s findings, the results are out. In a press release, Merck and Schering said that not only did Zetia fail to slow the accumulation of fatty plaque in the arteries, it actually seemed to contribute to plaque formation  although by such a small amount that the finding could have been a result of chance. Dr. Steven E. Nissen, the chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, said the results were “shocking.” “This is as bad a result for the drug as anybody could have feared,” said Dr. Nissen, a widely published researcher and senior consulting editor to the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Millions of patients may be taking a drug that does not benefit them, raising their risk of heart attacks and exposing them to potential side effects, he said. Patients should not be given prescriptions for Zetia unless all other cholesterol drugs have failed, he said. Both companies’ shares fell Monday. Sales of the two drugs were $5 billion in 2007, and they are important contributors to Merck’s and Schering’s profits. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating the delay, said in a statement Monday that the negative results added to suspicions that the companies had deliberately sat on their findings from the study, which was known as Enhance. “In light of today’s results, which were released nearly two years after the Enhance trial ended, it is easy to conclude that Merck and Schering-Plough intentionally sought to delay the release of this data,” Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, said in the statement. Mr. Stupak is chairman of the committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, said drug companies had a responsibility to release all their trial findings, positive or negative, as quickly as possible  even if the results might hurt sales. “People may have been on this drug without the ability to know that there was additional data that may have thrown into question its effectiveness,” Dr. Krumholz said. “That’s extremely unfortunate, and that’s an understatement.” Lee Davies, a spokesman for Schering, said the delay was unrelated to the negative findings and that the companies had not known the results until two weeks ago. Dr. John Kastelein, a Dutch cardiologist who had conducted the Enhance trial for Merck and Schering, did not return calls or reply to an e-mail message seeking comment. Mr. Davies said that Dr. Kastelein would not comment until he formally presented the results at a cardiology conference in March. In the trial, patients received either Zocor  an older cholesterol drug  or a combination of Zocor and Zetia, in the pill form known as Vytorin. About 60 percent of patients who take Zetia do so in the Vytorin form, which like Zetia is jointly marketed by Merck and Schering. Worldwide, about one million prescriptions are written for Zetia and Vytorin each week, and about five million people are now taking the drugs worldwide. The trial covered 720 patients and lasted two years. While it was relatively small, cardiologists have been eager to see its results because they have far less data on Zetia than on other cholesterol-lowering medicines. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article>

''We can confirm an authorized generic deal for Fosamax has been signed, although specific details of the deal are proprietary,'' said a Merck spokesman, Ron Rogers. Fosamax, with the chemical name alendronate, has annual sales of about $3 billion, making it the world's top-selling osteoporosis drug. Now available in a once-weekly formulation, it was the first member of the widely used family of treatments known as bisphosphonates that inhibit cells called osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue. An authorized generic is a copycat form of a company's branded medicine that is sold through a licensing agreement, usually with a generic-drug manufacturer. Such deals allow the original seller of a branded drug to hold on to more revenue from the medicine once it loses patent protection and becomes prey to competition from generics. An authorized generic can significantly hurt sales of rivals waiting to be introduced once a branded drug's patent lapses. Analysts have said cheaper generics will not only batter sales of Fosamax, but could also hurt another once-weekly bisphosphonate, Actonel, sold by Procter &amp; Gamble and the French drug maker Sanofi-Aventis. Boniva, a newer bisphosphonate sold by Roche Holding and GlaxoSmithKline, is taken only once a month. Barr Pharmaceuticals said Friday that it planned to introduce its generic version of the basic 70-milligram form of Fosamax on Feb. 6.</text></article>

Merck, which entered into an agreement with Addex last month to work on new treatments for Parkinson’s disease, will gain access to an experimental medicine and other compounds that may be tested in additional unspecified conditions. The project with Merck will focus on a brain-signal transmitter linked to functions like mood and motor control. About 1 in 100 people have schizophrenia, which causes hallucinations and distorted thinking. “We have now gained access to a promising drug candidate that potentially allows us to address an area of high medical importance where current therapies are clearly inadequate,” Darryle Schoepp, franchise head for neuroscience at Merck, said in the statement. Under the agreement, Addex will get as much as $455 million in milestone payments for the first product developed for two conditions and as much as $225 million for a second medicine developed for two ailments. The Swiss company will also get royalty payments on any sales of the products. Addex, which in May had the biggest initial public offering by a Swiss drug maker in three years, has an option to jointly market the medicines with Merck in certain European countries.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/business/21vioxx.html?ref=merckandcompany">Some Lawyers Seek Changes in Vioxx Settlement<date>Published: December 21, 2007</date><text>Several plaintiffs’ lawyers have asked the federal judge overseeing the $4.85 billion Vioxx settlement to give them the freedom to keep some of their clients outside the settlement while allowing other clients to accept it. Currently, if the lawyers want any clients to receive money from the settlement, they must recommend the deal to all their clients. That provision was considered a crucial part of the settlement by Vioxx’s maker, the drug company Merck. Theodore V. H. Mayer, a lawyer for Merck, said that the company would oppose the motion and that the settlement had been carefully devised to be fair to plaintiffs and the company. In an emergency motion to Judge Eldon E. Fallon of Federal District Court in New Orleans, the plaintiffs’ lawyers said the provision would prevent them from offering the best independent judgment for each client. Agreeing to the provision might open them to future lawsuits from disgruntled clients, they said. “The settlement agreement, which allows Merck to dictate the advice a lawyer will offer, is improper in all states,” the lawyers wrote in the motion, which was filed Monday. Grant Kaiser, a Houston lawyer who represents about 1,800 plaintiffs, filed the motion. It was signed by 11 other firms that collectively represent another 4,200 plaintiffs  about 10 percent of all the people who have sued Merck over Vioxx. Mr. Kaiser declined to comment on the motion. Merck and several large plaintiffs’ law firms agreed to the settlement last month as a way to resolve more than 50,000 claims from people who assert that Vioxx, a painkiller withdrawn from the market in 2004, caused them to suffer heart attacks and strokes. Merck had won most of the 18 suits that reached juries in both state and federal court. The requirement that lawyers agree to recommend the deal to all their clients  and withdraw from representing those who do not agree  is a crucial part of the agreement. Merck wants lawyers to put all their clients into it so that it will not face the prospect that they will settle their weaker claims while withholding their stronger cases for trial. Merck also wants to be sure that plaintiffs who do choose to go ahead will have to find new lawyers, a process that will probably be difficult because the firms with the most experience in the case are all part of the agreement. “We knew this was a key component, a primary component of the settlement,” said Andy Birchfield, an Alabama lawyer whose firm began suing Merck over Vioxx in 2001. “It had to be a case where the lawyers were not cherry picking.” For the deal to take effect, 85 percent of all plaintiffs, as well as 85 percent of plaintiffs who have stronger cases because they took the drug continuously for more than a year, must agree to its terms. But Benjamin Zipursky, a professor at Fordham Law School who has followed the case, said the all-or-nothing requirement might pose ethical problems. “The question is, Is this really independent advice given to each client if the lawyer obligates himself or herself to say this to all the clients?” Mr. Zipursky said. Mr. Mayer, the Merck lawyer, said the federal court might not be able to change the settlement, since the Vioxx cases were not being tried as a class action, in which any overall settlement requires judicial approval. He declined to say what the company would do if Judge Fallon ordered the two sides to change the agreement. Mr. Birchfield and other lawyers who have agreed to the deal said they had good reasons to accept the requirement. As a practical matter, plaintiffs will not be well served by bringing cases to court, given Merck’s strong record, said Christopher A. Seeger, a plaintiffs’ lawyer who was on the negotiating committee that helped devise the deal. “We’ve tried 18 of these cases, and these plaintiffs have lost most of them,” Mr. Seeger said. The motion will be heard in mid-January. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/business/21drug.html?ref=merckandcompany">Data About Zetia Risks Was Not Fully Revealed<date>Published: December 21, 2007</date><text>New evidence shows that the drug makers Merck and Schering-Plough have conducted several studies of their popular cholesterol medicine Zetia that raise questions about its risks to the liver, but the companies have never published those results. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Left Unsaid Partial results of the studies, alluded to in documents on the Food and Drug Administration’s Web site, raise questions about whether Zetia can cause liver damage when used long term with other cholesterol drugs called statins. Most of the millions of people who use Zetia take it along with a statin like Lipitor, Crestor or Zocor. Or they take it in a single pill, Vytorin, that combines Zetia with Zocor. The discovery of the unpublished research comes as Merck and Schering are already under criticism for not yet releasing data from an important Zetia study, called Enhance, that they completed early last year. The Enhance data may also contain important information about Zetia’s liver risks. At least some patients were dropped from the Enhance study after testing revealed that they had elevated liver enzymes, a Schering-Plough spokesman confirmed this week. But a full report on that trial, including the number of patients who had liver problems, will not be available until March. Doctors say that by failing to disclose promptly all their research, Merck and Schering-Plough may be leaving the public with a misleadingly favorable view of Zetia’s safety and benefits. “You don’t want to have data missing,” said Dr. Bruce Psaty, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington. “When there have been adverse effects, when the benefits don’t look impressive, those are the trials that historically don’t make it to press.” A Schering executive, when asked by a reporter about the unpublished studies, confirmed their existence. But the executive, Dr. Robert J. Spiegel, said the companies had not considered the studies scientifically important enough to publish their findings. Some may eventually be published, he said. “We’re pretty comfortable that people don’t have trouble tolerating Zetia,” said Dr. Spiegel, the chief medical officer of the Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, N.J. Schering also said that the F.D.A. had reviewed the data from the unpublished studies and had approved Zetia for use alongside statins. But experts on drug safety say that the agency has been slow to issue warnings about many widely used drugs that have turned out to carry serious risks, including the painkiller Vioxx, the diabetes medicine Avandia and the anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa. Even doctors critical of Zetia generally say it is safe for most patients. But before the drug was approved in 2002, one F.D.A. reviewer said it should not be cleared for use with statins because the combination had caused liver damage in animals. And in the last two years, scattered case reports of severe liver damage in patients taking Zetia in combination with statins have appeared in medical journals. In the United States, the product label for Zetia contains only mild warnings about the drug’s potential for liver damage. But in Australia and Canada, regulators have been more cautious. Since 2005, they have issued a series of warnings about Zetia’s potential to cause hepatitis, pancreatitis and depression  warnings that have largely gone unnoticed in the United States. All drugs have potential risks and side effects, of course, and doctors and patients must weigh those against a drug’s medical benefits. But in the case of Zetia, despite its widespread use, there is no evidence proving that Zetia can reduce heart attacks and strokes, as cholesterol drugs are meant to do. There is extensive medical evidence showing that Lipitor and other statins provide such protection. The unpublished Zetia studies, devised as safety tests, would not prove the drug’s effectiveness. But they would give the public more information about Zetia’s potential risks. All the unpublished studies covered periods at least one year in length and were intended to show whether long-term use of Zetia might pose dangers that short-term use did not. Most of the studies about Zetia in which Merck and Schering have published the results covered periods of only 12 weeks  not enough time for liver problems to develop in most patients. The unpublished studies, conducted from 2000 to 2003 according to the F.D.A. documents, were not listed on the industry Web sites where companies are supposed to register the results of all drug trials that were ongoing after October 2002. The New York Times discovered references to the studies in briefing papers on the F.D.A. Web site. “We keep telling people we want to practice evidence-based medicine, and what we keep finding out is that much of the evidence is obscured,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, when told about the previously undisclosed studies. “There is important evidence, but it’s not in public view. It’s hidden from investigators.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/health/research/18pet.html?ref=merckandcompany">Pet Ferret Hit by an Arrow? Here’s a Book for You<date>Published: December 18, 2007</date><text>Does your gerbil seem depressed? Is its coat rough, its appetite flagging, its posture hunched? Does its exercise wheel stand sadly silent? If so, it might be suffering from Tyzzer’s disease, a bacterial infection commonly seen in gerbils, especially when stressed. Then again, the little rodent might just have a bad case of pinworms. Not knowing which diagnosis applies  or more likely, never having heard of either ailment  is often frustrating for pet owners, who are unsure how serious their animal’s illness is or what to do about it. The new Merck/Merial Manual for Pet Health: Home Edition (Merck &amp; Company, $22.95), an exhaustive guide to the illnesses and care of many of the species that humans, sensibly or not, have turned to for companionship, aims to help out. Mercks manual for humans has long been a resource for doctors, a bible for worried mothers and a draw for hypochondriacs, who can spend hours matching their symptoms to the diseases it describes. In the 1,345 pages of the pet version, readers can find, among other things, the anatomy of a turtle; six signs of hyperparathyroidism in a dog; a list of 27 houseplants poisonous to pets; a description of lockjaw (an infection that leads baby birds to starve to death); instructions for what to do if your pet is shot with an arrow (don’t pull it out); seven causes of liver injuries in horses; the necessary components of a pet travel kit; 161 diseases that can be passed to humans from animals; and yes, a proper diagnosis for a sick gerbil. Those new to pet ownership will discover basic information about choosing pets and how to provide them with a good home. In some cases, they may decide to forgo the pleasure: a sugar glider, for example, while extremely cute, spends its nights barking and chirping and, the book notes, requires at least two hours of human contact per day, lest it develop behavioral problems  like cannibalism. The bulk of the manual, a popular translation of the handbook for veterinarians published by Merck since 1955, is devoted to the three most common household animals: dogs, cats and horses. But the guide also includes chapters on birds and so-called exotic pets, like fish, reptiles, amphibians, chinchillas, ferrets, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, rats, rabbits, prairie dogs, pot-bellied pigs and sugar gliders, as well as sections on emergency care, poisoning, cancer and other subjects. The sheer number of creatures found between the book’s covers is likely to distinguish it from other pet health guides, most of which focus on a single species or even a single breed. And the manual, written by 200 veterinarians, is likely to find an eager readership in an animal-crazed nation, where 68.7 million households include at least one pet and $24.5 billion a year is spent on veterinary care, according to a survey released this month by the American Veterinary Medical Association. “We felt there was a need for a comprehensive book,” said Dr. Scott Line, the manual’s associate editor and an animal behaviorist at Merial, a veterinary drug company co-owned by Merck and Sanofi-Aventis. “People have multiple pets,” Dr. Line said. “Eighty or 85 percent of horse owners also own a dog; half of dog owners have a cat. If you have one book that covers all different species it will make it easier for people.” Still, like The Merck Manual for human health, the pet version often sacrifices depth for breadth. It describes hundreds of diseases, some that readers will find familiar, like diabetes and epilepsy, and many others they are unlikely to recognize, like guttural pouch mycosis (which affects horses) and proliferative enteropathy (recently weaned rabbits). “My feeling is there was a little bit of information on everything and not a lot of information on any one thing,” said Dr. Susan Hackner, head of the department of critical care and emergency medicine at the Animal Medical Center in New York. “It’s like other Merck manuals in that it addresses very briefly and concisely a very comprehensive list of diseases. I think that it’s more of a coffee-table book.” Dr. Hackner noted that some things in the manual were very helpful  for example, the basics of emergency care and the list of household poisons (especially when read before an animal ingests one). There are specific instructions for nursing a sick bird, a discussion of when to euthanize a desperately ill pet and useful descriptions of a variety of medical tests and treatments. Dr. Hackner praised the glossary and the dozens of graphics in the book, singling out a schematic drawing of a cat’s kidney that she said was “really interesting.” But she added that equal space in the manual seemed to be given to very common illnesses  for instance, immune mediated hemolytic anemia, which she said was common in dogs and that the hospital sees a few times a week in summer  and to disorders like hepatozoonosis, a parasitic disease affecting dogs and cats, which the hospital sees rarely, if at all. Some readers may find missing from the guide any mention of commonly used alternative medical treatments, like acupuncture. And those who own exotic animals will almost certainly be better served buying a book dedicated wholly to their species. These lapses, however, are unlikely to deter most pet owners, who can be as obsessive about their animal’s health as they are about their own. And it can’t hurt to know that that strong musty smell is coming from your unneutered ferret, that a chunk of avocado could kill your cockatiel and that you should never, ever pick up a gerbil by its tail.
