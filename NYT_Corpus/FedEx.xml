The delivery giant is no longer competing for deliveries inside United States borders, but it still jostles for public awareness with its rivals UPS, FedEx and, to an extent, the Postal Service — each of which also in recent weeks began advertising campaigns highlighting their acumen in mail and express delivery. DHL has been less visible in the United States after eliminating thousands of jobs at its Ohio air hub and other locations in 2008 to offset a drop in deliveries of mortgage documents, contracts and other time-sensitive material. But now it is renewing its American presence with its “international specialist” campaign to emphasize its ability to handle customs clearance and other aspects of overseas shipping, said Christine Nashick, vice president for marketing for DHL Express U.S. An American presence is important to DHL because 40 percent of its largest 350 global business clients are based in the United States. The new campaign, she said, aims to expand that customer base with small- and medium-size companies that have 500 or fewer employees and are shipping abroad.  The ads begin with a DHL van dissolving into a streak of yellow light that speeds around the globe then lights up the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks. The ad is set to a remixed soundtrack of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” the Motown classic that DHL also used in a commercial two decades ago. “This is a contemporary spin on that earlier effort,” said Joseph Siegel , director of advertising, brand and communication at DHL Express U.S. “The company started as an international shipper in the U.S., so you could say we’re going back to our roots.” The campaign, created with 180 Amsterdam, which is owned by the Omnicom Group, includes print ads in major business magazines like “Entrepreneur,” and Web ads on Yahoo.com and other news sites. Also, 30-second spots will be shown on the CNN network in 45 airports around the country, as well as on television channels including the BBC. The print and digital ads touch on fashion, auto, high tech and health care, including one showing a model in a glowing dress that says: “A dress is stitched in Paris. The next night it’s applauded in New York.” Another ad says: “A contract is signed in London. By 10:30 a.m. the next day it touches down on Wall Street.” Each ends with: “That’s the speed of yellow. DHL Express. Excellence. Simply Delivered.” The campaign is appearing in 19 American markets and 42 global markets. DHL did not disclose its advertising budget, but Ms. Nashick said that about 50 percent of its spending was in digital and about 20 percent in print. “Digital is more fun, and we can interact with our customers,” she said. “We are also showing in airports and other travel locations because that’s a more effective spend.” Last year, DHL spent about $8 million on advertising in the United States market, according to Kantar Media, a WPP unit. The DHL spending will increase this year, Ms. Nashick said, but over all, it is a blip compared with ad spending by its rivals. Last year, FedEx spent about $121 million and UPS approximately $109 million, according to Kantar. UPS, for example, is reprising its “We (heart) logistics” campaign, which it began last year, to promote its role as the official logistics provider for the London 2012 Olympic Games. The campaign, created with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a WPP holding, describes the UPS role in delivering one million pieces of sports equipment, among other items, to England next summer. The campaign is largely digital, mobile and social, said Betsy Wilson, the company’s director of global advertising. FedEx introduced its new campaign last month, with the theme, “Solutions that matter,” to describe the range of FedEx answers for customers’ shipping needs. The campaign, with BBDO New York, part of the BBDO North America unit of BBDO Worldwide (owned by the Omnicom Group), includes digital, social media and movie theater commercials in addition to television spots. The campaign covers health care, auto parts shipping and the company’s environmental awareness, including more electric trucks and more efficient air planes.  While the air express giants vie to gain market share, the beleaguered Postal Service is rolling out a new television ad campaign highlighting the value of first-class mail. The post office, which spent $145 million last year on advertising, also delivers packages via its express and priority services, but its share of the air delivery market is only about 3 percent, according to the Air Cargo Management Group, an aviation consulting firm based in Seattle. In addition to the United States market, DHL is directing a significant part of its international specialists campaign to the $80 million global delivery business by having the campaign translated into 25 languages, and appearing on 280 television stations and in 360 print publications around the world. In contrast to the American market, “international lanes are growing in the high single digits,” said Peter Nesvold, who analyzes the express delivery industry for Jefferies &amp; Company, “and that’s where the money is being made.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/business/fedex-cuts-its-profit-outlook.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Citing Weak Global Growth, FedEx Cuts Its Profit Outlook<date>Published: September 22, 2011</date><text>FedEx cut its full-year profit outlook on Thursday, citing fuel prices and weak global economic growth, sending its shares down 8 percent.Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive, said he did not expect economic conditions to improve much any time soon, although he did not expect the United States to dip back into recession. “We expect sluggish economic growth will continue, largely due to a lack of confidence that U.S. and European policy makers will effectively address current economic challenges,” Mr. Smith said in a conference call to discuss quarterly results. With inventories low, FedEx expects to benefit if there is an uptick in demand in the run-up to the holiday shopping season and retailers need fast delivery. Much is also riding on robust online orders. But for now, things remain subdued. The sheer volume of goods moved by FedEx makes its shipment trends a bellwether for consumer demand and economic growth. The value of packages handled by FedEx’s trucks and planes every year is equivalent to about 4 percent of United States gross domestic product and 1.5 percent of global G.D.P. The company so far has had little resistance to rate increases, the latest of which went into effect this month. FedEx reiterated its $4.2 billion capital expenditure plan for the year ending next May. The company is considering buying about 50 wide-body freighters from Boeing and Airbus to update its fleet to more fuel-efficient models. FedEx said fiscal first-quarter profit, which slightly beat forecasts, rose to $464 million, or $1.46 a share, from $380 million, or $1.20 a share, in the period a year ago. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.45 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The company cut its forecast for earnings for the year to May 2012 to $6.25 to $6.75 a share from its June estimate of $6.35 to $6.85. Revenue rose 11 percent, to $10.52 billion, from $9.46 billion a year earlier. That was above the average forecast of $10.32 billion. Shares of FedEx fell $5.92, or 8.2 percent, to $66.58.. With the stock down about 30 percent this year, FedEx said it planned to buy back 5.7 million shares under its existing repurchase authorization.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/business/media/fedex-to-introduce-new-campaign.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx to Introduce New Campaign - Advertising<date>Published: September 7, 2011</date><text>IF professional football did not exist, Madison Avenue would probably try to invent it. The sport delivers large audiences for the important fall and Christmas shopping seasons. Those audiences almost all watch the games live, meaning there is no fast-forwarding through commercials during DVR playbacks. And each season culminates with a mid-winter event during which viewers are known to focus on the ads as much as the action.So this year’s lengthy lockout, which raised speculation that there would be no 2011-12 National Football League season, filled marketers and agencies with dread. The settlement that meant the season would start on time brought loud sighs of relief, along with a rush by N.F.L. sponsors to put the finishing touches on big new advertising efforts. A notable example is FedEx, which will introduce a campaign during the first game of the season, between the Green Bay Packers and the New Orleans Saints, which will be broadcast by NBC on Thursday. The campaign presents a new theme, “Solutions that matter,” which replaces a theme, “We understand,” that was introduced in 2009. “We were sweating” the potential for a delay or disruption, said Steve Pacheco, director for advertising at FedEx in Memphis. With the potential of disruption in the past, he added, FedEx put together “an aggressive plan to launch the campaign.” In addition to the television commercials, elements of the campaign include ads online as well as commercials in movie theaters and on the FedEx channel on YouTube, at youtube.com/FedEx. Also, a section of the FedEx Web site will be devoted to the campaign, at fedex.com/solutionsthatmatter.  Although the previous theme “performed well,” Mr. Pacheco said, “we needed to do a better job telling all the cool things we do to help solve people’s problems,” whether it is delivering precious cargo, printing documents or shipping golf clubs. “We’re too young to have an identity crisis,” he said of FedEx, which began express package deliveries in 1973, “but we want to make sure people know all the roles we play.” The first four commercials in the campaign use humor to try to achieve that goal. One spot borrows Hollywood techniques, including special effects and dramatic music, to tell how FedEx can deliver a heart valve from Australia “in time for an operation” in Los Angeles. A second spot is devoted to explaining to the owner of an auto repair shop, who is looking for “an edge,” how FedEx can ship parts “from factories around the world” and “clear them through customs.” A third commercial describes how the services available at FedEx Office stores can even help an entrepreneur who is hidden in the witness protection program. And in a fourth commercial, a FedEx employee delivers packages to a company that is trying to be “more environmentally aware.” When he is unexpectedly asked to talk about FedEx’s green steps, he mentions “more electric trucks and lower-emission planes” as well as reusable envelopes. The campaign is being produced by the longtime creative agency for FedEx, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO North America unit of BBDO Worldwide, which is owned by the Omnicom Group. “Once you change people’s perspectives of what FedEx can do, they can connect the dots fairly quickly,” said Mike Smith, executive creative director at BBDO New York. Mr. Pacheco described the budget for the campaign as “healthy,” adding with a laugh, “We’ve saved up our nickels and dimes.” According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, FedEx spent $10.6 million to advertise in major media in the first quarter compared with $29.7 million in the same period of 2010. Ad spending by FedEx totaled $121.1 million last year, Kantar Media reported, up from $103.4 million in 2009 and $117.1 million in 2008, but down from $162.1 million in 2007.  Another sign of the ardor among advertisers for the N.F.L. is the strong demand for commercial time in Super Bowl XLVI, to be broadcast by NBC on Feb. 5, 2012. Of the estimated 63 30-second commercial slots during the game, all but five or six are already sold, at prices estimated to be as much as $3.5 million apiece. Among those already identified as Super Bowl sponsors are Anheuser-Busch InBev, Century 21, Chevrolet, GoDaddy, Mercedes-Benz and Pepsi-Cola. FedEx had been a regular Super Bowl advertiser but skipped the game in 2009, 2010 and 2011. “Officially, we don’t know yet” whether the company will return to the Super Bowl next year, Mr. Pacheco said. “The decision will be made very soon.” Perhaps tipping his hand, he added, “I do believe there’ll be other opportunities, maybe outside the Super Bowl, for big impact” for the campaign. The new football season will also usher in the annual spate of ads with popular N.F.L. players as the stars. Among them will be a campaign for the Ugg line of men’s shoes and boots sold by the Deckers Outdoor Corporation, featuring Tom Brady of the New England Patriots. A commercial created by the Los Angeles office of M&amp;C Saatchi, in which Mr. Brady wears Ugg footwear, is to run on Monday on ESPN during the first “Monday Night Football” game of the season. The spot is also appearing online on Web sites that include uggaustralia.com. The campaign includes national print and outdoor ads created by House Design and Film in Los Angeles.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://onpar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/lightning-halts-play-at-barclays/?ref=fedexcorporation">Play to Resume at the Barclays<date>August 25, 2011, 11:41 am</date><text>EDISON, N.J. — Play is set to resume at the Barclays, the first event of the PGA tour’s FedEx Cup playoffs, at 1:45 p.m. after a more than three-hour delay because of lightning in the area. Play was suspended at 10:29 a.m. No player has completed more than 13 holes. The afternoon groups, which were supposed to begin teeing off at noon, will now begin at 2:45 p.m. The last afternoon group will now tee off at 4:35 p.m. The marquee threesome of Luke Donald, Keegan Bradley, and Phil Mickelson is set to tee off at 3:51 p.m. from the first tee. Play began off the first and 10th tees at Plainfield Country Club at 7:15 a.m. In anticipation of inclement weather, Tour officials decided before the round began to play preferred lies (also known as lift, clean and place) in closely mowed areas cut to fairway height or less. The co-leaders when play was suspended were J.J. Henry and Adam Scott at five under par. Both began their rounds on No. 10. Henry ran off six consecutive birdies from the 15th hole through the second before making a bogey on the par-3 third. Scott has made only one par, but offset two bogeys with five birdies and an eagle on the par-5 16th to shoot 31 for his first nine holes. Henry and Scott have a one-stroke lead over Harrison Frazar, who shot a four-under 31 on the front nine, then parred 10 and 11. Thunderstorms are in the forecast for early Thursday afternoon. Tour officials are not sure when play will be able to resume.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/fuel-economy-its-not-just-for-cars-anymore/?ref=fedexcorporation">Fuel Economy: It's Not Just for Cars Anymore<date>August 9, 2011, 5:26 pm</date><text>Associated Press The Obama administration issued fuel economy standards on Tuesday for medium and heavy trucks, the first time the government has regulated vehicles over 8,500 pounds. The vehicles in this category range from the very largest S.U.V.’s, and pickup trucks that are too big to be household vehicles, all the way to 18-wheelers, which have a maximum loaded weight of 80,000 pounds. But in one sense the economics are the same for a 4,000-pound car or a truck weighing 20 times that much: better fuel economy usually means paying more for the new vehicle but also saving money at the pump. One argument for government fuel economy standards is that car buyers almost always focus on the purchase price as opposed to the total cost, including the operating cost. Yet medium and heavy trucks are mostly owned by companies, which often have accountants, engineers and other professionals who can compare the value of a gallon of fuel saved against the higher price for a more efficient engine and make the right decision. (Fuel-efficient models already exist.) The government says that the extra costs are paid back in a year or two. So why do fleet buyers, who are perfectly capable of making such calculations, need government standards to help tell them how to make the best buy? Advocates give several reasons. One is that at the lower end of the weight scale, many of the vehicles are owned by very small businesses or individuals. “They may not have the staff of number crunchers that FedEx does,’’ said Zoe Lipman, the senior manager of transportation solutions at the National Wildlife Federation. The other is that a lot of the big trucks are operated by small companies. According to the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which says it has 115,000 members, “nearly 96 percent of registered motor carriers in the U.S. operate 20 or fewer trucks.’’ The association opposed the new rule. It argued that it would drive up costs for small businesses and that the government should have focused on training drivers to use less fuel. In fact, many of the small companies buy used trucks. Eventually the most efficient trucks in the rule published on Tuesday — the ones in the 2018 model year — will be old and will end up in the hands of companies that buy them used. But the association said that higher prices for trucks would encourage companies to keep their older ones longer. That would have negative implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as well as fuel economy. The medium trucks will use a lot of the technologies that cars do already — hybridization, for example, especially for urban delivery vehicles. Over-the-road trucks could undergo some bigger changes. Allen R. Schaeffer, the director of the Diesel Technology Forum, a trade group, predicted that some big trucks would begin carrying a tiny extra engine called an auxiliary power unit that could run the air-conditioning in the cabin while the truck was parked. The main engine uses a half a gallon or more of fuel for each hour of idling, he said. Big trucks might also get more sophisticated fuel injection systems, and electric motors to run the power steering. Trucks do little steering on the highway, but a conventional power steering system pulls energy continuously from the engine through a drive belt.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/business/23fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Profit Rises 33%, Exceeding Forecasts<date>Published: June 22, 2011</date><text>The FedEx Corporation’s quarterly profit and outlook beat forecasts on Wednesday as higher shipping rates and tight cost controls more than offset a slowing economic recovery and high fuel prices.The company said it would spend more on technology and fuel-efficient aircraft, helping to increase revenue per package. “Our actions to improve yields continue to drive revenue and earnings growth across our transportation segments,” FedEx’s chief financial officer, Alan B. Graf Jr., said. “Even with higher planned capital spending in fiscal 2012, margins, cash flows and returns are expected to improve year over year.” FedEx, which ranks No. 2 behind United Parcel Service among package shipping companies, has been able to pass through higher costs via fuel surcharges and still has room to raise prices without widespread retaliation from consumers, many analysts said. “Pricing and expense control” drove FedEx earnings up even as it navigated harsh weather, an economic soft patch and supply chain disruptions caused by Japan’s earthquake, and lofty fuel costs, said Peter Nesvold, a Jefferies &amp; Company analyst. FedEx’s chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said the combination of rising fuel prices, the devastation in Japan and consumer sentiment contributed to the slowing of the economic recovery. However, he said he expected a turnaround now that crude oil prices were retreating. FedEx predicted that consumer spending, industrial production and gross domestic product would improve in the second half of 2011. FedEx said its profit rose 33 percent, to $558 million, or $1.75 a share, from $419 million, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, forecast a profit of $1.72 a share. FedEx forecast its fiscal 2012 profit rising to $6.35 to $6.85 a share, allowing for oil’s volatility, Mr. Graf said. The midpoint of $6.60 topped analyst forecasts. Revenue in the period, which ended May 31 and was the fourth quarter of FedEx’s fiscal year, rose 12 percent, to $10.55 billion from $9.43 billion. FedEx Express and the less expensive ground segments, which account for more than 80 percent of the company’s revenue, had revenue growth of more than 10 percent in the quarter. Fast-growing e-commerce drove up FedEx’s SmartPost average daily volume 24 percent as revenue per package rose 8 percent. SmartPost involves shipping packages to the United States Postal Service, which in turn delivers to residences. FedEx’s freight division posted a long-awaited return to profitability after two company segments were combined. Stock in FedEx, which is based in Memphis, rose $2.31, or 2.6 percent, to $91.44 a share.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/obama-pushes-energy-savings-from-clean-fleets/?ref=fedexcorporation">Obama Pushes Energy Savings From 'Clean Fleets'<date>April 1, 2011, 10:41 am</date><text>President Obama is joining with FedEx, U.P.S. and several other major companies whose vehicles are familiar sights on America’s roadways to promote a new administration initiative encouraging businesses to operate commercial fleets that burn less gasoline and diesel fuel. Two days after Mr. Obama set a national goal of cutting oil imports by one-third by 2025, in a speech at Georgetown University, he was scheduled to travel on Friday to a shipping center in Landover, Md., just outside Washington, to view new “clean fleets” belonging to the two delivery giants and to AT&amp;T, PepsiCo and Verizon. The president’s focus on clean energy this week comes at a time when Americans are paying gasoline prices that now average about $4 a gallon, close to the high levels just before he won election in 2008. According to the White House, the five corporations have commercial fleets that are among the 10 largest in the country; together they own more than 275,000 cars and trucks. They have joined the administration’s new public-private partnership to encourage a switch to vehicles that are more fuel-efficient or run on electric power or alternative fuels. In the near term, the five companies will deploy more than 20,000 advanced-technology vehicles, saving more than 7 million gallons of oil, the administration estimated. The National Clean Fleets Partnership would be open to companies of all sizes, according to the White House. Through the Department of Energy, which already has a Clean Cities vehicle technology program, participants would get up-to-date technical information and purchasing assistance. For example, smaller companies could piggy-back on larger corporations’ bulk purchases, enjoying the same cost savings on advanced vehicles that use electric batteries, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen or propane.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/business/18fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Optimistic for Turnaround in Quarter<date>Published: March 17, 2011</date><text>FedEx said Thursday its profit fell 3 percent in its most recent quarter, as rising fuel prices and harsh winter weather offset an 11 percent increase in revenue.But the company said revenue should continue to improve and its freight unit should return to profitability in the fourth quarter. The company earned $231 million or 73 cents a share in the quarter, down from $239 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Winter storms reduced net income by about 12 cents a share. Fuel prices went up 30 percent from a year ago. Maintenance costs rose 19 percent as the company flew more aircraft. Revenue in the period, which ended Feb. 28 and was the third quarter of FedEx’s fiscal year, rose 11 percent to $9.66 billion, mostly because of higher prices and heavier packages. For the current quarter, the company is predicting a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share. Analysts currently predict $1.66. Despite the strong forecast, FedEx warned that political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa could hurt earnings. The full impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is unclear, but property damage was minimal, FedEx said. Stock in FedEx, which is based in Memphis, rose $2.61, to $87.89 a share. In the third quarter, Express unit revenue rose 11 percent from a year earlier. Ground segment revenue improved the most of any unit, at 14 percent.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/business/15fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Cuts Forecast, Citing Fuel Costs and Weather<date>Published: February 14, 2011</date><text>FedEx on Monday sharply cut its quarterly profit forecast, citing higher fuel costs and severe winter weather that disrupted delivery operations in the United States and Europe.The delivery company now expects an adjusted profit of 70 to 90 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ends Feb. 28. That is down from its earlier forecast for a profit of 95 cents to $1.15 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect FedEx to post a profit of $1.06 a share, on average. The company’s updated forecast assumes no further weather disruptions and stable fuel prices for the rest of the quarter. FedEx, based in Memphis, said those factors would also affect its full-year forecast, to be updated when the company reports third-quarter numbers on March 17. FedEx has faced unusually high costs from winter storms, said Alan B. Graf Jr., its chief financial officer. Parts of the Northeast and Midwest have been hit by unusually heavy snow this winter, disrupting airport operations and ground travel. Ice and snow have hit areas as far south as Georgia and Texas. Mr. Graf also said that fuel costs continued to rise since the company provided a financial forecast in mid-December. Jet fuel prices are up about 13 percent since then. However, Mr. Graf said FedEx continued to experience strength in its business across all transportation segments and geographic regions. The company and its larger rival, United Parcel Service, are bellwethers of global economic health because they ship a variety of goods. In its previous quarter, which ended in November, FedEx reported net income of $283 million, or 89 cents a share, down 18 percent from the same quarter a year earlier. The company said higher fuel costs were among the factors that hurt results.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/business/17fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Reports a Weak Second Quarter<date>Published: December 16, 2010</date><text>The FedEx Corporation raised its fiscal full-year outlook on record holiday shipments, sending shares higher even after its second-quarter profit missed Wall Street expectations.“We’re now more bullish about the remainder of the year based on our record-setting peak volumes and greater anticipated customer demand for our services,” the company’s chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said Thursday in a conference call. “We believe consumer and business sentiments are improving.” Higher compensation costs cut into profit in the second quarter, while international volume lagged behind the company’s expectations and fuel surcharges did not keep pace with rising costs, FedEx said. “Raising guidance in the face of these headwinds, capturing market share and continuing to make inroads overseas are all positive,” said Alan Lancz, president of the wealth management firm Alan B. Lancz Inc. in Toledo, Ohio, who owns FedEx shares. The company’s bright outlook trumps the profit miss, he said. Momentum from holiday shipping is moderating, but high. The company expects that its business in Asia and growth from emerging markets should increase profit margins in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. The 223 million peak holiday season shipments that the company expects worldwide would be up 11 percent from a year ago, driven by online and catalog retailers. Books, clothing, consumer electronics and luxury goods account for the volume this year. FedEx raised its full-year forecast to $5 to $5.30 a share from its previous estimate of $4.80 to $5.25. Its shares rose $1.83, or 2 percent, to $94.22. The company’s fiscal second-quarter net profit was $283 million, or 89 cents a share, compared with $345 million, or $1.10 a share, in the period a year earlier.

Smith, chairman and chief executive of FedEx, doesn’t publicize his own giving much, but enthusiastically supports his company’s efforts, which he said in an interview pay dividends in many ways.Q. What is your company’s strategic approach to giving? A. We know from a lot of research and communications with customers and various demographic groups, that it’s good business to be a good corporate citizen. People absolutely make business decisions toward companies that have good corporate responsibility records. The second thing is that from a human perspective, it’s important that we do it because we have the capability to do it uniquely. Our expertise is logistics and contingencies; we deal with it every day. We have 700 airplanes, 85,000 trucks, and it allows us to provide logistics support to people in need in these disasters that aren’t matched by anyone else. We’re 60 percent larger than the next largest company. When something happens, it affects us. We have the ability to help people. The third thing is, our team of 300,000 folks are highly motivated when people need assistance. It makes customers feel better about the company. Keeping our “purple promise” is a big part of the service business. Q. Shareholders have demanded that companies justify their corporate giving. Is that still true? A. The evolution of thought about this has gone from the only purpose of a business is to create a return for shareholders to a broader responsibility to shareholders, communities, suppliers. That debate has not been resolved, but we know from our customer research and loyalty research that being a responsible corporate citizen, especially to younger cohorts, is enormously important. When someone is standing on a rooftop in New Orleans or marooned in China, it’s hard to stand by, especially when you have the capability to help them out. Q. Your company gives a lot of in-kind relief to countries where you are trying to expand your business. Is that deliberate? A. We know that it is directly related to people’s willingness to buy. So it’s good business. The amount of money is significant, but in terms in the company, it’s modest. We’re approaching $40 billion in revenue. Because of our scope and scale, it’s something we can do. Q. What has been the impact of the decline in government spending? A. First and foremost, people who run public companies have a fiduciary responsibility to manage their money. So there’s an upper limit to that based on their primary legal responsibilities. Do I think the corporate giving will pick up the slack of the lack of government benefits or deal with unemployment? To some degree, but on the margins. We have increased our giving, but the best way to deal with the recession is to keep growing as a company. Q. How has your corporate giving evolved? A. Initially, when something happens, our folks would say, ‘Can’t we do something to help these people?’ As we got bigger and bigger, and our capabilities became enormous, it was obvious we needed to formalize it. The most important thing that happened was the relationships with these various organizations that are in the business of helping these people. They provide that decades-old understanding, and we can provide the logistics support and financial support. Q. Some say corporate giving is not philanthropy. Is the distinction necessary? A. Giving of this sort is different from the disaster relief we do. With a few exceptions, there are few who can do what we do. The U.S. military can be included in that. Normally with corporate giving, our criteria for that is pretty clear. It has to be something that supports our business objectives or tends to further the goals of the corporation. We don’t have a foundation. It could be to a particular university that has a corporate education program, or something to do with the quality of the health of our employees in a certain place. We do it, but we just don’t throw money around for the sake of it. Q. How do you measure success in your giving? A. The way we finally answered it was to recognize that there were people who were much more expert in measuring than we are, those groups like the Red Cross, Heart to Heart, the Salvation Army. If the Red Cross says we need X amount of pounds of medical supplies or tents, we’re relying on their people on the ground with the expertise. We preposition things for the American Red Cross. We have helped to look after United Way trucks, but they need to decide how many cups of coffee, bandages and so on. Q. Your company spends about 1.5 percent of its pretax profits on giving, higher than the 0.9 percent average for companies. Do you expect that percentage to rise? A. We budget every year for in-kind giving and flying in disaster relief. We sort of set a target and budget and work backward from there. But we would, on an ad hoc basis, adjust it, like in 2005 after Katrina. Q. What are some of the latest trends in corporate giving? A. The biggest trends we see is team member engagement. One of the things we have is FedEx Cares. We assist our folks to assist other people. They volunteer a lot of hours. That’s an increasingly important part of corporate social responsibility. We’ve been doing it a long time. I don’t think it’s recession related. It’s the normal idea of feeling good. For example, in a tough neighborhood in the United States, we have a facility in those neighborhoods, so we can assemble to do anything that needs to be done. That’s a modest part of our corporate philanthropy, but it’s increasingly something that our employees do. Q. Some say that helping send relief supplies is a Band-Aid, and that companies should help alleviate the underlying problems, like global warming, that might cause hurricanes or other disasters. How do you respond? A. We have very rigorous goals to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels. This year, we have a $3.5 billion capital budget for new 777 planes, which are much more efficient, and 757s that are replacing 727s. We’ve played a leadership role in the electrification program and electric vehicles that are recharged at night when they are not being used. We have a goal to reduce our carbon footprint by 20 percent by 2020 in our vehicle fleet. We have large solar power installations at an airport in Cologne and in Woodbridge, N.J., and use all sorts of recycled materials. We’re doing all of those things for good business reasons as well as the broader interest.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11FEDEX.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx and Airlines Airlift Aid to Disaster Areas<date>Published: November 10, 2010</date><text>WAYNE YANKOVICH was at his home in Indianapolis on his day off when he heard that an earthquake had just struck Haiti. His wife, Louise, was downstairs watching CNN and immediately relayed the news.Mr. Yankovich, who works as a loadmaster in FedEx’s charter division, knew he might be asked to fly soon. So he called his boss, Walter Hooker, at the company’s headquarters in Memphis and volunteered for any relief missions. Within a few hours, he was told to get to Miami in 48 hours to meet an MD-11 airliner arriving from Denver that was filled with relief supplies collected by World Vision, a Christian group dedicated to eradicating poverty. Because the airport in Port-au-Prince could not handle so large a plane, the airliner crew flew to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, from where the supplies would be trucked into Haiti. The crew then flew to Panama to pick up another load of supplies at an American Red Cross warehouse and brought it back to Santo Domingo. The relief mission was one of hundreds that FedEx, U.P.S., D.H.L. and other carriers and airlines fly every year. The airlines pick up supplies around the United States, and from countries like Denmark and Dubai, and carry them to places as diverse as Haiti, Chile, Pakistan and the Gulf Coast. In most cases, the airlines transport the supplies free, part of a growing pool of in-kind donations they make each year. Each year, FedEx sets aside space for as much as four million pounds of charitable shipping. Last year, the airline helped 172 organizations ship 107 tons of relief goods. Jumping on a plane for a whirlwind trip to three countries was nothing new for Mr. Yankovich. But the mission this time was more meaningful. “It sure is different because you know you’re doing something good, and you know that the items you’re bringing in are going to be used for a different purpose, to help human beings,” said Mr. Yankovich, who has worked at FedEx for 22 years. “At the end of the day, you come back and say, ‘I really think I’ve helped someone.’ ” This year, FedEx has donated more than $1.9 million in cash and in-kind transportation for relief and recovery in Haiti, moving more than 1.5 million pounds of supplies. After the earthquake in Sichuan, China, in 2008, FedEx delivered $1.5 million worth of relief supplies from Heart to Heart, a development organization. The airline shipped two million pounds of relief products to the Gulf Coast during the 2005 hurricane season. In all, charitable giving (including cash and in-kind donations) came to 1.5 percent of pretax profits last fiscal year, excluding one-time charges, up from 1.1 percent in fiscal year 2008. On average, American corporations donate 0.9 percent of their pretax profits. The growing in-kind giving by airlines and other companies helped offset a 3.6 percent decline in overall giving in 2009, according to GivingUSA, which tracks philanthropy. In the last three years, U.P.S. has shipped hundreds of tons of relief supplies to Myanmar, China, Zimbabwe and Haiti, as well as to states affected by flooding and hurricanes. To Haiti, U.P.S. delivered more then three million pounds of materials, including water, water purification systems, medical supplies, generators and tents. American Airlines made more than $34 million in in-kind donations to nonprofit groups in 2009. After the earthquake in Haiti, American and American Eagle flew in 400,000 pounds of aid and evacuated more than 700 people on 30 humanitarian flights. American Airlines, which has been in Haiti for about 40 years, also helped rebuild Toussaint L’Ouverture International Airport, which had been recertified by the F.A.A. American also converted its cargo terminal into an international arrivals building. “This is getting into the fiber of the country and picking it up with your hands,” said Art Torno, who ran the Caribbean region for American Airlines when the earthquake hit. “We’re not just an airline, but an economic engine that powers cargo and people.” In years past, relief efforts were organized ad hoc. After disaster struck, charities would call the airlines asking them to carry supplies to those in need. It could take days to sort out whether the relief supplies were needed in the disaster zone and getting the supplies to the airport and distributed. But shipping relief supplies from Point A to Point B has become far more orderly, with entire staffs working with charities, finding planes and crews to transport the supplies and ensuring that the right goods get to those who need them most. FedEx has perhaps the most extensive system for accepting and shipping relief supplies. To reduce confusion, the carrier has selected five primary charities — the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Water Missions, Direct Relief and Heart to Heart International. “It’s better to figure out what FedEx is doing rather than recreate the wheel,” said Brett Williams, the director of disaster response at Direct Relief International. “FedEx pushes us to think bigger because they operate on a global scale.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E5DB1438F93BA35752C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=fedexcorporation">CITY ROOM; To Avoid Tickets, One Delivery Driver Pleads for Pity<date>Published: November 8, 2010</date><text>It is an old strategy among parcel delivery drivers in New York City: Leave a parking summons tucked on your windshield and hope the ticket agent walks right past your illegally parked truck, believing it has already been ticketed. ''That trick never works,'' said John P. Lopez, a FedEx deliveryman with a route in West Harlem. ''Everyone knows it. The agents walk right up, read the old ticket you got earlier at some other location, and they write a new one. Now you got two.'' So Mr. Lopez came up with a different approach: a plea for sympathy. ''Some of these ticket-writers see my truck and think FedEx pays all the parking tickets - they were ticketing me like crazy,'' he said on a recent day while unloading packages from his truck on West 114th Street in Manhattan. Well, doesn't FedEx pay the tickets? ''No, sometimes we have to pay our own tickets,'' said Mr. Lopez, who has been driving for the company for eight years. ''Fire hydrants, bus stops, blocking traffic lanes - we got to pay them ourselves.'' So a few weeks back, Mr. Lopez tore himself a fresh piece of packaging paper and wrote out a plea to traffic agents who might not be aware of what he called FedEx policy to leave drivers responsible for certain egregious instances of illegal parking. The sign reads: ''Fedex doesn't pay for our tickets, we pay for our tickets, so please be considerate!'' ''I'm telling you, the sign works,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''Most of the ticket agents are cool, and respect that we're out here making a living. They might not have much sympathy for some big corporation, but if they know we're paying our own tickets, some of them cut us a little slack. Other drivers I know have copied my sign.'' Mr. Lopez also asked on the sign for dispensation double-parking violations. These often seem to be more of a judgment call, as to whether a driver has truly parked in a traffic lane and left the truck for long stretches, or simply halted very briefly to run a package into a store or building, he said. A FedEx spokeswoman said that the company paid all parking tickets for vehicles assigned to its FedEx Express air-courier service, but that many FedEx trucks in New York City are part of its FedEx ground division, which contracts with private companies to deliver its packages. Those contractors set their own parking summons policies with employees. As for Mr. Lopez's claim that some parking agents go easier on a poor working stiff than on a big corporation, a police spokesman declined to comment. A U.P.S. driver delivering packages recently from a double-parked truck on West 108th Street said his company covered just about every ticket incurred by its drivers, and that he got about five tickets per day on his route in Morningside Heights. ''The company tells us not to park in front of hydrants and bus stops, but they only make drivers pay if they keep getting ticket after ticket,'' said the driver, who would not give his name. As for Mr. Lopez, he said he regularly used his days off to contest the tickets at the parking violations bureau. ''A lot of them get dismissed,'' he said. ''I wind up only paying one a month myself, maybe less.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/world/31terror.html?ref=fedexcorporation">U.S. Sees Complexity of Bombs as Link to Al Qaeda<date>Published: October 30, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The powerful bombs concealed inside cargo packages and destined for the United States were expertly constructed and unusually sophisticated, American officials said Saturday, further evidence that Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen is steadily improving its abilities to strike on American soil.As investigators on three continents conducted forensic analyses of two bombs shipped from Yemen and intercepted Friday in Britain and Dubai, American officials said evidence was mounting that the top leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including the radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was behind the attempted attacks. Yemeni officials on Saturday announced the arrest of a young woman and her mother in connection with the plot, which also may have involved two language schools in Yemen. The two women were not identified, but a defense lawyer who has been in contact with the family, Abdul Rahman Barham, said the daughter was a 22 year-old engineering student at Sana University. Yemen’s president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said Saturday night during a news conference that Yemeni security forces had identified her based on a tip from American officials, but he did not indicate her suspected role. Investigators said that the bomb discovered at the Dubai airport in the United Arab Emirates was concealed in a Hewlett-Packard desktop printer, with high explosives packed into a printer cartridge to avoid detection by scanners. “The wiring of the device indicates that this was done by professionals,” said one official involved in the investigation, who like several officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing. “It was set up so that if you scan it, all the printer components would look right.” The bomb discovered in Britain was also hidden in a printer cartridge. The terror plot broke publicly in dramatic fashion on Friday morning, when the two packages containing explosives and addressed to synagogues or Jewish community centers in Chicago were found, setting off an international dragnet and fears about packages yet to be discovered. It also led to a tense scene in which American military jets escorted a plane to Kennedy International Airport amid concerns — which turned out to be unfounded — that there might be explosives on board. On Saturday, in news conferences in London and Yemen, and from interviews with investigators here and abroad, the contours of the investigation began to emerge, along with new details of the frantic hours leading to the discovery of the packages. American officials said their operating assumption was that the two bombs were the work of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, Al Qaeda in Yemen’s top bomb-maker, whose previous devices have been more rudimentary, and also unsuccessful. Mr. Asiri is believed to have built both the bomb sewn into the underwear of the young Nigerian who tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight last Dec. 25, and the suicide bomb that nearly killed Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief, Mohammed bin Nayef, months earlier. (In the second episode, American officials say, Mr. Asiri hid the explosives in a body cavity of his brother, the suicide bomber.) Just as in the two previous attacks, the bomb discovered in Dubai contained the explosive PETN, according to the Dubai police and Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security. This new plot, Ms. Napolitano said, had the “hallmarks of Al Qaeda.” The targets of the bombs remained in question. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said on Saturday that the parcel bomb intercepted in England was designed to explode while the plane was flying. The country’s home secretary, Theresa May, said that British investigators had also concluded the device was “viable and could have exploded.” “The target may have been an aircraft, and had it detonated, the aircraft could have been brought down,” she said. But earlier in the day, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House homeland security intelligence subcommittee, said that federal authorities indicated to him that the packages were probably intended to blow up the Jewish sites in Chicago rather than the cargo planes, since they do not carry passengers. Based on a conversation with Ms. Napolitano, he said that authorities were also leaving open the possibility that other packages with explosives had not yet been found. On Saturday, Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department’s chief spokesman, said that no specific threats had been made against synagogues or Jewish neighborhoods in the city, but that officers were watching them more closely as a precaution. It was a call from Mr. bin Nayef, the Saudi intelligence chief, on Thursday evening to John O. Brennan, the White House senior counterterrorism official and former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that set off the search, according to American officials. They said Mr. bin Nayef also notified C.I.A. officials in Riyadh.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/us/30cargo.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Explosives in Cargo Renew Debate on Screening<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>The discovery of two explosive devices shipped by cargo planes has reignited a long-running debate about how thoroughly cargo needs to be screened on its way into the United States.Despite the increased scrutiny of people and luggage on passenger planes since 9/11, there are far fewer safeguards for packages and bundles, particularly when loaded on cargo-only planes. The issue has come up in Congress repeatedly and was the subject of a recent report by the research arm of Congress that warned new mandates were not being met. Industry experts said the latest case suggested that terrorists may have singled out cargo aircraft precisely because they are not subject to the same scrutiny as passenger planes. Only a small percentage of all cargo from abroad is physically checked on freight planes bound for the United States. A law that took effect in August requiring full screening does not apply. “The 100 percent screening requirements only pertains to passenger flights that carry air cargo,” said Steve Lord, a director of homeland security and justice issues at the Government Accountability Office. The size of a package can determine whether it is physically checked. A legislative aide who has studied the issue said large packages were subject to a higher level of scrutiny, usually meaning they are opened, in an effort partly meant to detect stowaways. If a package makes an official suspicious, for instance if it is leaking or has protruding wires, it will be inspected, industry sources said. Sometimes, cargo on freight planes is tracked by only packing lists or manifests. All cargo on passenger planes, on the other hand, which carry about 16 percent of all cargo that comes into, leaves and travels within the United States, are bound by the August law to have physical inspections using technology and other means. Those screening measures are conducted by private contractors, officials of a foreign government or by American customs officials in some countries. In addition, planes carrying only freight that are scheduled to transfer to a passenger flight are subject to the full screening law. But as the G.A.O. noted in a June 2010 report, the federal government has yet to meet these requirements for inbound air cargo on passenger flights. “Even though it is subject to the law, it is not yet being screened 100 percent,” Mr. Lord said. “T.S.A. is still devising a system to screen this cargo. That is a potential vulnerability.” In a statement, the transportation administration said that it screens 100 percent of all cargo on domestic flights as well as 100 percent of what it described as "high-risk" international inbound air cargo packages on passenger planes. However, a T.S.A. official declined to say what percentage of cargo on international cargo flights is screened. Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who was an author of the August law, said, “Given the terrorist threats that we face, the need for continued vigilance is clear when it comes to cargo on aircraft.” Over all, 20 million pounds of cargo is transported on domestic and inbound passenger aircraft daily. Officials of both FedEx and United Parcel Service declined to provide details about their screening practices but said their procedures exceeded federal regulations. Both carriers said that they rely on contract carriers in Yemen and do not fly their own planes there. On Friday, the companies said that they had embargoed shipments from Yemen or suspended service from that country. The suspcious package intercepted in England was shipped through United Parcel Service. Karen Cole, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to say whether a company plane carried that package at any point in its route. Maury S. Lane, a spokesman for FedEx, said the carrier learned that a suspect package might be at its Dubai facility when it was contacted by the F.B.I. and local authorities in Dubai. “We were contacted, and the package was intercepted shortly afterwards,” Mr. Lane said. Michael D. Whatley, a partner at HBW Resources, which is a consulting firm for the Air Cargo Security Alliance, an organization that represents freight forwarders, said that there is no way to force American standards on other countries loading cargo bound for the United States. “That is a huge hole,” said Mr. Whatley. “So we have to rely on international treaties and bilateral negotiations and all the different tools that we have as a country to get the other countries to do it on their territory.” Aviation officials have been under Congressional pressure for nearly a decade to ensure that air cargo loaded onto passenger planes is checked for possible explosives. Critics have argued it made no sense for the United States to have spent billions of dollars to examine all carry-on bags and checked baggage but allow cargo to be loaded onto passenger planes without scrutiny. Congress, frustrated with the progress, mandated in 2007 that the Transportation Security Administration take steps to ensure that all air cargo on passenger planes be inspected — on domestic flights and international flights headed to the United States — by August 2010. Homeland Security recently acknowledged it would not meet the deadline for international cargo. Earlier this year, Gale D. Rossides, then acting director of the Transportation Security Administration, , told a House committee that about 80 to 85 percent of international cargo headed for passenger planes would be inspected as of the August deadline, and cited the difficulty of getting certain international airports to comply. “We’re visiting these countries,” Ms. Rossides told a House Homeland Security subcommittee in June. “We’re giving them our standards. We’re assisting them with teams of T.S.A. experts.” The G.A.O. audit said that part of the problem is that the Transportation Security Administration as of earlier this year had not approved the use of devices to screen large pallets or containers of cargo. A significant amount of air cargo headed to the United States is also given an exemption from screening if it is in shrink-wrapped bundles, based on an assumption that the shipper knows the contents are secure, the audit said. Perhaps more troubling, the audit found that the agency could not say for sure that air carriers are complying with the mandates to screen cargo even at airports where the system is supposedly in place. The inspections are done by private companies, not government security officers, and the federal government does not have a reliable way to monitor the process.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/business/17fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx to Cut 1,700 Freight Jobs<date>Published: September 16, 2010</date><text>FedEx said on Thursday that it would cut 1,700 jobs in its United States freight business to offset losses in that unit.The news came as the company announced that its first-quarter net income doubled, helped by strength in international shipping, and raised its financial outlook. But projections for the second quarter and full year fell shy of Wall Street expectations. FedEx shares dropped 3.8 percent, or $3.22, to $82.72 on the New York Stock Exchange. International air shipments have driven FedEx’s results for more than a year; international revenue rose 24 percent in the quarter ended Aug. 31. But while FedEx earned $380 million in the first quarter, the FedEx Freight segment lost $16 million and has been unprofitable for four straight quarters. The unit moves large items like refrigerators and other appliances from factories to retailers and competes with trucking companies like Arkansas Best and YRC Worldwide. Sluggish demand and heated competition in this segment of the American market has forced FedEx to forgo the rate increases that are helping its other segments grow. The freight unit, started in 2001, is separate from FedEx Ground, which trucks packages directly to consumers. FedEx will combine its FedEx Freight and FedEx National less-than-truckload operations on Jan. 30 and close 100, or 20 percent, of its service centers. (Less-than-truckload shipping takes goods from many different manufacturers and consolidates them into a single truck for delivery.) The 1,700 job cuts represent about 5 percent of the freight division’s workers. FedEx has about 280,000 employees over all. The company says the move, along with other cost cuts, will ensure the freight business is profitable next year. FedEx said it earned $380 million, or $1.20 a share, in the fiscal first-quarter that ended in August. That compared with $181 million, or 58 cents a share, a year ago and was slightly under the $1.21 a share that Wall Street had expected. Revenue rose 18 percent to $9.46 billion. The reinstatement of some employee compensation programs, higher pension, medical and aircraft maintenance expenses — as well as the loss at FedEx Freight — countered improvements at the Express and Ground operations. For the current quarter that ends in November, FedEx expects to earn $1.15 to $1.35 a share. Analysts are expecting $1.36 a share. For the fiscal year that ends in May, FedEx forecast net income of $4.80 to $5.25 a share. That is up from a previous estimate of $4.60 to $5.20 a share. But some analysts are forecasting up to $5.60 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. “We expect a very solid peak season,” said T. Michael Glenn, a FedEx executive vice president, referring to the holiday shipping period. “It always gets a little cloudy after that.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/sports/golf/09golf.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Even in 20th Season, Journeyman Gillis Doesn’t Like Shortcuts<date>Published: September 8, 2010</date><text>LEMONT, Ill. — Although the prospect of winning the PGA Tour Playoffs for the FedEx Cup and its $10 million bonus is real for some of the 70 players in the BMW Championship, there are others, like Tom Gillis, whose entire year will be made just by making the 30-man field for the Tour Championship in two weeks.It is a little stunning, however, when Gillis, an obscure 41-year-old journeyman, says he thinks some of the FedEx Cup perks may be a little too much — like exemptions into the first three major championships in 2011, and into the World Golf Championship event at Doral. “You could have someone getting into the major championships just because they got hot for a couple weeks in the playoffs,” said Gillis, who has qualified for three United States Opens and two British Opens during his 20-year professional career. “I think that’s a little too high for the value received. I think it should still be based on the money list.” That provides a glimpse into the work ethic of Gillis, a solidly-built man who is the very embodiment of a journeyman. Until last week, few beyond the golf world knew who he was. Even after he finished fifth at the Deutsche Bank Championship — his highest finish on the PGA Tour — one writer who regularly covers the tour summarized his knowledge of Gillis by saying, “I could not pick Tom Gillis out of a lineup of guys named Tom Gillis.” Gillis is now in a lineup with guys named Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, on the game’s biggest stage, playing for more money than he ever imagined. During his odyssey through golf’s hinterlands, which began in 1990 with five unremarkable years in Europe and was later highlighted by finishes of 139th and 156th during PGA Tour seasons in 2003 and 2005, Gillis suffered through three wrist operations and a lot of self doubt. “If we talked about the journey we’d be here a long time,” Gillis said Wednesday, adding, “I still know for a fact and I believe in my heart I can win out here. It’s very gratifying. I mean, I’m humbled that I’m this far, and I still think I can go farther.” It is telling that Gillis believes he can win. He was on the verge of quitting professional golf a few years ago, but decided instead to work his way through, to somehow get back to the PGA Tour before his small window of opportunity closed for good. In 2007, he began working with a Canadian teacher, Jeff Leishman, who lives in Jupiter, Fla., where he also coaches tour players like Richard Johnson and Will MacKenzie. By 2009, Gillis had completely changed his swing, eliminating a steep move that had caused his wrist injuries and making over his putting, which improved from 130th in the rankings during his last stint on the tour to 17th this year. The changes in Gillis’s game began last year on the Nationwide Tour, a place he said he believed was beneath him when he first went there after his years in Europe. This time around, he made the most of the opportunity, moving up the money list with a late-season win in the Players Cup and continuing the climb with a second-place finish and a tie for third that put him second over all on the money list. That gave him a PGA Tour exemption for 2010. Now Gillis is at 48th on the points list, one spot ahead of Angel Cabrera and three ahead of Woods, who is in a battle of his own to get to the Tour Championship in Atlanta. Woods has none of the eligibility concerns that Gillis has for next season, but both have an intense desire to win and a belief that they can. “To be quite honest with you, I would say I’m disappointed right now,” Gillis said. “I would have thought I’d have had more chances to win. I think some of it is probably just a little inexperience for being in those situations and on that stage. There’s a lot going on on Sunday, and I think you learn to deal with it, and I believe I dealt with it much better last week. “I think that’s probably what I’m proudest of, finishing 65-65 on the weekend,” he added. “I’m really happy with the way I handled that part of it, the mental part that I had been struggling with before.” If he can duplicate the finish this week at Cog Hill that he had last week at TPC Boston, he will be in the Tour Championship. He says he can. “Has it taken a little longer than I thought to be in contention?” he said. “I’d say, ‘Yeah, it has.’ I really, in my heart .... I think as a player you’ve got to think, why would you play if you didn’t think you could win? And I thought I could, and I still think I can.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/27fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Raises Its Earnings Outlook for Year<date>Published: July 26, 2010</date><text>The FedEx Corporation, the package delivery company, raised its earnings outlook for the current quarter and full year on Monday, citing an increase in demand for shipping.The company said a boom in air and truck shipments was being driven by its international priority service, which ships high-value goods like computers, iPhones and e-readers. Shipments are particularly strong out of Asia. Besides gadgets, the company’s next-largest international priority segments are electrical components like disk drives and flash memory, vehicle components, luxury goods and drugs and medical supplies. International priority shipments are expected to increase 20 percent this quarter. Because of its renewed optimism in its business, the company said it would fully reinstate the company match for 401(k) plans across the company on Jan. 1. FedEx rescinded the match when the economy was near its worst point, and said it would reinstate a 50 percent match for most employees in the United States late last year. The cost of the move is included in the company’s new earnings forecast. The company expects to earn $1.05 to $1.25 a share in its first fiscal quarter, which ends Aug. 31, up from 58 cents a share a year earlier. The forecast is up from its previous guidance of 85 cents to $1.05 a share. Analysts expected $1.01 a share. For the full fiscal year ending in May, FedEx expects earnings of $4.60 to $5.20 a share, up from its earlier guidance of $4.40 to $5 a share, reflecting the current market outlook for fuel prices and a continued moderate recovery in the global economy. Analysts expected earnings of $4.98. The company reported earnings of $3.76 a share last year. The company said its volume growth rates are running on pace with the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in May. In that period, international priority average daily shipments grew by 23 percent. Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, rose $4.43, or 5.61 percent, to $83.39 on Monday.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16fri3.html?ref=fedexcorporation">What About Air Safety?<date>Published: July 15, 2010</date><text>Last year’s crash of a commuter plane near Buffalo, which killed 50 people, highlighted the need for more stringent pilot training and tougher rules about how long pilots can fly before they are required to rest. Those reforms have been irresponsibly sidetracked by one of Capitol Hill’s nastiest and most expensive lobbying fights over the unrelated issue of unionization rules at the rival delivery companies, FedEx and United Parcel Service. The complex bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration would require more hours in training for commercial pilots and a closer watch on their flight schedules. The House and Senate have passed versions of the reauthorization with the sensible new safety rules. But the legislation has stalled as the two corporations and their hugely well-paid lobbyists battle over whether the unionization standards for U.P.S. package deliverers should also be applied to FedEx’s ground workers. The nation is fortunate that the standoff has now galvanized a less dollar-driven lobbying force — the families of the victims in last year’s tragedy. They are buttonholing lawmakers with a question: What’s happening with passenger safety? The House’s aviation bill, led by Representative James Oberstar, a Democrat of Minnesota and a union champion, would finally put the two companies on the same footing. Mr. Oberstar argues adamantly that a Republican Congress unfairly allowed FedEx special antiunion protections in 1996, and this needs to be corrected. The Senate-passed measure has no such provision. And a filibuster is threatened to protect FedEx by Senators Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, Republicans of Tennessee, where, of course, FedEx is based. Far more than parochial posturing is at stake in the bill, which also includes modernization of the air traffic control system. Both sides remain unyielding on the union fight. We sympathize with Representative Oberstar’s point and find the filibuster threat on behalf of FedEx shameless. Congress needs to rise above this to serve the one special interest most at stake: air passenger safety.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/business/17fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Reports $419 Million Quarterly Profit<date>Published: June 16, 2010</date><text>FedEx, the package delivery company, swung to a fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday and offered a conservative outlook that relied on international sales, an area that also led growth in the last three months.FedEx reported a profit of $419 million in the fourth quarter, in contrast to a loss of $876 million in the quarter a year ago. The company said it had net income of $1.18 billion for 2010, up from $98 million a year ago. Revenue rose 20 percent, to $9.43 billion, in the quarter that ended May 31. Earnings were $1.33 a share, in the upper range of its forecast of $1.17 to $1.37. The company lost $2.82 a share in the quarter a year ago. Analysts, including Matthew S. Brooklier of the Piper Jaffray investment firm, expected $1.32 a share. But the share price fell 5.95 percent after FedEx offered a subdued forecast based on stable fuel prices and “a continued moderate recovery.” FedEx forecast earnings of $4.40 to $5 for 2011, driven by international trade that seemed unhampered by European sovereign debt concerns and volatile financial markets. Analysts had expected a 2011 forecast of $5.05 a share. “I think the $5 is a great number,” the managing director of Morgan Keegan, Arthur W. Hatfield, said. “It won’t be the peak number. It will go up from there. We should continue to see growth beyond the $5 number.” FedEx’s chief financial officer, Alan B. Graf Jr., said in a statement that the company’s outlook included higher pension and health care costs as well as aircraft maintenance. Mr. Hatfield said the softer-than-expected outlook for the year was still positive news. “What was most important about the guidance was internal cost issues ramped up, but it’s not the economy,” said Mr. Hatfield about the aircraft maintenance, employee compensation and health care costs. “They still think the economy is going to grow.” While FedEx’s results are typically considered a bellwether for the United States economy, Daniel L. Ortwerth, transportation analyst with the Edward Jones investment firm, said he would “caution anyone to interpret these results as a strong positive indicator for the U.S.” because FedEx’s growth outlook focused on its services abroad. “A company in this business needs to think globally, and that’s exactly what this company is doing,” he said. The company freight segment, which is largely dependent on North America, reported a $36 million loss in the quarter on lower yields and higher volume-related costs, compared with a loss of $106 million a year ago. Kevin W. Sterling, senior vice president of BB&amp;T Capital Markets, said the 23 percent increase in FedEx’s International Priority average daily package volume, mainly because of exports from Asia, was impressive. FedEx spent $2.8 billion on capital expenditures for the fiscal year. The company projects capital expenditures of $3.2 billion next year, also to bolster its international services. The $3.2 billion exceeded Mr. Ortwerth’s estimates, but he said he considered it a sign the company had the financial health to continue its expansion. David J. Bronczek, the chief executive of FedEx Express, said financial events in Europe did not stunt FedEx Express’s business in Europe. “We’ve seen solid growth in Europe, as our numbers would indicate, double-digit growth,” he said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/business/19fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Profit Doubles, Aided by Strong Business in Asia<date>Published: March 18, 2010</date><text>The FedEx Corporation raised its fiscal-year outlook on Thursday after quarterly profit more than doubled, with strong Asian export volumes more than compensating for flat domestic demand.Led by exports from Asia, FedEx reported an 18 percent jump in volume from its International Priority business. But average daily domestic package volume rose just 1 percent, reflecting the weak American economy. FedEx and its larger rival, United Parcel Service, tend to do their best at the beginning of a recovery, analysts said. FedEx raised its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $3.60 to $3.80 a share from a previous outlook of $3.45 to $3.75. Analysts on average expected $3.64, according to Thomson Reuters. The company said profit for the third quarter, which ended Feb. 28, rose to $239 million, or 76 cents a share, from $97 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. That bested the analysts’ average estimate of 72 cents a share. Revenue rose 7 percent to $8.7 billion, higher than the average Wall Street forecast of $8.4 billion. “An improving global economy drove solid financial performance in the quarter,” Fred Smith, the company’s chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts. “In fact, the recovery is broadening.” FedEx and U.P.S. handle such a huge chunk of American and global shipping that they are considered economic bellwethers. FedEx said it had reinstated employee compensation programs it had cut earlier in response to the recession, despite the dampening effect they will have on earnings in the fourth quarter and into 2011. The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.17 to $1.37 a share. Analysts expected $1.26. FedEx also raised its capital spending outlook for 2010 to $2.9 billion, from $2.6 billion, citing additional investments in Boeing aircraft. And it said it was taking aircraft out of storage in the desert for a return to service. FedEx shares gained $2.87, or more than 3 percent, to $92.67 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DB163AF931A35751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=fedexcorporation">Corrections<date>Published: February 2, 2010</date><text>An article on Jan. 19 about a public protest by the Guatemalan government over the arrest of three Guatemalan men at a Florida office of a shipping company gave an outdated name for the company.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Immigration and Emigration Suspecting that the passport was fraudulent, FedEx officials called Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to alert them when the Guatemalans arrived to collect the package, officials of the immigration agency said. Two of the Guatemalans were illegal immigrants who have been deported, and one is in deportation proceedings. Guatemalan diplomats said that FedEx and American officials had examined and seized legitimate passports without notifying them and had improperly disrupted their dealings with Guatemalan citizens living in this country. Felipe Alejos, the Guatemalan consul in Miami, said the events appeared to violate basic diplomatic protocols. “They seized official documents, and they did not let us know,” Mr. Alejos said. “There was coordination between FedEx and ICE to detain people.” FedEx officials said they had followed routine company procedures when they contacted immigration authorities after detecting packages that suggested organized document fraud. Officials from the immigration agency, known as ICE, said they arrested the Guatemalans only after two of them tried to flee from the FedEx office. Both the company and the immigration agency denied that they had collaborated to lure the immigrants to the office. The arrests started a rumor mill of fears in communities along the Florida coast, where many immigrants, both legal and illegal, have settled. “When people in the community perceive that FedEx acted as an agent for immigration, it undermines their belief that they can collect their mail and trust in their government,” said John De León, a lawyer for the Guatemalan consulate in Miami. The now disputed chain of events began in November when Guatemalan consular officials based in Miami held a daylong session in Jupiter, Fla., to help Guatemalans in the area resolve problems with birth certificates, passports and other documents. Dozens of Guatemalans signed up for new or renewed passports, which are useful as a form of identification in this country. The Guatemalan government prints and distributes passports for its citizens living in the United States through a private company, De La Luz, in Metairie, La. In December, the company sent the new passports in FedEx Ground packages to the Guatemalans who had applied for them. At least 30 packages could not be delivered to the addresses listed, said a FedEx spokeswoman, Allison Sobczak, and the shipper in Louisiana did not respond to telephone calls. FedEx employees opened several packages searching for better address information, she said. “This was a normal routine for us to open a package and inspect it to try to get a correct shipping address,” Ms. Sobczak said. Since the passports included no paperwork indicating they were official, FedEx contacted ICE “to make sure the documents were legitimate,” she said. Damaris Roxana Vasquez, 21, a Guatemalan living in Jupiter, said that on Jan. 6, she and three Guatemalan men drove to a FedEx office in Riviera Beach to pick up a new passport for one of the men. When they arrived, she said in an interview, FedEx employees told them to wait because they could not locate the package. FedEx employees called ICE agents, who were already on their way to the office, to advise them that customers had come to pick up a suspect package, ICE officials said. When the agents arrived, two of the men tried to flee, said an ICE spokeswoman, Nicole Navas. One escaped; the other two men and Ms. Vasquez were detained, and the men later deported. Ms. Vasquez has been released while her deportation case proceeds. Her 5-year-old son, who was with her, was not detained because he is a United States citizen. ICE seized the undelivered passports, agency officials said. After an investigation showed they were legitimate, ICE officials returned them to the Guatemalan consulate last week. “Document fraud poses a severe threat to national security and public safety,” Ms. Navas said. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 2, 2010 An article on Jan. 19 about a public protest by the Guatemalan government over the arrest of three Guatemalan men at a Florida office of a shipping company gave an outdated name for the company. It is FedEx, not Federal Express. The article also misstated the name of the FedEx division that shipped a package containing a Guatemalan passport for one of the men arrested.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » Although FedEx expects a modest economic recovery to continue next year, the company said “there is some uncertainty regarding the sustainability of current demand trends after our peak shipping season.” The company predicted earnings of 50 to 70 cents a share in the current quarter, well under analysts’ expectations of 84 cents a share. Despite the cautious near-term forecast, the company said many economic indicators appeared to be turning positive. The chief executive, chairman and president, Frederick W. Smith, said in a conference call he believed that the nation’s economy “reached a turning point” in recent months. Mr. Smith noted that industrial demand turned positive compared with last year and that manufacturers started buying again. In the quarter, FedEx earned $345 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with $493 million, or $1.58 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Nov. 30 and was the second quarter of FedEx’s fiscal year, fell to $8.6 billion, from $9.54 billion. Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, fell $5.48, to $84.47. FedEx reported sales declines of more than 10 percent in major segments, including express, freight and services. But revenue in the company’s ground segment rose 3 percent, mostly because of added volume from a partnership with the United States Postal Service and DHL’s exit from the United States market. FedEx is adding more flight hours to meet international demand in the current quarter, which will increase its costs. The company cut flight hours by 6 percent during the last quarter as it used fewer and more fuel-efficient airplanes. But as package volume started picking up in the quarter, especially in Asia and Latin America, FedEx scheduled more flights.

Instead of using a key, I borrowed one of the radio frequency ID tags that drivers swipe over a reader, and I hit the “engine start” button to get rolling. Skip to next paragraph Related (November 29, 2009) The keyless ignition is one feature that FedEx added to the W700, a truck made by Freightliner that can carry up to 6,000 pounds of packages. The truck’s big difference is its hybrid system, made by the Eaton Corporation. The W700 runs on diesel fuel like most FedEx trucks, but it also has an electric motor that not only drives the wheels but also generates electricity when the truck slows down. The energy is stored in a 190-pound lithium-ion battery, made by Hitachi, that is mounted on the undercarriage. The extra push delivered by the electric motor when accelerating reduces fuel consumption by about 30 percent. Unlike many hybrid passenger cars, though, the truck’s diesel engine continues to run even at a stoplight, so the hybrid is as noisy as a diesel-only model. But it had peppy acceleration, and the truck’s transmission automatically shifted gears, reaching 30 miles per hour without a hiccup. Some FedEx drivers complain that the trucks do not have enough power going uphill, but Paul Baietto, a mechanic at the FedEx Express Harlem River truck yard, insisted that the trucks are adequately powered. “The hybrids are excellent below 20 miles per hour and that’s what most of the driving is,” Mr. Baietto said. This driver had no reason to disagree.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Joao Silva for The New York Times At a recent trade fair in Baghdad, companies from several nations were on hand to promote goods and services, but companies from the United States were notably absent. Above, a corporate booth at the fair’s Iranian pavilion. Add to Portfolio KBR Inc FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Joao Silva for The New York Times The Turkish pavilion at the international trade fair in Baghdad. That would be the country that spent a trillion dollars  on the invasion and occupation, but also on training and equipping Iraqi security forces, and on ambitious reconstruction projects in every province aimed at rebuilding the country and restarting the economy. Yet when the post-Saddam Iraqi government swept out its old commercial fairgrounds and invited companies from around the world, the United States was not much in evidence among the 32 nations represented. Of the 396 companies that exhibited their wares, “there are two or three American participants, but I can’t remember their names,” said Hashem Mohammed Haten, director general of Iraq’s state fair company. A pair of missiles atop a ceremonial gateway to the fairgrounds recalled an era when Saddam Hussein had pretensions, if not weapons, of mass destruction. The trade fair is a telling indication of an uncomfortable truth: America’s war in Iraq has been good for business in Iraq  but not necessarily for American business. American companies are not seeing much lasting benefit from their country’s investment in Iraq. Some American businesses have calculated that the high security costs and fear of violence make Iraq a business no-go area. Even those who are interested and want to come are hampered by American companies’ reputation here for overcharging and shoddy workmanship, an outgrowth of the first years of the occupation, and a lasting and widespread anti-Americanism. While Iraq’s imports nearly doubled in 2008, to $43.5 billion from $25.67 billion in 2007, imports from American companies stayed flat at $2 billion over that period. Among investors, the United Arab Emirates leads the field, with $31 billion invested in Iraq, most of that in 2008, compared to only about $400 million from American companies when United States government reconstruction spending is excluded, according to Dunia Frontier Consultants, a emerging-market analyst. “Following this initial U.S.-dominated reconstruction phase, U.S. private investors have become negligible players in Iraq,” Dunia said in a report. Indeed, even those companies that prospered during the war and occupation, including many of the big military contractors, will simply leave with the United States military as it completes its pullout over the next two years. KBR was among the earliest contractors in Iraq and has $33 billion in contracts to support American bases. Yet it has not had any contracts with the Iraqi government to support those facilities when they’re handed over  or for that matter, to build anything else in the country. “KBR is currently assessing the business environment in Iraq in order to make an informed decision regarding potential government contract opportunities there,” said a spokesperson, Heather Browne. A few big American multinationals, like Bechtel, will still be in the midst of long-term projects like power plants and waterworks  but those were five- and 10-year undertakings kick-started with American reconstruction aid. Now, Iraq is doling out its own oil-financed funds for capital projects, and American companies have so far received surprisingly little of it. Sports City, a billion-dollar complex of stadiums and housing in Basra planned for the Gulf Games in 2013, was awarded to an Iraqi general contractor, Al Jiburi Construction, over 60 other bidders, many of them American. “We have a couple American companies as our subcontractors,” said Adai al-Sultani, an assistant to the firm’s owner, with evident pride. When the transportation ministry put up more than $30 billion in railroad expansion contracts recently, they went to Czech, British and Italian companies. Those nations had been members of the coalition led by the United States, although all pulled outlong before the United States. But one of the biggest beneficiaries of Iraqi contract money is Turkey, which wouldn’t allow American warplanes to use its airbases during the invasion of Iraq, followed closely by Iran. Turkey has gone from almost no legal trade with Iraq before the war to $10 billion in exports last year, five times as much as the United States. Turkey’s trade minister, Kursad Tuzmen, predicted that number would triple in the next couple years. Both Turkey and Iran had huge pavilions at the trade fair, crowded with businessmen discussing deals. So did France and Brazil, also not coalition countries. Last month, FedEx, which had been flying packages in and out of Iraq since 2004, announced it was suspending its operations. The reason is that Iraqi officials gave RusAir, a Russian airline, exclusive rights to cargo flights. FedEx was one of the very few American businesses that braved the risks of working not only on American bases but also in the Red Zone, back when it was particularly dangerous to do so. Now that the danger is much less, its business is being thwarted by an upstart Russian come-lately. 1 2 Next Page » Mohammed Hussein and Saad al-Izzi contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Yuri Gripas/Reuters A FedEx driver delivering packages in Washington, D.C. The company said it planned to raise its rates in the United States. Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » But the company, an economic bellwether, said most of its markets were continuing to show signs of improvement, raising the prospect of a wider rebound that might help lift other companies and sectors out of the slump. “Confidence appears to be improving, the housing sector seems to have bottomed and the auto sales have picked up,” Frederick W. Smith, the chairman, chief executive and president of FedEx, said in a conference call to discuss the results. “These are encouraging signs of a more stable economy.” FedEx said it planned to increase shipping rates in the United States an average of 5.9 percent for domestic and export services, effective Jan. 4, a sign of confidence in a market where excess capacity had been pressuring pricing. FedEx reported a profit of $181 million, or 58 cents a share, for the first quarter that ended on Aug. 31, down from $384 million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20 percent to $8.01 billion, from $9.97 billion a year ago. Lower energy prices weighed on the company’s numbers, resulting in what FedEx characterized as a “substantial decline” in fuel surcharges. But it said the planned rate increase in the new year would help offset declining revenues from the surcharges, which lag real-time prices and had helped lift profitability over the last year as oil prices plummeted. FedEx’s main rival, United Parcel Service, has not disclosed plans to raise 2010 rates, though the two companies tend to track one another closely. The exit of DHL from the market in January has strengthened the hand of the two remaining players. The results announced on Thursday were better than FedEx had originally forecast, but were not a surprise. Last week, the company disclosed its results, saying it would report first-quarter earnings of 58 cents a share. It also said second-quarter earnings would be 65 to 95 cents, an outlook it reiterated on Thursday. At the time, the company said it was benefiting from an increase in international priority shipments and cost controls. Shares of FedEx, which jumped more than 6 percent last week when the company released figures, gave back some of those gains on Thursday. The shares fell $1.74, or 2.2 percent, to $76.46.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » Its shares were up more than 6 percent in midday trading. The company’s performance is seen as a crucial indicator of overall economic health. Its improved outlook helped support the broader market, which opened with small gains. FedEx said it expected earnings of 58 cents a share for the first quarter that ended Aug. 31. That’s down 53 percent from a year ago, but well above the company’s previous prediction of 30 to 45 cents a share. On average, analysts had been looking for a quarterly profit of 44 cents a share. The company’s shares were up $5.37, or 7.5 percent, to $78.03 in morning trading Friday. FedEx said it raised its forecast because of an increased volume of international priority packages and “strict cost management.” The company has cut salaries, laid off workers and made other cuts in the face of slowing demand. The company also said it expected to earn 65 to 95 cents a share for the second quarter. The company said the forecast reflected a continued modest recovery in the global economy. Analysts currently expect 70 cents a share. Although the company raised its forecast, it hesitated to predict how soon there would be an economic recovery. “Despite some encouraging signs in the global economy, it is difficult to predict the timing and pace of any economic recovery,” Alan B. Graf Jr., the chief financial officer, said in a statement. FedEx is still making less money per package in each of its business segments as fuel charges fall and the freight market remains competitive. The company declined to offer further detail because it was in the quiet period before its report on first-quarter earnings, scheduled for Thursday.

Leader Board Schedule/Results Stats | Earnings Champions Leader Board Schedule/Results Stats | Earnings European Leader Board Schedule/Results Stats | Earnings When it comes to golf, some companies and brands are so ubiquitous that they have blended into the landscape, like the tees, fairways and greens. But during the last three years, FedEx has tried harder than almost any company to stand out. Since 2007, the package delivery company has spent $44 million a year to sponsor the FedEx Cup, a full season of PGA Tour events culminating with a four-tournament playoff series to determine the top men’s golfer. In many ways, the sponsorship is similar to the Nascar Sprint Cup or the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour: an attempt by a major corporation to become one with an entire sport, not just a player or a single event. But in other ways, the FedEx Cup is different. Golf is a more understated sport than Nascar or tennis in that it tends to keep sponsors’ messages muted or at arm’s length. Television commercials are low key, signage is more discreet and logos are modest. That does not seem to bother FedEx, whose first foray into sports marketing was in 1986 with the St. Jude Classic, a golf tournament in Memphis. Like other major golf sponsors, FedEx is trying to reach executives and other corporate decision makers, hoping they will choose FedEx over U.P.S. or the Postal Service. The most avid golf fans, it turns out, include those executives. The PGA Tour has golfers from around the world and its events are broadcast worldwide, both of which attracted FedEx. “This appealed to us because FedEx is a global company, and we needed to communicate to our customers on a global stage,” said Kevin Demsky, the director of sponsorship marketing at FedEx, whose six-year deal with the PGA Tour runs through 2012. Demsky said FedEx earned positive return on its investment, but he declined to be more specific. Large corporations typically generate three or more dollars in new sales for every dollar spent sponsoring sporting events, according to industry experts. For a company like FedEx, which is recognized by executives and consumers, sponsoring a long-running event makes sense because it provides wide, extended exposure. “It’s a way to get your name out there on a consistent basis without having to latch on to a particular player who might get in trouble, or a single event that Tiger might not show up to,” said Bob Dorfman, who writes a newsletter that analyzes athlete endorsements. “It’s insurance you’re going to get a lot of brand value for your dollar.” Golf might seem an odd choice for FedEx. The company’s image is one of speed, while golf is known for its slow pace. But FedEx also promotes its reliability and consistency, traits that successful golfers need, said Bill Sutton, a professor of sports business at the University of Central Florida. FedEx’s affiliation with the PGA Tour, though, is not as well known as Sprint’s relationship with Nascar. Sprint is embedded in the fabric of Nascar, which relies on the company to help run its events, including news conferences before and after races. Sprint has also designed audio and video applications for cellphones to help fans follow the races. “We’ve tried to make it much more than banners, tickets and hospitality,” said Dave Mellin, a Sprint spokesman. During live telecasts and replays of Nascar events last year, Sprint’s name or logo was shown on screen for a total of 90 hours 6 minutes 21 seconds, according to Joyce Julius &amp; Associates, a sports marketing research firm. The Sprint name was mentioned 1,476 times during those broadcasts  more than twice as often as the next brand, Toyota. “Nascar is the top dog in terms of exposure,” said Eric Wright, a vice president at Joyce Julius, who added that the tally did not include Sprint’s name being mentioned on highlight programs or news broadcasts. Still, FedEx is getting its money’s worth because the demographic of golf fans matches the audience it wants to reach. FedEx also gets to be associated with winning players, even though it does not have an endorsement deal with a player. And in a recession, when other companies are backing out of sports sponsorships, FedEx is sending a message. “They are telling the public that they are worth their attention,” Sutton said. “It’s the people who back away and hide, the world will pass them by.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on August 27, 2009, on page F2 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/business/media/20adco.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Madison Avenue Will Be Watching FedEx’s Web Videos<date>Published: July 19, 2009</date><text>FEDEX has been something of an advertising bellwether. Its 1981 spot, by Ally &amp; Gargano, topped New York magazine’s list last year of “most memorable” ads of the last four decades: it featured the fast-talking actor John Moschitta Jr. delivering alliterative lines  “Peter, you did a bang up job. I’m putting you in charge of Pittsburgh, Peter. I know it’s perfect, Peter; that’s why I picked Pittsburgh.” Skip to next paragraph The actor Fred Willard said his spoofs for FedEx seemed more like sketch comedy than infomercials. Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » FedEx’s spots  for the last 20 years by BBDO Worldwide, New York, part of the Omnicom Group  helped pioneer office humor in ads, and often had their premieres during the Super Bowl. So when the company announced that after 18 years it would forgo advertising during the last Super Bowl, because it could not justify the expense during the downturn, the news resonated. “That hurt the Super Bowl much more than any other advertiser, because FedEx is a market leader,” said Jerry Della Femina, who is chief executive of Della Femina Rothschild Jeary &amp; Partners and has worked on Madison Avenue since the early 1960s. “Look, you never bet against Federal Express, because they’re smart, and when they’re doing something, it’s well thought out.” The company is certain to be watched closely Monday, then, as it unveils its first Web-video advertising campaign, five three-minute films that feature the actor Fred Willard. While some notable viral online campaigns, like Burger King’s famous “subservient chicken,” have aimed to be entertaining enough to find huge audiences but which talked little if at all about products, the FedEx videos are tongue-in-cheek infomercials that extol FedEx’s services. The skits parody infomercials while reaping that format’s benefits: using a long-form pitch to be more descriptive than a 30-second spot allows. Directed by Bob Odenkirk, who has written for shows like “Saturday Night Live” and “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” and who starred in the HBO series “Mr. Show With Bob and David,” they will appear on a dedicated YouTube channel, youtube.com/getinfotained, and on FedEx’s own Web site. The shipping company needs a successful campaign. Pummeled by the downturn and high fuel prices  not to mention technological advances that allow increasingly complex documents to be transferred electronically  the company lost $876 million in the quarter that ended May 31, compared with a $241 million loss for the quarter a year earlier.  In the videos, Mr. Willard  whose credits include roles in Christopher Guest mockumentaries like “Best in Show,” “A Mighty Wind,” and “For Your Consideration”  hosts infomercials called “1-2-3 Succeed!” with a studio audience, also actors. The spots tend toward rapid-fire sight gags and surreal humor, as when Mr. Willard is promoting FedEx’s package-tracking service and asks, “Who likes to track things?” As the camera pans the audience, it lingers on a man applauding who is dressed in a beaver cap and fringed frontiersman costume. In a segment highlighting FedEx Office (formerly FedEx Kinko’s), Mr. Willard asks, “What’s the one thing every business wants to be known for?” “Dinosaurs!” shouts one audience member. “Ponies!” shouts another. And another: “Nitrogen!” “That’s a given,” replies Mr. Willard, unimpressed and wearing one of a series of busy sweaters like those worn on “The Cosby Show” by Bill Cosby. “The answer is looking professional.” “I really had trouble not reacting to that humor. I was trying to do it completely serious because the atmosphere was very funny,” Mr. Willard said in a telephone interview, adding that the project seemed more like sketch comedy than commercial work. “It felt very much like a Second City or Groundlings set.” (Mr. Willard first performed at Second City, the improv theater that originated in Chicago, in the 1960s.) Michael Smith, a BBDO creative director on the project, said the pace was more frenetic than typical FedEx spots for a reason. “It’s one thing to capture someone’s attention, but another thing to hold them for three minutes,” Mr. Smith said. “And on the Internet, you’re competing against everything else on the Internet, which is one finger-click away, so engagement becomes a critical element.” FedEx unveiled another online campaign in June, but it was a public relations rather than advertising effort, not executed by BBDO. The company built a Web site, BrownBailout.com, that equated proposed legislation that would make it easier for FedEx employees to unionize with a government bailout for a competitor, U.P.S. Criticized by the Teamsters union and others for portraying the prospect as a bailout, the effort was hardly viral: FedEx has posted three videos on a dedicated BrownBailout.com channel on YouTube, with one attracting fewer than 6,000 viewings, and each of the others fewer than 2,000.  Steve Pacheco, director of advertising at FedEx, said the new infomercial campaign reflected FedEx’s acknowledgment of the growing sentiment that “lunchtime is the new prime time,” meaning that the multitudes who watch videos online while chomping sandwiches in cubicles rival those wielding remote controls at night. “We’re still very involved in television, especially with all our sports and sponsorship support,” Mr. Pacheco said. “But digital advertising and communication is taking a bigger role in the overall plan, because we try to scale our media plan to be where our customers are.” While FedEx is not pulling the plug on television, a return to the Super Bowl, which this year cost $3 million for a 30-second spot, is an open question. “We’re going to take it day by day,” Mr. Pacheco said about future Super Bowls. “Now that we’ve backed out it makes it harder year to year  once it comes off the boards it’s harder to get it back on the plan.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on July 20, 2009, on page B4 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/us/politics/18influence.html?ref=fedexcorporation">A Conservative Organization Is Accused of Offering Help in a Labor Dispute for a Price<date>Published: July 17, 2009</date><text>WASHINGTON  The American Conservative Union, which bills itself as the nation’s oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, has found itself fending off charges that it put its principles up for sale.

More Politics News In a letter sent last month to FedEx, the group offered its support in a bitter legislative dispute with United Parcel Service, but said it wanted a contract of up to $3.4 million to wage a campaign to win support for FedEx’s position. When FedEx did not agree, executives at the company said, the conservative group’s chairman, David A. Keene, turned around and signed a letter using the group’s logo endorsing the UPS view and blasting FedEx. The group’s letter to FedEx, dated June 30, and the subsequent Keene letter were first reported Friday by Politico on its Web site. Dennis E. Whitfield, executive vice president of the lobbying group, released a statement on Friday saying that Mr. Keene, who has been a longtime influential figure in conservative political circles, had signed the letter supporting UPS in his personal capacity and that the group was still supporting FedEx. Maury Lane, a FedEx spokesman, said that he thought that explanation was “disingenuous” and that it was implausible to contend that Mr. Keene had acted in his individual capacity. He noted that the July 15 letter supporting UPS in the dispute included the ACU logo in the letterhead along with those of six other conservative groups and that Mr. Keene’s signature noted he was president of the American Conservative Union. The initial letter from the ACU was written by Mr. Whitfield, and it proposed to a FedEx vice president in the Washington office, Rick Rodgers, an elaborate campaign of building support. “We stand with FedEx in opposition to this legislation,” Mr. Whitfield wrote in a reference to a bill that would change labor law and expand organized union influence across the FedEx empire. Mr. Whitfield, who was a deputy labor secretary in the Reagan administration, wrote, “We support America’s businesses and entrepreneurs,” and “we would like to work with you” to eliminate the proposed provision that would increase union power at FedEx. Mr. Whitfield proposed contacting 150,000 people at least seven times about the supposed dangers of the legislation, at a cost of $2.15 million. The other costs would be for a radio campaign. FedEx declined, Mr. Lane said. Then, on July 15, the letter from a coalition of groups supporting UPS in the dispute was sent to Frederick W. Smith, the FexEx chairman, with the ACU logo and Mr. Keene’s signature. Mr. Whitfield said Friday in his statement that “ACU’s positions on important policy issues have never been for sale,” and that the group “stands with the policy that FedEx should not be placed under” the National Labor Relations Board as provided for in the legislation FedEx is opposing.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image J. B. Reed/Bloomberg News FedEx workers sorted and loaded packages Wednesday at Harlem River Yards in New York. Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » FedEx said it expected a rough ride for some time. “The operating environment for our first two quarters in fiscal 2010 is expected to be extremely difficult,” the chief financial officer, Alan B. Graf Jr., said. FedEx lost $876 million, or $2.82 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended May 31, compared with a loss of $241 million, or 78 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, earnings were 64 cents a share. The company took a $900 million write-down related to the 2004 purchase of Kinko’s  now known as FedEx Office  and $90 million in charges related to a September 2006 acquisition of a trucking company and its affiliates. It also took charges for employee severance and facility cutbacks. Revenue in the period fell 20 percent, to $7.85 billion from $9.87 billion. Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, fell 72 cents, to $50.70. FedEx predicted earnings in the current quarter would drop sharply from a year ago. The company expects a profit of 30 cents to 45 cents a share for the period ending in August, compared with earnings of $1.23 a share a year ago. Mr. Graf said that sluggish manufacturing and another run-up in fuel prices would hold back earnings. Fourth-quarter revenue for the FedEx Express unit dropped 25 percent as the unit moved fewer packages and fuel prices rose. In the freight segment, revenue fell 28 percent. The company’s ground segment did relatively well, with revenue down only about 1 percent from a year ago. That unit was helped by DHL’s exiting the domestic package market and from a delivery partnership with the United States Postal Service. FedEx said that international package volumes improved in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. The company hopes that means the global economy slowdown is leveling off.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp United Parcel Service Inc Go to your Portfolio » In a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign introduced Tuesday, FedEx objected to legislation that would make it easier to unionize the company by accusing its rival, United Parcel Service, of taking a government bailout. The FedEx-sponsored Web site BrownBailout.com (brown is both U.P.S.’s color and nickname) says that U.P.S. is “quietly seeking a Congressional bailout designed to limit competition for overnight deliveries.” Along with a “bailout-o-meter” showing U.P.S.’s revenue, and a spoof of a U.P.S. commercial, the site includes statements like, “This is a bailout, plain and simple, and the American people won’t stand for it.” The real issue here is not government-supplied cash for U.P.S., but the labor laws under which U.P.S. and FedEx are classified. The House recently approved a bill that reclassified a FedEx division, making it easier for unions to form there, and FedEx is fighting that legislation as it goes to the Senate. In effect, FedEx is claiming that passage of the bill would be a bailout for U.P.S. by hampering a competitor. FedEx’s casting of a labor-law dispute as a bailout has raised ire at U.P.S. and at the Teamsters union, which said on Tuesday that it planned to respond with its own public relations campaign.  Some advertising experts said FedEx was putting its own brand at risk by so aggressively attacking a competitor and accusing U.P.S. of taking a federal bailout. “Hinging so much of this  even the site itself and the URL name  to a bailout brings some pretty significant risks,” said Scott Elser, a partner in LaunchPad Advertising, which is not working with either company. “It’s arguably one of the most controversial terms that you can define in politics today. They draw you there based on that, and you don’t have to surf very long to realize that this is clearly not a bailout as most consumers and business people would define it, which is writing a check to a troubled business.” “It’s a little bit of a bait and switch,” Mr. Elser said, which “has the ability to potentially harm their brand.” FedEx is objecting to a provision in a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that the House passed in May. The legislation would classify nonairline employees from FedEx’s Express division, which makes overnight deliveries, under the National Labor Relations Act rather than the Railway Labor Act, which currently governs Express as well as airlines and railroads. The reclassification would make it easier to unionize the division, since N.L.R.A. unions are allowed to form at a company’s individual sites; under the railway act, unions need national support from a majority of a company’s workers. U.P.S., which is heavily unionized, is governed under the N.L.R.A. And it has been lobbying to get its competitor’s Express division classified under that act. “FedEx is appearing to spend millions of dollars to try to convince Congress that a FedEx driver delivering a package is different from a U.P.S. driver delivering a package,” said Malcolm Berkley, a U.P.S. spokesman. Mr. Berkley said it was a competitive issue for U.P.S. “FedEx Express uses the fact of the labor law it is currently under inappropriately as a lever when talking to U.P.S. customers, particularly when we’re negotiating our contracts,” he said. FedEx’s labeling of the legislation as a bailout was wrong, he said. “There’s clearly no way we’re seeking a bailout. In fact, what we’re doing is working to eliminate an earmark that has been given to FedEx for some years,” he said. Executives from the Teamsters, which represents 240,000 U.P.S. workers, also said the bailout campaign was misleading. “It is just the height of hypocrisy for them to allege that there is a bailout of their competitor, when in fact, it’s the company, it’s FedEx, who has benefited from this misclassification of their workers,” said Ken Hall, international vice president and director of the package division at the Teamsters. “It’s laughable to think that they would portray this as some bailout. This is simply leveling the playing field.” While Mr. Berkley said U.P.S. was not planning a campaign in response, the Teamsters would, Mr. Hall said. “Particularly, it’s going to be a grass-roots and an educational program to make sure that those folks in Congress truly understand the issue.” FedEx, meanwhile, has been arguing that the different classification makes sense, since its roots and ways of doing business are different from those of U.P.S. “Our company and U.P.S. are fundamentally different companies,” said Maury Lane, director of communications at FedEx. “They aren’t and shouldn’t be regulated the same way.” As for the bailout characterization, “that piece of legislation only helps one company while hurting a main competitor  if that’s not a bailout, we’re going to have to redefine the word,” he said. Late last year, FedEx’s chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, signaled the company would fight hard against any potential legislation. “We’ve said repeatedly that it is extremely bad public policy,” Mr. Smith said in a conference call with investors. “We would hope that provision would not see the light of day.” Labor experts differed on the companies’ positions. Karen E. Boroff, the dean of the Stillman School of Business at Seton Hall University, said she found FedEx’s arguments persuasive. “FedEx absolutely has a right to be concerned about tiny little bargaining units interrupting the flow of their delivery,” she said. And, she said, workers doing similar jobs were often classified under different labor laws. But James J. Brudney, a law professor at the Moritz College of Law at the Ohio State University, said that FedEx Express’s classification was “a historical anomaly.” “From the workers’ point of view, it seems unfair,” he said.  Advertising executives who reviewed the Web site said that it did some things very well. “I give them credit for inventiveness,” said Steve Centrillo, a principal at A-Team Advisors, a consultant to advertising agencies that is based in New York. Pinning the problems on U.P.S. rather than on unionization helped FedEx avoid sticky labor relations questions, he said. But, Mr. Centrillo said, the use of bailout was “the most questionably ethical thing on the site. “It’s taking a word that is extremely loaded right now, and implying that somehow, the government is writing a check to U.P.S., which is clearly not the case.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on June 10, 2009, on page B10 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/business/23fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Drivers May Not Join Union at FedEx Home, Court Rules<date>Published: April 22, 2009</date><text>Thousands of drivers for the home-delivery subsidiary of the FedEx Corporation do not have the right to join a union because they are independent contractors and not employees, a divided federal appeals court in Washington ruled on Tuesday. The ruling was FedEx Home’s biggest victory in a series of disputes with the Teamsters union, class-action lawyers and state officials over whether it had misclassified its drivers as contractors rather than employees to deny them various benefits and the right to unionize. The ruling overturned a decision by the National Labor Relations Board, which had held that these drivers were employees because they were an essential part of FedEx Home’s business. The labor board also said that the company “exercised substantial control” over the performance of the drivers’ functions, noting that they must dress the way the company wants, operate vehicles that meet the company’s specifications and must display the FedEx logo and colors. In the 2-to-1 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that FedEx Home did not have to bargain with the Teamsters even though a majority of drivers at two terminals in Massachusetts had voted overwhelmingly to join that union. FedEx Home, with 4,000 drivers, is a division of FedEx Ground Packaging Systems and delivers packages up to 75 pounds, mainly to residential customers. The court found that FedEx Home’s drivers have “entrepreneurial potential” and can operate multiple routes and sell routes as well as hire helpers and additional drivers, and therefore should be considered independent contractors. FedEx Home applauded the ruling. Maury Lane, a company spokesman, said the decision and a recent ruling in Washington State “confirm that FedEx Ground contractors are independent business owners who choose to own and operate their own enterprises as they like.” Ken Hall, the director of the Teamsters’ package division, criticized the ruling. “We are confident that the decision will not survive review by the full court or by the U.S. Supreme Court,” he said. “We remain committed to those FedEx drivers who have sought the protection of a legitimate collective bargaining agreement to improve their lives.” In the ruling, Judge Janice Rogers Brown, an appointee of George W. Bush, and Judge Stephen F. Williams, a senior judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, signed the majority opinion. Judge Merrick B. Garland, who was appointed by Bill Clinton, dissented, writing that the drivers should be considered employees. In his dissent, Judge Garland wrote that the drivers had little “entrepreneurial opportunity,” rarely take advantage of it and stand to make little money from selling their trucks or routes. He also argued that for drivers to hire helpers is hardly entrepreneurial and noted that FedEx Home puts limits on drivers’ ability to sell routes and can freely change their routes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs voiced concern that the ruling could affect a nationwide class-action suit involving 27,000 FedEx Ground drivers, who accuse the company of misclassifying them as contractors to deny them overtime and health, retirement and other benefits. Last December, the company agreed to pay $27 million to settle a misclassification lawsuit brought on behalf of 203 drivers in California. In that suit, a state judge wrote that FedEx Ground had “close to absolute control” over the drivers, adding that the operating agreement they signed was “a brilliantly drafted contract creating the constraints of an employment relationship” disguised in the independent contractor model.

The company, based in Memphis, reported net income for its fiscal third quarter, which ended Feb. 28, of $97 million, or 31 cents a share, down from $393 million, or $1.26 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected 46 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. FedEx said third-quarter revenue fell 14 percent, to $8.14 billion, from $9.44 billion in the quarter a year ago. “If this is what FedEx can do in really tough times, imagine what they can do when things bounce back,” said Sandeep Kar, a transportation analyst at the consulting company Frost &amp; Sullivan. “They are going to emerge as a lean and mean company that will experience rapid growth.” Like its main rival, United Parcel Service, FedEx is considered a bellwether of economic activity. When the economy does well, companies and consumers ship more goods; in a recession, package volumes drop. For the current quarter, FedEx said it expected to earn 45 cents to 70 cents a share, below the average of 72 cents expected by analysts. In December, the company said it had suspended matching contributions to its 401(k) retirement plan for a minimum of one year as of Feb. 1 and would impose pay cuts for all salaried personnel. Package volumes at both FedEx and UPS have been hit by the downturn. The Deutsche Post unit DHL closed its American domestic service in January, citing the economic slump and its inability to compete in a market dominated by FedEx and UPS. Shares of FedEx rose 4.76 percent, or $2.05, to $45.10.

Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » FedEx said it had a hiring freeze in place and had cut staff levels at its FedEx Freight and FedEx Office units. FedEx said new measures included a 20 percent base salary decrease for the chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, and pay cuts of 7.5 to 10 percent for other senior executives as of Jan. 1. All other salaried personnel in the United States will have a 5 percent pay cut. According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July, Mr. Smith’s base salary for the company’s fiscal 2009 year was set at about $1.48 million. The company also announced the suspension of matching contributions to FedEx’s 401(k) retirement plan for a minimum of one year as of Feb. 1. FedEx said the cost-cutting measures would reduce expenses by $800 million by the end of its fiscal 2010 year. “Our financial performance is increasingly being challenged by some of the worst economic conditions in the company’s 35-year operating history,” Mr. Smith said in a statement. The company said its quarterly earnings rose to $493 million, or $1.58 a share, from $479 million, or $1.54 a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Nov. 30 and was the second quarter of FedEx’s fiscal year, rose to $9.54 billion, from $9.45 billion. Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, fell 1.37, or about 2 percent, to $62.60.

Analysts were predicting that the company would earn $5.15 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Shares of FedEx fell $8.49, or 11.4 percent, to $65.94 in extended trading. In cutting its profit forecast, the delivery company acknowledged that the slumping economy had trumped lower fuel prices. Some analysts had thought that the news that DHL was ending domestic shipments in the United States would raise FedEx package volumes 3 to 6 percent and give it more power to raise prices. FedEx gave a better outlook for its fiscal second quarter, which ended Nov. 30. The company said it expected to report earnings of $1.58 a share. The company, which is based in Memphis, is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results on Dec. 18. The results in the last quarter were helped by rapidly falling fuel prices and cost controls, said Alan B. Graf Jr., chief financial officer for FedEx. But demand weakened throughout the quarter and global economic trends were worsening, Mr. Graf said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Bess Greenberg/The New York Times Transcon International has been in the Port Morris section of the Bronx for almost five years. Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Enterprises Incorporated FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » The New York Times Several bridges connect Port Morris with Manhattan. The needle trade businesses had for years been leaving the neighborhood, which was a symbol of urban blight in the 1970s and 1980s, and the building, on Rose Feiss Boulevard just east of Bruckner Boulevard, had at one time been scheduled for demolition by New York City. Now, Transcon, a warehouse and shipping company, occupies four of the building’s six floors  the other tenant is a military uniform manufacturer  and its executives could not be happier with this neighborhood, which seems to have hit its stride. “This is a phenomenal little peninsula of extraordinary abilities,” said Michael Blodget, the chief executive of Transcon, referring to an area that stretches roughly from 149th Street south to the Harlem and East Rivers and the borough’s southern border. Covering about 40 square blocks and encompassing Mott Haven, Port Morris, named after a port created along the East River by Gouverneur Morris, one of the writers of the Constitution, is one of the few industrial areas of the city that are flourishing. Though real estate brokerage firms do not typically keep statistics on the performance of individual industrial neighborhoods, John Reinertsen, a senior vice president at the commercial brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis, said the vacancy rate in Port Morris is about 2 percent. By contrast, the vacancy rate for offices in Manhattan is expected to reach double digits by early 2009. Port Morris “is a very tight market  it’s a tight market for lease, and it’s an even tighter market for sale,” said Mr. Reinertsen, whose company is representing a building being sold by the lighting company Murray Feiss Industries at 125 Rose Feiss Boulevard and 134th Street. Much of that has to do with the loss of industrial space in Brooklyn and Queens to residential conversion, which has driven tenants to the Bronx. Port Morris “is practically the only industrial neighborhood left,” said Lawrence Adler, a broker with the Tamerlain Realty Corporation, a commercial brokerage firm. “It’s the last of the Mohicans.” Part of the area’s appeal is its access to transportation. Neil Pariser, a senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that has renovated factories and apartment buildings in the area, said, “Port Morris has unusually excellent vehicular access for trucks and even good mass transit”  the No. 6 and No. 2 subways. Served by the Triborough Bridge, the Third Avenue Bridge, the Willis Avenue Bridge, the Madison Avenue Bridge and the 145th Street Bridge, along with two railroad bridges, Port Morris is a prime location for distribution into Manhattan. From Port Morris, “trucks get into Manhattan without paying a toll,” said John G. J. Ritter, an executive vice president with the commercial brokerage firm Sholom &amp; Zuckerbrot Realty. That benefits companies like Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., which has a bottling and distribution plant at 977 East 149th Street, and FedEx, which operates a distribution center along the Harlem River south of 132nd Street in the former Harlem River Yards. Port Morris is well-located for shipping heavy products, like paper or lumber, by rail or truck from points north and east, brokers said. The New York Post, for example, opened a printing plant in 2001 at 132nd Street between Rose Feiss Boulevard and Locust Avenue. The area also has small contractors, food providers and other clean industry, and is experiencing a small resurgence of the garment industry, which is being priced out of the fashion district in Manhattan. “Ours is mostly assembly work, with some light fabrication,” Mr. Pariser said. That has made parts of Port Morris, especially Mott Haven, prime candidates for rezoning. In 1997, the city designated part of the area as the Port Morris Special Mixed Use District, enabling it to combine light industrial, commercial and residential properties, instead of being entirely a manufacturing area. The zoning, which allows people to live in the same building where they have a manufacturing business, originally encompassed a five-block area along Bruckner Boulevard. That move was a successful effort to populate abandoned buildings and combat the urban decay in Port Morris. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 19, 2008, on page B8 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/world/middleeast/14iraq.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Cargo Plane With 7 Aboard Crashes in Iraq<date>Published: November 13, 2008</date><text>BAGHDAD  A civilian cargo plane with a crew of seven crashed in western Iraq on Thursday morning, the United States military and a spokeswoman from FedEx said. Early reports suggested that the crew members did not survive, said the FedEx spokeswoman, Sandra Munoz. The Russian-made plane was operated by a Dubai-based firm and was carrying FedEx packages among its cargo. It crashed shortly after taking off from the Al Asad Air Base around 11:35 a.m. en route to Baghdad, said a military spokeswoman, Staff Sgt. Susan James. Though the cause of the crash was still unknown, American military and local officials said the plane had not been shot down. “It appears it was some kind of mechanical failure, that or a pilot failure,” Sergeant James said, adding that no allied forces were on the plane. A police official in the region, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said heavy smoke could be seen coming from the plane before it crashed. “None of the residents of the area said anything about a missile or a rocket hitting the plane,” he said.

Reach of WarGo to Complete Coverage » A blog looking at daily life inside Iraq, produced by The Timess Baghdad bureau. Go to the Blog » Light, portable and easy to lay, sticky bombs are tucked quickly under the bumper of a car or into a chink in a blast wall. Since they are detonated remotely, they rarely harm the person who lays them. And as security in Baghdad has improved, the small and furtive bomb  though less lethal than entire cars or even thick suicide belts packed with explosive  is fast becoming the device of choice for a range of insurgent groups. They are also contributing, in the midst of an uptick in violence, to a growing feeling of unease in the capital. “You take a bit of C4 or some other type of compound,” said Lt. Col. Steven Stover, a spokesman for the United States military in Baghdad. “You can go into a hardware store, take the explosive and combine it with an accelerant, put some glass or marble or bits of metal in front of it and you’ve basically got a homemade Claymore,” a common antipersonnel mine. Sticky bombs are not an Iraqi innovation. “Limpet mines” were attached to the sides of ships during World War II, and magnetic booby traps were used during the conflict in Northern Ireland. Magnetic I.E.D.’s, or improvised explosive devices, were first used in Iraq in late 2004 or early in 2005, according to the American military. But sticky bombs have become steadily more common since the start of this year, from an average of two explosions a week caused by them this spring, to about five per week more recently, Colonel Stover said. According to figures from Iraq’s Interior Ministry, sticky bombs killed 3 people and wounded 18 in Baghdad alone during the month of July. In October, 9 people were killed and 46 more were injured by sticky bombs. Casualty rates caused by sticky bombs are still relatively low. But recent raids on insurgent groups have uncovered caches of the bombs, even “sticky bomb factories,” Colonel Stover said. And magnetic I.E.D.’s have recently been made an explicit part of the training that American soldiers in Baghdad receive. “We make our soldiers aware of the latest threat, and the latest I.E.D. threat is these magnetic I.E.D.’s,” he said. “We put them in their hands and say, ‘Hey, soldier, this is what this thing looks like.’ They’re sometimes used against us  our vehicles are metallic, too.” Iraqi and United States officials acknowledge that “sticky bombs” have been an effective means of spreading terror among Iraqi urban populations but note that, paradoxically, the bombs are also a sign that terrorists are finding it harder to move freely. “The safety barriers, the walls themselves, have largely taken away these catastrophic attacks that you saw in the past,” Colonel Stover said. “The smaller bombs are not capable of causing that catastrophic attack. But they’re causing a lot of panic.” Gen. Jihad al-Jabieri, an explosives expert at the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said that “sticky bombs emerged at the beginning of this year after a clear drop in attacks caused by car bombs, I.E.D.’s and explosive vests.” “Military operations reduced the availability of the explosive materials that were used in car bombs,” General Jabieri said. Sticky bombs have frequently been used to attack Iraqi government and military officials and important businessmen. In July, Faris Amir, the deputy general director of Baghdad’s traffic police, was wounded by a sticky bomb attack. In September, an executive at Al Arabiya, the satellite channel, narrowly survived an assassination attempt by sticky bomb, which destroyed his car. In October, the lawyer Waleed al-Azzawi and the police commander of Diwaniya Province, Omar Abu Atra, were killed in Baghdad by sticky bombs. The media department of Iraq’s Interior Ministry has begun a pamphlet distribution campaign to educate the public about the threat of sticky bombs. . Mohammed Sadoon, a 28-year-old cashier in the coffee shop that his family owns, said that he had been keeping an especially sharp eye on his customers lately. “I noticed that there have been lots of sticky bombs recently, so we watch everyone who enters our shop and we make sure to check the bathrooms and under tables,” Mr. Sadoon said. “My brother always checks underneath our car and looks at any bags that are left inside our shop because we’ve heard from the policemen and soldiers that they always check suspected cars for this small, rapid and high-explosive bomb.” “Let me be frank  if we catch anyone trying to set a sticky bomb in our place, we will beat him very severely before we inform the authorities,” he added. Ahmad Abdul Ellah, also 28 and the owner of a perfume and cosmetics shop, said that he had heard that sticky bombs were usually intended for officials in the Interior Ministry or the Defense Ministry. Still, he takes care to check his car because, “Stuff like this freaks me out and makes me worried.” General Jabieri said that at first “a lot of the sticky bombs came from outside Iraq and local insurgents were trained how to detonate them and attach them to cars. But we’re seeing sticky bombs produced locally in the last couple of months after increasing security measures on the border.” Sticky bombs are usually designed so that they may be detonated by cellphone, General Jabieri said. “They ring the phone when they want to explode the bomb,” he added. “When the sticky bombs started to emerge it was easy to find them because they were usually attached under the fuel tank.” But the bombs are getting steadily smaller, General Jabieri said. Sometimes, he said, they are painted to better match the paint jobs of their victims’ cars. Mohammed Hussein and Atheer Kakan contributed reporting.

Quarterly Profit Falls 9.9 Percent<date>Published: October 23, 2008</date><text>United Parcel Service reported a 9.9 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday and said it expected consumers to cut back on holiday gift purchases. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio United Parcel Service Inc FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » The company is planning cost cuts, including layoffs, in 2009. It said it expected profit for 2008 to be toward the low end of a range it provided in July. “With consumer confidence approaching new lows, we’re concerned that Santa’s sleigh will be lighter this year,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Kuehn said that despite a slowing world economy, the company expected its global export package business to grow 5 percent in the current quarter. Demand for its services fell off sharply toward the end of the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, as the global financial crisis hit. “In September, we saw precipitous declines,” Mr. Kuehn said in the conference call. The results were better than Wall Street had forecast, and analysts attributed that to the decline in fuel prices of the last few months. U.P.S., like its rivals, has imposed surcharges to compensate for soaring diesel and jet fuel prices in recent years. U.P.S. shares rose 3.75 percent, or $1.74, to close at $48.13 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading. I.R.S. Reverses FedEx Ruling The Internal Revenue Service withdrew a preliminary finding that the FedEx Corporation owed back taxes for misclassifying drivers, bolstering the company’s assertion that the workers are contractors and not employees. The I.R.S. is continuing a tax audit of the FedEx Ground unit for the 2002 calendar year, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. The I.R.S. said in December that FedEx owed $319 million in back taxes and penalties for categorizing the ground drivers as contractors in 2002, and that similar issues were under audit for 2004 through 2006. The reversal may help FedEx defend itself in a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Indiana in which drivers are seeking $1 billion in damages. The drivers, who deliver packages through FedEx’s ground network, want to become employees, which would give them better pay and benefits and the ability to unionize. Lynn Rossman Faris, a lawyer who represents more than 20,000 current and former drivers suing FedEx, said it was unclear how the I.R.S. finding would affect the litigation. Fred Smith, FedEx’s founder and chief executive, says the ground drivers are small-business owners who invest in their trucks and are free to hire substitutes or helpers as they expand their routes.

The sweater that your mother is expecting on her birthday, which is tomorrow? City Room happened to witness this particular tow on Sept. 30, but it turns out that it was not unusual. Nor should it be too anxiety-inducing. ''Express delivery trucks, including FedEx, U.P.S. and D.H.L., are towed collectively on the average of one or two per day,'' said Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman for the New York Police Departmentcilhe usual offenses? Blocking traffic lanes or parking in bus stops. And they are not impounded for long. ''They are typically reclaimed in a matter of hours after paying a tow fee of $370 -- twice the $185 fee for towed autos,'' Mr. Browne added. The truck we photographed was out in two hours, said Jim McCluskey, at FedEx media relations in Memphis. A replacement truck had been dispatched immediately to resume the rounds. Mr. McCluskey said FedEx tried to both meet its customers' expectations and be a law-abiding corporate citizen. ''It can be a daily challenge finding a parking space,'' he said, in an understatement with which any New Yorker would agree. In an era of municipal belt-tightening, however, that may not be all for the bad. For the company's fiscal year of June 1, 2007, to May 31, 2008, Mr. McCluskey said, FedEx paid $10.7 million to the City of New York to settle its parking and traffic tickets. DAVID W.

FedEx said it earned $384 million, or $1.23 a share, in the period, compared with $494 million, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the first quarter of FedEx’s fiscal year, rose 8 percent to $9.97 billion from $9.20 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected profit of $1.23 a share on revenue of $9.92 billion. “As FedEx faces today’s especially tough economic challenges, we’ll continue to hold the line on costs across all segments,” the chief executive, Fred Smith said on a conference call. “This includes lowering variable incentive compensation, controlling discretionary spending and limiting staff.” Among the cutbacks, FedEx said it managed flight hours and reduced fuel consumption by about 5 percent in its Express unit during the quarter. Also, the company has “significantly curtailed” its bonus programs and is not adding staff “unless it’s an operational or sales necessity,” the chief financial officer, Alan Graf, said. FedEx said cost-cutting efforts in the quarter were outweighed by global economic weakness and high fuel prices. Growth in its ground and international-domestic express units and from a postal service deal was “substantially offset by a continued decline in U.S. domestic express shipments,” FedEx said. For the second quarter, FedEx expects to earn $1.40 to $1.60 a share, well above Wall Street’s average forecast of $1.35 a share for the period. The company earned $1.54 in the year-ago second quarter. FedEx’s Express unit will raise rates by an average of 6.9 percent, beginning on Jan. 5.

But to corporate America, they are marketing opportunities. More then 170 major corporations -- including Google, Best Buy, Pfizer, FedEx, Allstate, AT&amp;T and Hewlett-Packard -- are spending millions of dollars at the two conventions to promote their brands and their political agendas, creating a trade-show atmosphere away from the podium. General Motors, for example, is providing 700 hybrid and flex-fuel cars as the ''official vehicle provider'' to shuttle politicians around. To show off just how ''flex'' some of these vehicles are, G.M. has teamed with the Molson-Coors Brewing Company to power cars with ''waste beer,'' or beer that is damaged during production and turned into ethanol. Beer and driving usually do not mix. But this unusual combination is part of the automaker's effort to establish its ''green'' bona fides at a time when G.M. and other Detroit automakers are seeking financial support from Congress to build more fuel-efficient vehicles. ''Given the white-hot attention to the conventions,'' said Greg Martin, a G.M. spokesman, ''this is a good chance to showcase our vehicles to a wide range of delegates and opinion leaders whose influence extends beyond Washington and their communities.'' AT&amp;T set up in the parking lot of the Pepsi Center in Denver to give conventiongoers a chance to try out the new iPhone. Coca-Cola was handing out Dasani water to people standing in security lines at Invesco Field. Union Pacific has a new hybrid locomotive on display, part of a 30-car fleet it is using for parties at both conventions. A Minneapolis company that makes a fire retardant called FoamPro will have six fire trucks emblazoned with an elephant logo at the Republican convention. ''For companies, conventions are an attractive place to be,'' said Giovanna Torchio, director of business development at Jack Morton Worldwide, a marketing agency. ''You have a concentrated group that have multiple roles and share a passion.'' Major corporations help bankroll the conventions, too. A total of $112 million in private money was raised through the sale of sponsorships by host committees at both conventions to finance them. This compares to $16 million in federal money available to each venue to cover convention costs. (Each venue receives an additional $50 million in federal antiterrorist money, but it is earmarked to pay for security.) Donations to the host committees are tax deductible, and they come with a promise of political access that is harder to come by under new ethics rules passed by Congress last year. Corporations are banned from making direct political contributions, but they can write six- and seven-figure checks and receive V.I.P. credentials to the convention floor, invitations to private events with members of Congress, and space to set up logo-plastered booths at convention events. (They can even put their logo on key cards at the hotels where delegates are staying.) The companies also see the conventions as good networking opportunities with other businesses, and a chance to provide story fodder to the 15,000 members of the news media. Most companies at the conventions are already skilled Washington hands. A report from the Campaign Finance Institute, a Washington nonprofit organization that studies money and politics, found that the 173 donors to the host committees -- mostly corporations but also several trade unions -- have contributed $180 million to federal candidates and spent $1.3 billion in lobbying federal officials since 2005. At both conventions, the biggest corporate presence is Qwest, which has donated $6 million in telecommunications services to each host committee and is the ''official telecommunications provider.'' The company's chief executive, Edward A. Mueller, hosted an invitation-only reception at the Denver Art Museum.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/sports/golf/20course.html?ref=fedexcorporation">A Classic Woodland Course, and a Long One at That<date>Published: August 19, 2008</date><text>THERE is one unavoidable feature of the venerable Ridgewood Country Club, inescapable to golfers regardless of season, handicap or preferred ball flight. It is the thousands of stately, giant trees that line the fairways and occasionally guard the greens. Those trees are one reason that Ridgewood is known as a classic, traditional golf course; its challenges await in the contours of the land and a host of arching branches and hardwood tree trunks. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Sampling the Courses PGA Tour Leader Board Results and Schedule Statistics Money Leaders More Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European 2008 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open (July 17-20) P.G.A. Championship (August 7-10) And to think that many of Ridgewood’s trees have been trimmed over the years to keep play fair. “Trees don’t just grow up, they grow out,” said David Reasoner, the Ridgewood head professional. “It’s why people talk about the massiveness of our trees, but we have cut back hundreds of them.” The pruning lets a second feature of Ridgewood shine through: its twisting, sloping fairways. Altogether, at the 2008 Barclays Golf Tournament, the Ridgewood Country Club will present a time-honored, man-against-nature test for the modern, technologically advanced PGA Tour player. In terms of its length and diversity, the Ridgewood course that the tour pros will face at the Barclays, the first stop of the FedEx Cup playoffs, will be the most difficult layout the club has put together in its more than 70 years of top championship play. What Ridgewood calls its championship course is a composite of 18 holes compiled from the best of the 27 holes at the club. When Ridgewood was the host of the Senior P.G.A. Championship in 2001, this composite course was approximately 7,000 yards long. The 2008 Barclays will be 7,320 yards, and some holes have been converted to par 4s from par 5s, bringing the overall course par to 71. Making the course play even longer will be the Northeast climate. Many PGA tournaments are played in dry climates where players can hit 290-yard drives that roll another 40 yards on hard fairways. At Ridgewood, distance will be harder earned. “Phil Mickelson came here for a practice round not too long ago, and the first thing he said after he finished was, ‘Boy, that’s a long course,’ ” Reasoner said. But Ridgewood is more than lengthy. It has variety, from a 155-yard par 3 to a 626-yard par 5. True to the tradition of designer A. W. Tillinghast, there are shorter, risk-and-reward par-4 holes and clever, strategic par 5s. As on many Tillinghast layouts, it’s an advantage to hit the ball right to left. It is a shotmaker’s course; the rough near all those trees is punishing, and recoveries from the dense woods are likely to be difficult. “It’s a good mix of holes, and it takes a variety of skills to play them well,” Reasoner said. “But it’s all there in front of the player. There aren’t gimmicks. You see the test at hand.” Take the 291-yard par-4 fifth hole, where many pros will be tempted to go for the green off the tee. Not a hard shot distance-wise for the accomplished player, except the green is, in Reasoner’s words, “ridiculously tiny.” Six deep, deadly bunkers surround the plateaued, narrow green. So while birdie might be in the thoughts of most players on the tee, a bogey is also a possibility. Another hole that would seem ripe for many birdies is the shortish, 412-yard par-4 14th hole. But the 14th might feature the hardest second shot on the course. Positioning the drive off the tee will be difficult on this right-to-left dogleg because of a cross bunker jutting well into the center of the fairway near the optimal landing area. The green is elevated strikingly and has three tiers, all with a severe back-to-front slope that spits many an approach shot back into the fairway in front of the green. Besides, by the time the players get to the 14th hole they will be worn out from playing the previous two holes. The 475-yard 12th hole is a par 4 converted from a par 5. It is not only long, but mostly uphill. The rough on each side of the fairway will make it nearly impossible to reach another elevated green if the tee shot is wayward. The 13th hole is a genuine three-shot-to-the-green par 5, at 626 yards, with a second shot over an 80-yard mid-hole expanse of mounds and 10-inch-high wild grasses. Adding to the difficulty of the second shot is the angle of the fairway, which twists left to right. Players making two lengthy, precision shots still have to safely find another understated, tricky and fast green. Like all storied old courses, Ridgewood also has quality closing holes. The par-5 17th is shaped like an “S” and requires a second shot to navigate past a giant tulip tree protecting the right side of the fairway. This hole has decided many a match and championship, including the 1990 Senior United States Open when Jack Nicklaus missed a key approach shot, allowing Lee Trevino to claim victory. The 18th hole is also known for its left-to-right dogleg through another corridor of mighty oak trees  a classic finishing hole. “I think the players will like the course, and I’m pleased that those who have come to play practice rounds seem to know the history here,” Reasoner said. “When you look around at all the old trees and traditional clubhouse, that old-time feel sets in.” Another benefit for fans attending the 2008 Barclays, Reasoner said, will be the open space the layout provides in the middle of the championship course. Because four of the nine holes known as the Center Course will not be used during the tournament, they provide an unoccupied expanse in the middle of the property. “It should be easy for spectators to get around,” Reasoner said. “It may not be flat, but it’s very walkable. It is spread out, so the people should get to see a lot of golf.” And there will be no shortage of shady places to rest. Not with all those big, old trees.

The road to victory in the FedEx Cup is not quite so clear-cut. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic The Leaders Momentum PGA Tour Leader Board Results and Schedule Statistics Money Leaders More Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European 2008 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open (July 17-20) P.G.A. Championship (August 7-10) In theory, the winner should be the player who has finished in the top 10 for the regular season, then performs well most consistently during the cup’s four tournaments. If a top-10 player finished second in each event, he would have a 99 percent chance of winning  but no player except Tiger Woods has shown he can get four top-10 finishes in a row. So, in practice, winning at least one of the four tournaments is crucial. For instance, if Kenny Perry, the top-ranked player going into the first tournament, won one event, his chance of winning the cup would jump to about 50 percent, depending on whether another top-10 player, like Phil Mickelson, also won one of the tournaments. If a player like Perry or Mickelson won two of the tournaments, he would be virtually assured of winning the cup. A first-place finish in each of the first three tournaments is worth 11,000 points, while second place receives 7,400 and third place 5,400; in the final tournament, the awards are 12,500, 8,500 and 6,000 points, respectively. So the FedEx Cup is partly about playing at a consistently high level and partly about reaching the highest level once or twice. Neither is a given for most players, because golf performance is so streaky (unless you are Woods, whose streaks seem to last forever). With Woods recuperating from knee surgery, who might be likely to hoist the cup a month from now? Who might combine consistent performance and a high likelihood of winning one or two of the tournaments? As the chart above makes clear, the players most likely to have at least two top-10 finishes and at least one win during a four-tournament stretch are Padraig Harrington, Mickelson and Stewart Cink. The average PGA Tour player earns 80 percent of his prize money in about 35 percent of the tournaments he plays, when motion, timing and temperament mesh to yield multiple consecutive scores under par. So what we really want to know is this: How many consecutive weeks are players able to maintain winning scores, and how often can they have such streaks? The chart shows in how many tournaments the top 10 FedEx Cup players typically maintain scoring streaks and how often these streaks occur. I’ll define a scoring streak as eight under par for the tournament, after adjustments for course difficulty. Eight under will usually guarantee a top-10 finish. Statistical analysis shows that the average scoring streak lasts only 1.2 tournaments, though top players (Woods is again the exception) can occasionally extend it to three tournaments. Most players seem to have a limit on how many consecutive low rounds they can post, so the Ryder Cup could have a large impact on the FedEx Cup series, as it occurs just before the final event, the Tour Championship. Top players tend to have a cycle to their streaks, and players who perform well at the Ryder Cup are less likely to perform well at the Tour Championship. For example, Vijay Singh and Mickelson were overdue for streaks heading into the W.G.C.-Bridgestone Invitational, which began July 31, and they finished first and fourth. Perry, Anthony Kim and Harrington were overdone  that is, their streaks had already extended the expected amount of time, and they were due for a small slump. Each finished out of the top 10, with Perry, the hottest player on Tour in July, finishing 66th. Harrington was due for a rebound the following week at the P.G.A. Championship, and he indeed won again. Sergio Garcia finished second, after a two-tournament slump. Harrington and Garcia will play for Europe in the Ryder Cup; Mickelson, Cink, Perry and Kim have been named to the American team. Let’s see if the Ryder Cup winners go to the Tour Championship with a winning hangover. Mark Sweeney does statistical analysis for some PGA Tour players.

The points system virtually mirrored the money list. And the money-list leader had changed just once since the turn of the century. Tiger Woods, could essentially sit out almost the entire postseason and still win the Cup while seated on his couch. So why not just yield to inevitability and hand him the $10 million bonus?

Championship (August 7-10) S. Greenwood/Getty Images NOT THIS TIME Tiger Woods won the FedEx Cup in 2007 but is out of action this year. As the second playing of the FedEx Cup gets under way this week with the Barclays at Ridgewood Country Club, these refrains are seldom heard. The absence of Woods because of his season-ending knee surgery in June and some adjustments in the points system have made the identity of the FedEx Cup champion no longer a foregone conclusion. “It is wide open,” said Steve Stricker, the winner of the Barclays last year, when it was played at the Westchester Country Club. “Last year I thought, you know, it was good, it was good TV what we had going. As the FedExCup wore on, there were a lot of good story lines there, too.” Sure there were, and Stricker’s resurgence was among the best of them. But he hit on the reason why this year the FedEx Cup has many more possibilities for good TV and excitement, even as the opening of the N.F.L. season looms and the specter of Woods  perhaps larger in his absence  hovers over it all. Wide open. That is the story line this year, as obvious as it is compelling, and it is not born of puffery or hyperbole. Consider that Woods still leads the FedEx list by 500 points over the likable and unlikely de facto leader, Kenny Perry; by 750 over Phil Mickelson, who must be considered the favorite to win it all; and by 1,000 over Padraig Harrington, currently the hottest player on the planet. Any of these three will blow Woods off the leader board just by making the cut  and collecting 2,100 points for 70th place  at the Barclays. Many others could do the same. That Woods is still the elephant in the room is a reflection of how dominant he was at the beginning the season, when he won four times in six PGA Tour starts, including his first three and his last one  the astounding 14-hole playoff victory over Rocco Mediate at the United States Open. It is never a good thing, however temporary, to lose the biggest draw in golf, the most recognizable single figure in sports and arguably the best golfer in history. But as Woods often says, it is what it is. And competitive natures being what they are, Tour players know an opening when they see one. “You know what,” Perry said, “with Tiger out, you know, it’s just a great opportunity for an old guy here to actually steal some money in that FedEx Cup. So that’s what we’re after now.” They do not award a green jacket to the FedEx Cup champion, but a massive amount of green is on the line, starting with a $7 million purse at each of the four tournaments  the Barclays; the Deutsche Bank Championship Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 at the T.P.C. Boston, in Norton, Mass.; the BMW Championship Sept. 4 to 7 at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis; and the Tour Championship Sept. 25 to 28 at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. The fields competing for all that cash shrink each week, from 144 at the Barclays  though eight of those eligible are not competing, leaving a field of 136  to 120 at the Deutsche Bank, to 70 at the BMW, to 30 at the Tour Championship. Because this is a year of the Ryder Cup year, the Tour designated Sept. 8 to 14 as a week off before it. This break will give players a chance to recharge before the Ryder Cup and also to stay sharp for the FedEx Cup final. Mickelson, among those last year who believed that the schedule needed these adjustments, is fired up. “All these events are just huge finishing the year, and I’m excited,” he said. “It comes at a perfect time, the Ryder Cup does, now that it’s in the middle of the FedEx Cup season, because everybody is at their sharpest. Everybody is playing hard to finish the year strong, playing their best.” If everything falls into place, this could be the type of excitement the PGA Tour envisioned when it created the FedEx Cup. The emergence of Harrington, with his wins at the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship, certainly has not hurt the international appeal. And he has jumped right into the promotional fray. “It provides new life, really, this playoff system,” Harrington said. “Once everybody gets readjusted with points at the start of the Barclays, if you’re up near 20th, 30th, you’ve got a legitimate chance of winning this thing. So that provides a lot of excitement and gives renewed life when you come to a tournament at the start of the playoffs. “You know there is a lot riding on the line, and depending where you are on the point list, that could vary from one player to the next.” That is not an overstatement. There are situations, some quite plausible, whereby certain less-known golfers who emerged during the year as compelling crowd favorites could actually wind up in the hunt for the $10 million cash bonus  $9 million of which will go directly to the winner with $1 million deferred. Mediate, currently No. 60, can draw some hope from what happened at the Wyndham Championship last Sunday. Carl Pettersson moved up 45 positions in the standings to No. 13, from No. 58, with his victory. Five players used their performance at the Wyndham to gain entry into the Barclays field: Rich Beem (No. 114, from No. 166), Martin Laird (No. 128, from No. 164), J. J. Henry (No. 135, from No. 177), Justin Bolli (No. 141, from No. 153) and Lee Janzen (No. 144, from No. 154). To get into the field, Janzen one-putted the final three holes at the Wyndham for a 2-3-4 finish and a closing-round 67. A two-time United States Open winner, who has yet to secure his Tour card for 2009, Janzen now has a good chance to earn his way into the top 125 from his current position of 151st on the money list. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 26, 2008 A picture caption in the Guide to the Cup section on Wednesday with the cover article about the competition in this year’s FedEx Cup golf playoffs misstated the given name of a player shown who was considered among the contenders.

They carve out new divisions to make more teams eligible, create wild-card entries, add extra rounds and stretch best-of-five series to four-of-sevens. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Tim Sloan/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images BIG POINT SHIFT Had the new points system been in place last year, Rich Beem would have been among the top 70 FedEx Cup finishers, rather than being 134th. Multimedia PGA Tour Leader Board Results and Schedule Statistics Money Leaders More Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European 2008 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open (July 17-20) P.G.A. Championship (August 7-10) Now in the second season of its playoff, the PGA Tour is tinkering, too. Last year, the Tour initiated a four-tournament sprint leading up to the FedEx Cup, for which points are earned weekly during the Tour’s regular season. The Tour declared the four-tournament playoff a success, even if none of the four events are majors, because by uniting the previously unrelated tournaments, the playoff provided some late-season oomph. “We wanted to have the top players going head-to-head four weeks in a row; identify a true, season-long champion; and bring an exciting conclusion to the season,” said Steve Dennis, the PGA Tour’s senior director of communications strategy. The first cup was won by Tiger Woods, who skipped the Barclays (the first of the four tournaments), was held off by Phil Mickelson at the Deutsche Bank Championship, then won the last two, the BMW Championship and the Tour Championship, to earn the $10 million prize. This year, with input from players, management, news media and fans, the Tour tinkered with the format, tweaking the points system to create more volatility in the field as it narrows from the 144 eligible at the Barclays (though only 136 will compete) to 120 at the Deutsche to 70 at the BMW to 30 at the finale. Under last year’s points system, only two players, Doug LaBelle and Rich Beem, moved into the top 120 in the standings and played in the Deutsche tournament based on their finishes in the Barclays. The next week, just John Mallinger and Bo Van Pelt did well enough in the Deutsche to squeeze into the top 70 and earn spots in the BMW. Had the new structure been in place last year, Dennis said, 11 players would have moved high enough in the standings to move from the Barclays to the Deutsche, and 17 would have been able to move into the BMW from the Deutsche. And Beem, who was in 134th place before the Barclays, would have been among the top 70 to make it into the BMW. Now, when it resets the standings before the Barclays, the Tour will narrow the gap between the players, so that, for example, the top player will start with 100,000 points and the next player begins the playoff at 99,500, not 99,000 as he did last year. Second, everyone who finishes in the money will get 2,000 extra points, so that the 30th-place finisher at the Barclays who last year earned 340 points will now get 2,340. Taken separately, Dennis said, each change doesn’t greatly alter the volatility. “But when combined, more people will move in and out of the cut lines, and it will make more people have a chance at making the Tour Championship,” he said. The Tour’s changes are similar in spirit to those that Nascar made last year to its 10-race, end-of-the-season cup playoff. Nascar raised the number of qualified drivers to 12 from 10, reset their point totals to 5,000 after the 26th race of the season and gave each driver a 10-point bonus for each race victory. “That sport is willing to tweak a lot of things,” Dennis said. “We’re a little stodgier, but still, in Year 1, we were perfectly willing to fool around with our format.” Zach Johnson, who finished tied for second, eight strokes behind Woods at the Tour Championship, said the changes added “a little more drama and a little more splash.” Are they enough to ensure the volatility players lobbied for? “It’s too early to tell,” he said, but added that the playoff helps golf appeal to viewers at a time when it competes with baseball, Nascar and the opening of the college and professional football seasons. The playoff will face three obstacles that it didn’t have last year. The Ryder Cup team competition among the best players from the United States and Europe will take place between the third playoff event and the final Tour Championship, creating a three-week gap that might diminish fan interest and slow the momentum of the leading players. Another blow to fan interest might be Woods’s season-ending reconstructive knee surgery. And high energy prices might dampen attendance. Dennis took an optimistic stand about the Woods-free playoff. “As we start the playoff, the story will be Tiger’s not playing, and who will emerge,” he said. “And after they tee off at the Barclays, the story will be who’s moving up, who missed the cut and who had a significant drop, and I think Tiger in many respects is going to be a footnote.” Woods is almost never a footnote even in absentia, and Johnson is chagrined that he will not be playing against him. “I think most of us would agree that we want Tiger to play,” he said. “He makes us better and makes us step up our game. It’s a bummer that he’s not playing right now, but there will be other stories.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on August 20, 2008, on page SPG2 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/sports/golf/20fans.html?ref=fedexcorporation">$10 Million Plot, 136 Characters<date>Published: August 19, 2008</date><text>WHILE this is the second year of the FedEx Cup, there is still confusion about how the playoff system works.

Championship (August 7-10) Enlarge This Image Andrew Gombert/European Pressphoto Agency UP SCOPE At the U.S. Open in June, fans used periscopes to follow the action. Here’s a FedEx Cup introduction, with all the questions and answers you need to join in the fun. Q. Tiger Woods has already won the FedEx Cup, right? A. Woods is among the regular-season FedEx Cup points leaders, even though he hasn’t played in two months because he is rehabilitating his surgically repaired knee. But he will not play in the four weeks of FedEx Cup playoff events and therefore cannot win. He did win last year. Q. Can I qualify for the FedEx Cup playoffs if I get my company to use FedEx for all its shipments? A. Only if you are a member of the PGA Tour and have had a good enough year to be among the top 144 players in the 2008 FedEx Cup standings. FedEx Cup points have been awarded since the start of the golf season in January, based on how players finished in dozens of PGA Tour events (a first-place finish was worth 4,500 points). The top 144 point-getters qualify for the first of four Tour events, also designated as FedEx Cup playoff tournaments, beginning with the Barclays Golf Tournament, which starts tomorrow and ends on Aug. 24. (Of those 144, eight decided not to participate.) Q. If it’s just a season-long points race, why don’t they just give the championship to the PGA Tour money list leader at the end of the year? A. Because, beginning with the Barclays tournament, the point totals are reset, and what follows is a separate four-event competition. You have to play well enough all year to get into a good position in the FedEx Cup standings, and then you have to beat your competition in the last four events. Q. So the season-long points don’t count once the four-event FedEx Cup playoffs start? A. Yes and no. The actual point totals don’t count, but players are seeded based on how many points they have accumulated since January. The top-seeded player will be awarded 100,000 points as the FedEx Cup playoffs start at the Barclays. The second-ranked player will get 99,500. The 10th player will get 98,125 points and the 30th player 96,630 points, with a declining number of points on down to the spot held by the 144th-ranked player. The players then compete to be the leader after all four playoff events, with the top-seeded players trying to maintain their advantage and the players below them trying to climb the point standings. Q. How do they get more points? A. Points are awarded for winning a tournament or finishing near the leaders, except that in the playoffs the point values are much higher: 11,000 points for a first-place finish at the Barclays, for example. Q. Can a player convert airline frequent-flier miles into FedEx Cup points to upgrade his place in the standings? A. No, and a certificate for a free drink at Applebee’s gets you nowhere, as well. Q. O.K., so who are the favorites to win the FedEx Cup playoffs? A. That depends on who gets hot in the final four events. A lot of ground can be made up quickly with less than 4,000 points separating the top-ranked player from the 30th-ranked player. Even the 144th player is within 8,000 points. Q. So it’s just a big, happy free-for-all for four weeks? A. Actually, no. The FedEx Cup playoffs are golf’s version of a demolition derby. Every week a sizable group of players are driven from the playoffs  eliminated, purged, banished to the sidelines with a busted, fuming radiator. Q. You’re referring to the cut, which happens every week on the PGA Tour, right? A. No. While there will be the usual trimming of the field  a cut  after two rounds of play in the early playoff events, there will also be eliminations each week. At the conclusion of each of the first three FedEx Cup playoff events, the number of players invited to the next FedEx playoff tournament will be reduced. After the Barclays, the new FedEx Cup standings will be tabulated and the bottom 24 players will be shown the door. So only 120 players will head to the next event: the Deutsche Bank Championship, outside Boston. After that event, another 50 players are sent off, whittling the remaining contenders to 70. The third tournament is the BMW Championship in St. Louis, after which only 30 players will advance to the final FedEx Cup playoff event, the Tour Championship in Atlanta. Q. So, obviously, players have to keep an eye on their place in the standings? A. Like there’s a pack of maniacal demolition derby drivers sizing them up. Q. What’s the payout for winning the FedEx Cup playoffs anyway? What’s the champion get? A. A very cool sterling silver trophy. Oh, and $10 million. Q. Ten million dollars? A. It’s referred to as the biggest single bonus payout in sports. Q. Isn’t the Ryder Cup late this summer? Won’t that get in the way? A. After the BMW Championships, the FedEx Cup chase will take a break for the Ryder Cup. Then, the Tour Championship will crown the FedEx Cup champion. Mark your calendar, Sept. 28. Q. Last question: Can’t Tiger come out of rehab and win anyway? He hasn’t needed two legs before to win a major championship, right? A. Woods has said his golf season is over until next year. But if I were Phil Mickelson, Kenny Perry, Padraig Harrington or any of the other top players, I would order security to stop anyone at the main gate wearing a bright red golf shirt.

Smith has been celebrated as one of the smartest minds in business. So why, at a time when American investors are avoiding Hollywood, does he keep pouring millions into movies? Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Mike Mergen for The New York Times Movie makers Andrew Kosove, left, and Broderick Johnson. Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » Mr. Smith, who continues to serve as chief executive of FedEx, recently agreed to be the equity partner  the riskiest position in movie financing arrangements, as the last to be paid  in a $550 million, 15-movie deal with Alcon Entertainment. The small production company, which has a long-term distribution deal with Warner Brothers, is supposed to deliver the films over the next five years. “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2,” a follow-up to the modestly successful tear-jerker about four girlfriends, will be the first movie under the financing accord. Warner Brothers will release the film on Aug. 6. “I sure hope it’s a success,” Mr. Smith said in a rare interview discussing his entertainment investment strategy. “It’s impossible to predict.” That impossibility is one reason studios are suddenly having a hard time wooing investors. In recent months, Wall Street’s mortgage mess, tight credit markets and the sour economy have combined to slow the torrent of private money flowing into the movie capital. In such volatile financial times, even the most carefree pockets are seeking safety, and that’s not Hollywood. But Mr. Smith said he believed that Alcon, founded in 1997 with his backing, had figured out how to minimize risk and maximize return. For starters, the company operates on a threadbare budget. The two founders, Broderick Johnson and Andrew A. Kosove, share a cramped office in a nontrendy part of Los Angeles. They keep development costs low by not taking on projects that do not already have a script and, in many cases, a filmmaker attached. Mr. Smith said the biggest mistake a movie investor can make is sampling the stardust. “Squandering money on overly ambitious vanity projects, trying to be part of a scene, rubbing elbows with fancy stars  that’s how you lose money,” he said. How does Alcon inoculate itself from show business excess? “The two of us are both in the boat together rowing, and if one is going the wrong direction, he doesn’t get very far,” Mr. Johnson offered. Mr. Kosove said: “That only happens if you get a ton of success very early on. We feel lucky in some ways that our first film was a total flop,” referring to “Lost &amp; Found,” with David Spade. Alcon, named after a mythical archer, also keeps budgets small: the pictures it pursues typically range in price from $15 million to $50 million, although the company allows for budgets of up to $75 million. “That way the relative equity risk per picture is relatively small,” Mr. Smith said, “and you get a lot of times at bat, which is important because there is no way you can predict what consumers will respond to. You don’t get wiped off the planet if any one project fails.” Unlike many producers, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Kosove, who met as undergraduates at Princeton University, do not aspire to create art. One of their biggest hits, the sophomoric Ashton Kutcher comedy “Dude, Where’s My Car?,” was made for $13 million and sold more than $73 million in tickets worldwide. “Alcon would obviously love to win an Academy Award, but the point of the movie business is to make money,” Mr. Smith said. “If you please the critics or the cognoscenti along the way, all the better.” That approach is just fine by Warner Brothers, said Alan F. Horn, president and chief operating officer of the studio. “Alcon makes a kind of quality picture that works very well for us,” he said in an interview. “These guys are not afraid to go for movies aimed at an older female audience, and that’s a nice balance to our internal focus, which is to develop big event movies.” Mr. Johnson, 41, and Mr. Kosove, 38, met Mr. Smith through an acquaintance and presented him a 222-page business plan. But it was something else that prompted him to start writing checks. When the partners got an opportunity to meet with Mr. Smith in the mid-1990s, the two men could not afford plane tickets to Tennessee, where FedEx is based. Mr. Kosove remembered that he had two unused tickets on United Airlines, but both were in his name. So the pair masqueraded as father and son  no simple feat, since Mr. Kosove is 5 feet, 6 inches tall and white, Mr. Johnson is 6-foot-3 and black. “I figured that any two guys who had the salesmanship to do that were a pretty impressive pair,” Mr. Smith said. It was Mr. Smith, the two Alcon founders say, who saw potential in “My Dog Skip.” The 2000 film, about a shy boy growing up with his mutt, was made for $6 million and was headed straight to video until Mr. Smith intervened. It got a chance in theaters, where it sold about $36 million in tickets. For now, attention is focused on “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.” The movie strikes many industry analysts as a hit. Based on the best-selling books by Ann Brashares, the movie stars a quartet of popular television actresses: America Ferrera (“Ugly Betty”), Amber Tamblyn (“Joan of Arcadia”), Alexis Bledel (“Gilmore Girls”) and Blake Lively (“Gossip Girl.”) “I’m really proud of what Alcon has accomplished so far,” Mr. Smith said. A graduate of Yale, he added: “It obviously pains me greatly to say that about two Princeton guys.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/business/19fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">After Loss, FedEx Issues a Cautious Forecast<date>Published: June 19, 2008</date><text>MEMPHIS (AP)  FedEx, the international package delivery company, reported a fourth-quarter loss Wednesday and offered a gloomy outlook as it wrestled with a slumping American economy and soaring fuel costs. FedEx predicted 2009 earnings of $4.75 to $5.25 a share, well below Wall Street expectations of $5.92 a share. The company expects to earn 80 cents to $1 a share in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Analysts had forecast $1.27 a share. In the fourth quarter, which just ended, FedEx lost 78 cents a share, or $241 million, in contrast to a profit of $610 million, or $1.96 a share, for the same quarter last year. Excluding one-time charges, FedEx earned $1.45 a share for the quarter. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $9.87 billion, from $9.15 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had expected $1.47 a share on revenue of $9.6 billion. FedEx, which owns the world’s largest cargo airline, spent almost $1.4 billion on fuel in the fourth quarter, and those costs represented 14 percent of total operating expenses, said Dan Ortwerth, an analyst for Edward Jones. FedEx customers pay fuel surcharges, but those do not cover all of the increases. The company spent 54 percent more on fuel than it did for the same quarter last year, Mr. Ortwerth said, while the surcharges were up less than 30 percent. “They don’t try to recover the entire increase in fuel because that would really hurt the customer and they have the sense to invest in long-term customer relations,” he said. Higher fuel costs, however, mean higher prices for FedEx services. “The prices have gotten high enough that people are looking for other ways to ship their goods,” said a Morgan Keegan analyst, Art Hatfield. And even customers who stay with FedEx may shift from express shipments to less expensive, slower services, he said. The fuel surcharges, which are added to the company’s basic shipping rates, were 28 percent for June and will increase to 32.5 percent in July, Mr. Hatfield said. FedEx’s chairman, Frederick W. Smith, said FedEx was confident it could deal with the economy’s troubles by holding down expenses, limiting capital spending and expanding the company’s international business. “It’s my opinion that great companies always improve their competitive positions in economic downturns,” Mr. Smith said, “and we intend to do just that.” FedEx said it would continue capital spending on overseas expansion, “significant investments” in more fuel-efficient aircraft and other projects related to its long-range strategies. FedEx said its outlook for the new fiscal year “assumes no additional increases to current fuel prices and no further weakening in the economy.” The fourth-quarter earnings included a one-time charge of $891 million for the expected costs of renaming the company’s office service and copying division from FedEx Kinko’s to FedEx Office. FedEx shares fell $1.73, or 2.1 percent, to $82.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company, based in Memphis, said it would report a one-time noncash impairment charge of $891 million in its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31, including $515 million for the FedEx Kinko’s trade name and $367 million related to good will, the company said. After taxes, the charge will be $696 million, or $2.22 a share. The charge was not included in FedEx’s announcement on May 9 that it was lowering its fourth-quarter earnings outlook to $1.45 to $1.50 a share, from $1.60 to $1.80.

Thomson Financial says analysts expect, on average, a profit of $1.69 a share. FedEx says its fuel costs have risen by more than 7 percent since it issued its previous guidance in March. In addition, weak economic conditions have resulted in lower demand for shipping and freight services, the company says. “While we have dynamic fuel surcharges in place, they cannot keep pace in the short term with rapidly rising fuel prices,” Alan B.

In May 2003, when gasoline was $1.50 a gallon, FedEx was predicting that it would have 30,000 hybrids on the road in a few years. But today, all companies together have only about 300. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Hybrid Vehicles On paper, commercial vehicles, not private cars, should be the “killer app” for hybrid technology. Delivery trucks operate in stop-and-go traffic, where hybrids excel. Commercial vehicles drive many more hours a day than family cars do, going many more miles in a year and using more fuel for each mile, thus multiplying the opportunities for saving fuel. And with gasoline at about $3.50 a gallon, and diesel around $4, the shift to hybrids should go faster. FedEx said in 2003 that it was buying 20 hybrid delivery trucks, but David J. Bronczek, chief executive of the company’s FedEx Express unit, said at the time, “I can’t envision any reason why we wouldn’t roll this out over the whole fleet.” Today, the company has about 100 but says it hopes to have dozens more by the end of the year. U.P.S., which has been experimenting with alternative-fuel vehicles for decades, is using about 50 gasoline-electric hybrids and has tried two hydraulic hybrids, which store energy in the form of oil in a pressure tank instead of electricity in a battery. It plans to try eight more hydraulic hybrids, but is moving deliberately. “We need to justify them to all our stakeholders, our customers, our investors and our employees,” said Michael R. Hance, vice president for automotive engineering and operations. Production volumes are small, so there are few economies of scale, the manufacturers and customers say. So the price premium for a hybrid is still very large. “We need to get production up to several thousand a year to get the nice breaks in price structure,” said Kevin Beaty, manager of hybrid power systems at the Eaton Corporation, a major producer of hybrid delivery trucks and other medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The company declined to provide production figures. One result, he said, is that a delivery truck that costs $40,000 as an ordinary diesel will sell for $70,000 as a hybrid. There is progress, though: U.P.S. said its early hybrids cost double what an ordinary vehicle did, but the premium is now just 50 percent. In contrast, when Toyota introduced the Prius, it began with a production run in the thousands per year and is now in the hundreds of thousands. But for trucks, “we’re talking about an emerging technology,” said Dimitri Kazarinoff, a manager of new technologies at Eaton. And there is another reason: consumers may buy a Prius or other hybrid because it is cool to own one, but businesses sharpen their pencils better when it comes to calculating the payback time. For example, a 10,000-pound walk-in FedEx delivery truck called the W700 carries 6,000 pounds of packages. The company has dozens of these trucks that are hybrids. A consumer shopping for a car might be drawn by “the chicness of the Prius,” said Mitch Jackson, environmental director at the company. But when it comes to chic, “We never looked at the W700 in that light.” Mr. Jackson said the company planned to replace standard trucks with hybrids if it were economically feasible. But even with $3 gasoline, the payback period is 20 years, he said. Hybrids may be irresistible in some special cases, experts said. For example, Florida Power and Light is using what it calls a hybrid bucket truck. In a conventional bucket truck, the lineman keeps the truck’s gas or diesel engine running while parked on the job just to power the bucket. In the hybrid version, the power comes from batteries charged while the truck is moving. And the range of hybrids in commercial use may eventually be much wider than those in light-duty vehicles like cars and S.U.V.’s. Eaton, for example, is working on another innovation, a purely hydraulic hybrid, for use in garbage trucks. These would capture the energy that is ordinarily lost when the truck stops for a curbside pickup, and gives it back through a hydraulic pump in a “launch assist,” to get the truck moving to the next house. It has no batteries and no special electrical system. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: May 25, 2008 An article on April 27 about commercial applications for hybrid vehicles described a bucket truck used by Florida Power and Light incorrectly. While the truck’s hybrid system can indeed power the bucket, it can also power the drive wheels.

There is no more important corporate value at FedEx Ground than how we treat people including employees, contractors, customers and the communities we serve. We are sympathetic to the very difficult situation of the contractor in the article. As an independent business owner, she had several options that she had exercised in the past, including hiring employees to manage her business, as was mentioned in the article, or selling her route and equipment to others. Many millions of independent contractors across the United States have chosen to work for themselves. And while a very small number of former and current contractors, including the one described in the article, have decided to actively join litigation, tens of thousands of independent contractors have had a positive business relationship with FedEx Ground. The company proudly supports their efforts to build and grow their own businesses as 15,000 FedEx Ground independent contractors deliver over 3.5 million packages on average every day. Should the contractor in the article have an opportunity to rejoin the FedEx Ground network, we would encourage her to pursue it. Maury S.

She first contracted the disease three years earlier and suffered through seven months of chemotherapy. After her cancer came back, her husband walked out on her. “He told me he wasn’t sexually attracted to me anymore,” she said.

For more than a decade, Jean and her husband had been a truck-driving team, driving hazardous waste. Now, with husband and truck gone, her career as a long-haul driver was gone as well. After she recovered, Jean started looking for work. She spotted a help-wanted ad from Roadway Package Systems, which said it was looking for independent contractors to deliver packages. “I needed a job,” said Jean. “They tell you, ‘You’ll make all this money working for yourself.’ ” She soon discovered that her new employer had embraced a controversial strategy to squeeze down costs by millions of dollars each year: it insisted that Jean and the other drivers were independent contractors, not employees. The I.R.S., New York and many other states are investigating this strategy, convinced that many companies use it to cheat their workers and cheat on taxes. Jean arrived at the Roadway terminal in Brockton, Mass., at 6 each morning and spent the next 90 minutes loading 100 to 140 packages into her truck. She usually left the terminal around 7:30 a.m. and returned after 6 p.m. Jean had to leave her job for two years when she suffered a severe back injury while lifting a package. Before she could return to work, FedEx Ground, which had acquired Roadway, required her to to have a truck that met its specifications. The list price was $37,800, with Jean having to make 60 monthly installments of $781.12 and a final, one-time payment of $8,000. In Jean’s view, it was ludicrous for Roadway and FedEx to call the drivers independent contractors. “We’re told what to do, when to do it, how to do it, when to take time off,” Jean said. “You have to wear their uniform. You can’t wear your hair certain ways. You have to deliver every single thing they put on the truck.” Jean called it “a great deal for FedEx. They don’t have to pay for trucks, for the insurance, for fuel, for maintenance, for tires,” she said. “We have to pay for all those things. And they don’t have to pay our Social Security.” By some estimates, this arrangement saves FedEx $400 million a year, giving it a significant cost advantage over U.P.S., which treats its drivers as regular employees. Moreover, FedEx Ground has sought to rebuff a Teamster organizing drive by arguing that its 15,000 drivers have no right to unionize because they are independent contractors. “These drivers are more like business people,” said Perry Colosimo, a FedEx Ground spokesman. “They can set their own hours. They can buy routes. They can develop their business.” In 30 lawsuits, FedEx Ground drivers have argued that they are employees, not independent contractors, and that the company should therefore pay for their trucks, insurance, repairs, gas and tires. In one lawsuit, a California judge ruled that FedEx Ground was engaged in an elaborate ruse in which FedEx “has close to absolute control” over the drivers. Last December, FedEx acknowledged another setback: the I.R.S. assessed it $319 million in taxes and penalties for 2002 for misclassifying employees as independent contractors. FedEx could face similar I.R.S. penalties for subsequent years. FedEx said it would appeal. To attract drivers, FedEx Ground often runs ads claiming that its drivers earn $60,000 to $80,000 a year. Many drivers say those ads are deceiving. Gross income can exceed $60,000, but Jean, echoing many drivers, said she had to pay nearly $800 a month for her truck, $125 a week for gas, $55 a week for business equipment, $4,000 a year for insurance policies, plus outlays for tires, maintenance and repairs. Some years, Jean calculated, her net pay was just $32,000, amounting to $10.25 an hour. Many drivers find it hard to walk away because they have invested so much in their trucks. If they leave, they might still be stuck with years of monthly payments and the final payment of $8,000. One morning in August 2004, Jean doubled over in pain. Three days later, her doctor informed her she had ovarian cancer. 1 2 3 Next Page » This article is adapted from "The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker," by Steven Greenhouse, a reporter for The New York Times.

In Oklahoma City, couples planning their weddings are demonstrating uncustomary thrift, forgoing Dungeness crab and special linens. And in many cities, the registers at department stores like Nordstrom on the higher end and J. C. Penney in the middle are ringing less often. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Signs of Trouble Related Times Topics: United States Economy With Wall Street caught in a credit crisis that has captured headlines, the forces assailing the economy are now spreading beyond areas hit hardest by the boom-turned-bust in real estate like California, Florida and Nevada. Now, the downturn is seeping into new parts of the country, to communities that seemed insulated only months ago. The broadening of the slowdown, the plunge in home prices and near-paralysis in the financial system are fueling worries that what most economists now see as an inevitable recession could end up being especially painful. Indeed, some economists fear it will last longer and inflict more bite on workers and businesses than the last two recessions, which gripped the economy in 2001 and for eight months straddling 1990 and 1991. This time, these experts say, a recession in which economic activity falls over a sustained period and joblessness rises across the board could even persist into next year. “It’s not hard to construct very dark scenarios, primarily because the financial system is in disarray, and it’s not clear how to get it all back together again,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. To be sure, there are many places where talk of recession still seems as out of place as a diner trying to score a table at a trendy Los Angeles restaurant without reservations on a Saturday night. First-class cabins of airplanes are jammed. So are spas, cigar bars and children’s clothing boutiques selling upscale dresses. Unemployment, meanwhile, still remains at a relatively low 4.8 percent. But even after the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary efforts to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns from spreading to other financial institutions, the danger still lurks that banks will grow even tighter with their funds and will starve the economy of capital. “If lenders and debtors don’t trust each other, that causes a power outage,” said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. “And that’s where we are now.” Until recently, Mr. Darda was among those still holding to the notion that the economy could generate enough jobs to keep the economy rolling. But the private sector has shed jobs for three consecutive months. Mr. Darda is now worried. “We’ll be lucky to make it out of this without something that looks like a recession,” he said. On Thursday, FedEx , whose global courier business tends to rise and fall with swings in the economy, reported that its earnings actually dropped in the United States and warned that in future months it expected to fall well short of its customary double-digit annualized profit gains. “We just aren’t going to be able to do that,” Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said in a call with Wall Street analysts. “The crystal ball for everybody is very cloudy here.” For now, there are still pockets of prosperity across the country. Farmers are enjoying record crop prices as the adoption of ethanol makes corn a way to fill gas tanks, and as rising incomes in China, India and elsewhere spell growing demand for meat. The weak dollar is helping exporters and retailers that cater to foreign tourists. Eastern Mountain Sports, the outdoor clothing dealer, says sales increased by one-third this month compared with the year before at its store in SoHo. “A lot of that is Europeans coming over,” said Will Manzer, the company’s president. With oil selling at approximately $100 a barrel, the Taste of Texas Steakhouse in Houston  a popular spot for events held by BP, Shell and Exxon Mobil  is reveling in days of plenty. Even those areas suffering the downturn can bank on considerable help on the way, economists say, as the impact of lowered interest rates kicks in later this year, encouraging businesses to expand and hire. Tax rebate checks to be mailed out by the government this spring may lubricate spending as well. Despite fears that the odds for a particularly severe recession have now increased, Mr. Zandi still subscribes to the consensus that the economy will shrink only modestly during the first half of 2008, then resume expanding as more money washes through the system. That would limit the damage to the type of relatively modest recession that hit the economy earlier this decade. For the country as a whole, recent data shows that the economy is deteriorating at an accelerating rate. From September to January, average home prices fell 6 percent compared with a year earlier. Consumer confidence has been plummeting. The private sector shed 26,000 jobs in January and 101,000 in February, while those out of work have stayed jobless longer, according to the Labor Department. Now, the broader discomfort is filtering into cities and towns that only recently seemed beyond reach. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/opinion/02sun2.html?ref=fedexcorporation">A Verdict for Workers, for a Change<date>Published: March 2, 2008</date><text>The Supreme Court ruled last week that a group of employees suing for age discrimination should get their day in court even though they filed their complaint on the wrong form. The decision is noteworthy because it suggests that this court could be pulling back from what has often seemed like a knee-jerk inclination to rule for corporations over workers and consumers. Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » A group of couriers over the age of 40 sued Federal Express, claiming it tried to push out older workers. The issue was whether they submitted a proper complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within the legal time limit. FedEx claimed the couriers filed the wrong form, but the court ruled, 7 to 2, that an intake questionnaire and a signed affidavit  which the E.E.O.C. considered a valid complaint  met its “permissive standard” for what was acceptable. It is surprising and welcome to see the court apply any sort of permissive standard, considering how it ruled in a similar case just last year. Through a tortured and illogical reading of the law, the court ruled, 5 to 4, that a Goodyear employee missed the deadline for filing a complaint that she was paid less than male colleagues. That was one of a series of rulings in recent years that stretched the law to come out against little-guy parties. In one egregious decision last year, the court ignored its precedents to hold that an inmate lost the right to challenge his murder conviction because he missed a deadline  even though he had filed the appeal by the day the federal district judge (mistakenly) told him to. The FedEx ruling could be an aberration, or it could mark a new direction. The justices may have been chastened by the enormous criticism of the Goodyear ruling from Congress and the public. (The House has passed a bill reversing it, and the Senate may soon follow.) They may also be reacting  as the court has been known to do  to shifting political winds. Voters in this election year do not appear to favor the blind deference to corporate power that has been a theme of the last seven years. It would be a mistake to read too much into one decision. There is certainly evidence the court will not easily shake its undue solicitude for the problems of corporations. One example came last week, in Exxon’s challenge to a $2.5 billion punitive damages award against it arising out of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Chief Justice John Roberts, who once practiced corporate law, asked, “So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this?” The court has been on a campaign to strike down large awards of punitive damages against corporations, but the lawyer for the oil spill’s victims, Professor Jeffrey Fisher of Stanford Law School, had the answer: “It can hire fit and competent people.” More Articles in Opinion »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/us/28age.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Supreme Court Alters Tone in Discrimination Case<date>Published: February 28, 2008</date><text>WASHINGTON  The failure to file the proper form to complain about job-related age discrimination does not deprive an employee of the ability to go into court later with a discrimination lawsuit, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. In its relaxed approach to formalities, the 7-to-2 decision marked a decided change in tone for the Roberts court compared with one of the signature decisions of the previous term. In the earlier case, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the court ruled by a vote of 5 to 4 that employees complaining about discrimination in pay forfeited their right to sue if they did not file a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of a manager’s discriminatory pay decision. On Wednesday, by contrast, the new majority stressed the need for a “permissive standard” that would not shut the door on workers who were not represented by lawyers and who could be expected to make a layman’s mistakes. “The system must be accessible to individuals who have no detailed knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency processes,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority, adding that it was “consistent with the purposes” of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to allow the initial complaint to be submitted on a form that was “easy to complete,” or even as “an informal document, easy to draft.” The dissenters were Justices Clarence Thomas  a former chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  and Antonin Scalia. Justice Thomas, referring to the age discrimination law by its initials, complained that the majority had adopted a standard “so malleable that it effectively absolves the E.E.O.C. of its obligation to administer the A.D.E.A. according to discernible standards.” The court had employed “utterly vague criteria,” Justice Thomas said. Justice Scalia signed the dissent. Of the seven members in the majority, three  Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., along with Justice Kennedy  had voted in the majority in the Ledbetter case. The dissenters from that decision  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer  objected that the court was ignoring the realities of the workplace. In both cases, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took a position that favored the employees. But in the Ledbetter case, the Bush administration repudiated the commission’s policy and entered the case on the employer’s behalf. By contrast, in the case decided Wednesday, Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, No. 06-1322, the administration supported the commission and argued on behalf of 14 Federal Express couriers who complained that newly adopted policies were aimed at forcing out older workers. Under the age discrimination law, employees must first file a discrimination charge with the E.E.O.C., and then wait 60 days before filing a lawsuit, in order to give the commission time to try to resolve the matter with the employer. In this instance, the employees filed the wrong document with the commission, an “intake questionnaire” rather than a formal “charge” document. They accompanied that document with an affidavit that described the problem and asked the commission to “please force Federal Express to end their age discrimination plan.” After the employees filed suit, the Federal District Court in Manhattan found the document insufficient and granted the employer’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the suit, in a decision that the ruling on Wednesday affirmed. The suit, filed in 2002, has yet to go to trial.

The ruling, disclosed by FedEx on Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, determined that workers at FedEx Ground should be reclassified as employees instead of as independent contractors. The I.R.S. is auditing similar issues for 2004 through 2006, the filing said. “Given the preliminary status of this matter, we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss,” FedEx said in the filing. “However, we do not believe that any loss is probable.” The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has asserted FedEx Ground workers are employees and is campaigning to unionize drivers at FedEx Ground, welcomed the decision. “It’s game over for FedEx’s independent contractor scam,” the union’s president, Jim Hoffa, said in a statement. The union said penalties against FedEx could eventually top $1 billion, since the current penalty only covers the year 2002. FedEx said that it has “strong defenses to the I.R.S.’s tentative assessment and will vigorously defend” its position that FedEx Ground’s owner-operators are independent contractors. FedEx Ground uses 15,000 drivers who are paid as independent contractors. Under the system, FedEx Ground drivers can own multiple routes and employ other drivers to deliver packages.

''The premise was simple: barter, borrow or buy secondhand for a year -- food, drink, health and safety necessities excluded,'' Zachary Slobig writes in Good. ''Yes, they could buy toilet paper and new underwear, but, say, a gallon of white house paint or new dog toys? Unacceptable.'' From that idea, a consumer movement has been born. Some 9,000 people worldwide have signed up to do the same thing. They call themselves the Compact, in homage to the Mayflower Compact, the 1620 social contract drawn up by the Pilgrims who vowed to build a better life in the New World. While saving money is a pleasant byproduct -- one woman who has been part of the group from the beginning estimates she has saved ''$4,000 during her period of abstinence'' -- members of the Compact are mainly trying to reduce the amount of trash they generate. As Mr. Slobig writes: ''Americans generated 24.6 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2005 -- a 60 percent increase since 1980 -- and more than half of that mass went into 1,654 landfills. That is like a fleet of 1,800 Queen Mary 2 cruise ships being buried every year.'' GIFT IDEA 1 If you are still uncertain what to give for the holidays, Worth magazine has a suggestion. ''The Dutch architect Janjapp Ruijssenaars has designed a bed that will have you floating on air -- literally,'' Jennifer O'Reilly writes. ''For $1.6 million, customers can purchase the buoyant bed, which is held about 16 inches off the ground by magnets within and beneath it that repel each other.'' Four wires tie the bed to the floor. A ''miniversion,'' which floats three inches off the ground, is available for a mere $160,000. ''Though Ruijssenaars assures buyers that the bed is safe, those with metallic medical devices such as pacemakers should not venture below,'' Ms. O'Reilly writes. ''They might find themselves more attached to their new bed than they would like.'' GIFT IDEAS 2, 3 AND MORE The Robb Report gift guide is filled with ideas that most of us can only fantasize about -- fabulous cars (like the $250,000 Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione ) humongous boats (there is a 459-foot six-deck yacht that starts at $250 million) and dazzling jewelry (a 300-carat diamond necklace for a minimum of $16 million.) Our favorites: A carousel that features 30 horses, a lion, tiger and zebra (oh, my) that will be arranged three deep, will ''stand from four to six feet tall'' and will bounce on a mechanism powered by an electric motor. It comes with a 14-foot-tall calliope to provide the music. It will take a minimum of 18 months to design, carve and build. So it might be best to think of this as a Christmas present for 2009. And then there is a one-of-a-kind 18.5-foot-long exact scale (1:48) model of the Titanic that weighs 1,500 pounds ''and features teak decking and signage that is accurate and, in some cases, legible only when viewed through a magnifying glass.'' It took seven people working full time for seven years -- ''three years longer than it took to complete the 882-foot ship.'' Price: $2.5 million. FINAL TAKE The following tidbits come courtesy of Harper's: Americans lose about $8 billion annually by not redeeming gift cards. FedEx transported 11,854 Christmas trees last year to American troops. When asked if they believed the children who say they have been good during the last year, only 54 percent of shopping mall and party Santas said ''yes.'' PAUL B.

Skip to next paragraph Béatrice de Géa for The New York Times The tractor-trailer, presents intact, was found abandoned in Greenpoint at 5:30 a.m. Friday. It ended hours later in Brooklyn as just another bungled crime when the would-be robbers were unable to figure out how to remove the metal cargo containers, filled with merchandise, locked up in the back of the truck, the police said Friday. The episode unraveled little by little over seven hours, the police said. In the end, the truck driver was unharmed and none of the cargo appeared to be missing, officials said  not even the jewelry and other valuables. The police say they believe at least three people were involved. “Now this is a criminal impersonation, a case, a police impersonation case,” Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said at a news conference at 1 Police Plaza. “It was a kidnapping and he was let go, but they were not able to get inside the containers in the vehicle.” For the truck’s driver, the ordeal began around 10:30 Thursday night during a routine haul to Newark Liberty International Airport, where the metal containers were to be loaded onto planes and taken to other destinations. Sandra Muñoz, a FedEx spokeswoman, said, “You can make a safe assumption in saying there is a lot of holiday packages in there.” The driver, a FedEx veteran who was not identified, told investigators that he left a depot at 538 West 34th Street and had reached 47th Street and 11th Avenue when a maroon sport utility vehicle pulled in front of him. Several people jumped out, and one flashed a silver badge. They forced him into their vehicle at gunpoint, then tossed him a pair of handcuffs and made him lock his hands in front of his waist, the police said. He was then ordered to lie face-down in the back of the S.U.V. The driver told investigators that he could hear his truck being driven away, the police said, and that the two vehicles seemed to be heading in opposite directions. The FedEx driver told investigators he believed he was driven over the Manhattan Bridge, the police said, but was not sure where he was. As the hours ticked by, the two captors in the S.U.V. kept on driving, stopping once at a restaurant for takeout Italian food. At one point, one said he had spent “a couple of hundred bucks” on the phony police badge. “Did it fool you?” he asked the FedEx driver, the police said. The kidnappers also asked the driver how the metal containers in his truck could be removed, and he gave them instructions, which they relayed by cellphone. But the containers could not be freed. Ms. Muñoz said they are difficult to dislodge. “It’s not something you can just pull out and walk away with, that’s for sure,” she said. “If you find the guy who can pull them out and lift them and march away, I don’t want to meet him.” At 1:30 a.m. on Friday, the assailants dumped the FedEx driver out at Harrison and Flushing Avenues in Williamsburg, the police said, after threatening him; they had his wallet and his driver’s license, and said they knew where he lived. The driver then flagged down a passing police car. “The detectives find the driver credible, and FedEx has expressed confidence in him as a valued employee of 22 years,” said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. The truck has a capacity for 80,000 pounds of cargo, Ms. Muñoz said, though she could not say whether it was fully loaded. It was found abandoned around 5:30 a.m. at West and India Streets in Greenpoint, the police said. Ms. Muñoz said on Friday night that since all the contents were recovered, the company was trying to deliver the packages as quickly as possible. “We’ll do everything we can to get those packages to the recipients in time for Christmas,” she said. Before leaving the driver, the kidnappers gave him $60 in cash, the police said. It is not clear why, although the gesture brings to mind the movie “GoodFellas,” in which truckers were tipped before being robbed. Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

Growth overseas tempered the effects of the economic slowdown in the United States and helped FedEx, which owns the world’s largest cargo airline, meet its lowered earnings expectations for the quarter. But its forecast profit for the current quarter was below Wall Street estimates. Its shares fell $1, to $93.63. FedEx earned $479 million, or $1.54 a share, for the three months ended Nov. 30 compared with $511 million, or $1.64 a share, a year ago. The company lowered its expected earnings for the second quarter last month to a range of $1.45 to $1.55, down from $1.60 to $1.75. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial predicted earnings of $1.50 a share on their own lowered expectations. Revenue rose 6 percent to $9.45 billion, from $8.93 billion last year. Analysts were expecting revenues of $9.32 billion. “The domestic economy is hurting in a number of ways, and some of those ways are hitting FedEx pretty hard,” an analyst at Edward Jones, Dan Ortwerth said. “They’re still expanding their business globally, getting real traction, and they’re still taking market share in the home delivery business here in the United States.” The outlook for the United States economy remains poor, but “we don’t think that the United States is going to see an economic meltdown,” the chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said. “We don’t think there is going to be strong growth in the U.S. economy, and that’s what our forecast is built around.” For the third quarter, the company expects to earn $1.15 to $1.30 a share, compared with $1.35 a share a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expect a profit of $1.37 a share. Less-than-truckload shipments for the FedEx Freight segment fell 6 percent from the same period last year because of the economic slowdown, the company said.

The three lawyers arguing the case matched it in obscurity. Two were first-timers at the court, and the third last appeared there in 1965. For these reasons, the courtroom figured to be nearly empty. That it was not  in fact, the seats reserved for members of the Supreme Court bar were almost full  reflected the fact that the last time the Roberts court took up an obscure employment discrimination case, the 5-to-4 result quickly became a cause célèbre and a signature decision of the entire term. That was last May in the Ledbetter decision, in which the court imposed a tight time frame for filing pay discrimination cases, rejecting the view of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that such lawsuits are timely as long as a current paycheck reflects a prior discriminatory pay decision. The new case challenges another pro-employee position of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, its interpretation of the type of document an employee must file to initiate a charge of job-related age discrimination. The commission takes a relaxed view, accepting a written complaint that reflects an employee’s intent to pursue a case, even if the document is not the official “Form 5” designated for a formal “charge of discrimination.” The federal appeals court in New York upheld the commission’s position, reinstating an age discrimination suit that a group of couriers had filed against Federal Express. The Federal District Court had dismissed the suit, filed in April 2002, on the ground that the 14 plaintiffs had failed to file the required initial charge of discrimination with the commission before going to court. Instead of filling out Form 5, Patricia Kennedy, the lead plaintiff, had filled out Form 283, which the commission calls an “intake questionnaire.” Its purpose is to describe the accusations of discrimination enough to enable commission officials to advise an employee whether those accusations justify moving to the stage, a formal charge. Under commission rules, a formal charge is followed promptly by notice to the employer. In reinstating the lawsuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the commission that the intake questionnaire should be treated as a charge, because it had enough information and showed the intent to make a formal accusation. Federal Express, in its appeal, argues that this laxity and inconsistency in the procedures deprives employers of what various federal antidiscrimination laws meant to provide them  formal notice of an employee’s complaint and the chance to resolve it without going to court. Giving the employer that chance is “a requirement, an indispensable prerequisite to a lawsuit,” Connie L. Lensing, a lawyer for Federal Express making her first Supreme Court argument, told the justices. “A charge needs to clearly delineate that it’s a charge,” Ms. Lensing said. The two lawyers on the other side said the purpose of the flexibility was to avoid trapping employees in unfamiliar paperwork. David L. Rose, representing the plaintiffs, said that as a lawyer experienced in employment discrimination cases, he was not aware of the difference between the two forms before taking this case. Mr. Rose last argued a Supreme Court case in 1965. Arguing for the commission, Toby J. Heytens, an assistant to the solicitor general who was making his first Supreme Court argument, said “the vast majority of people who initiate E.E.O.C. proceedings are lay people who aren’t familiar with the statute.” The court’s response to this clash between formality and practicality was what the courtroom audience had come to see. Would the case, Federal Express Corporation v. Holowecki, No. 06-1322, turn into this term’s Ledbetter case? The answer appeared to be probably not. While the Bush administration disavowed the commission’s policy in the Ledbetter case and argued on the employer’s behalf, here the solicitor general’s office supported the policy. The justices also seemed to want to shield employees from the consequences of the commission’s failure to follow the letter of the law. “I just don’t understand your leap from government incompetence to saying the plaintiff loses,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said to Ms. Lensing. The commission came in for harsh criticism from both ends of the bench for failing to give clear advice about legal requirements. Only Justice Clarence Thomas, who spent eight years as head of the commission, said nothing. As the other justices puzzled over regulations adopted during his tenure there, he leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.

Earnings Beat Expectations<date>Published: October 24, 2007</date><text>United Parcel Service posted a better-than-expected profit yesterday, citing growth in its global business, supply chain and freight unit, as well as modest growth in its United States package business despite a sluggish economy. Although U.P.S.s results should continue to be driven by its international business and gains at the supply chain and freight unit, the chief financial officer, D. Scott Davis, warned in a statement that slowing retail sales will restrain U.S. domestic volume growth. Mr. Davis is scheduled to become the companys chief executive in January. But in an interview with Reuters, Mr. Davis said he expected United States economic growth to be a little better in 2008 than in 2007. Like its main rival, FedEx, U.P.S. is seen as a bellwether of United States economic health, based on the premise that package volumes rise in a more vibrant economy and fall when growth slows. U.P.S., the worlds largest package-delivery company, reported third-quarter net income of $1.08 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a $46 million restructuring charge and related expenses for a supply-chain business in France, earnings per share for the quarter amounted to $1.05. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, based in Atlanta, reported third-quarter revenue of $12.21 billion, up from $11.66 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $12.24 billion. The story at U.P.S. is steady as she goes, despite some choppy waters in the freight market, said Keith Schoonmaker, an analyst at Morningstar. Revenue at U.P.S.s domestic package business rose 2 percent to $7.55 billion. U.P.S.s international package business increased 12 percent, to $2.53 billion, and sales at the companys supply chain and freight unit rose 6 percent, to $2.13 billion. I am impressed at how U.P.S. has turned supply chain and freight into a profitable operation despite a depressed less-than-truckload market, Mr. Schoonmaker said. U.P.S. Freight is a less-than-truckload operator. Like the rest of the United States trucking market, less-than-truckload companies, which consolidate smaller loads into a single truck, have had weak freight volumes since the third quarter of 2006. Mr. Davis, the chief financial officer, said U.P.S. Freights growth had come from taking less-than-truckload market share, which he said should continue for the next several years. U.P.S. expects full-year earnings per share of $4.13 to $4.19. Analysts had predicted full-year earnings per share of $4.15. U.P.S. shares were up 0.7 percent, or 55 cents, to $75.64.

Still, fund managers say they are finding companies that offer solid growth prospects at a decent valuation. Other than the stock pickers’ admiration, the selections have little in common. Some companies are small and virtually unheard-of; others are among the largest on earth. FedEx is the choice of Randy Haase, manager of the Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund. Shares of the package-delivery service are trading down for the year, a result of subdued earnings growth as the company finances a costly program to improve its infrastructure in the United States, China and India. Once that is out of the way, in the next couple of years, its profits should resume rising in percentages in the mid- to upper teens, he predicted. Such growth would make the stock cheap at its recent valuation of 13 times the earnings that analysts forecast for next year, he said. John Osterweis, manager of the Osterweis fund, likes Genworth Financial, an insurance company whose stock has been hammered  unreasonably, in his opinion  because a small portion of its business involves underwriting mortgage insurance. The stock recently traded at barely more than the intrinsic worth of Genworth’s assets and 10 times current earnings, and the woes in the mortgage industry could give the company cover to raise its rates, he said. Robert Lloyd, lead manager of the AIM Summit fund, likes a company whose stock has been shunned lately: Intuit, the maker of tax-preparation software. “It’s a good bread-and-butter business, with good fundamentals and cash flow,” he said. “Even if we have a consumer recession and corporate America pulled back on spending, people are still going to have to file their taxes.” Attending trade shows may not have the same urgency, but Jim Tringas, a manager of small- and mid-capitalization funds for Evergreen Investments, says business will be good enough to make the stock of Viad, a provider of exhibition booths and related services, worth owning. Viad was sold heavily by hedge funds that had owned it and needed to raise cash during the mini-panic last month in the credit markets, he said. Viad trades at 16 times estimates of 2008 earnings, and it has $6 of cash per share on its balance sheet; the company plans to return a portion of that to shareholders via a stock buyback. Mr. Tringas noted that small-capitalization stocks have fared worse than the large caps this year, which in his view makes smaller companies better values. The selection of Barbara Walchli, manager of the Aquila Rocky Mountain fund, is a health care stock  sort of. In recommending Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, she referred to a report this month from the Mayo Clinic promoting the therapeutic value of dark chocolate. Whichever virtues of chocolate consumers find appealing, they are buying enough to have sent the company’s earnings up 220 percent over three years, yet the stock is trading around where it was in early 2005. NO small caps for Robert Gendelman, manager of the Legg Mason Capital and Income fund. He prefers a venerable corporate giant, General Electric, whose fortunes seem to improve each time the dollar ticks lower. “One of the benefits of a weaker currency is that companies that sell abroad are very competitive,” he said. “General Electric is a case in point.” The comparative weakness of small caps this year may persuade Mr. Tringas and Ms. Walchli that the best opportunities are at that end of the spectrum. But Mr. Gendelman points out that the story was different for most of the decade, one reason that he believes that blue chips like G.E. offer better prospects. “After small-cap and mid-cap stocks outperformed their large-cap brethren for the last five years, large-cap represents the best value in the market,” he said. “They are valued extremely attractively given their growth prospects, particularly companies with strong balance sheets and diversified business models around the world.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/business/21fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Has Strong Quarter but Lowers Outlook for Year<date>Published: September 21, 2007</date><text>MEMPHIS, Sept. 20 (AP)  The FedEx Corporation, the shipping company, said Thursday that its quarterly profit beat Wall Streets expectations but lowered its outlook for the full year, blaming the downturn in the housing market. FedEx said it earned $494 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with $475 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the first quarter of FedExs fiscal year, rose 8 percent, to $9.2 billion. The results topped the profit of $1.54 a share and the revenue of $9.07 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, but FedExs stock fell $2.94, to $104.57 a share. Looking ahead, FedEx forecast second-quarter earnings of $1.60 to $1.75 a share, below analysts average estimate of $1.97 a share. For the full year, which ends in May, FedEx cut its forecast to $6.70 to $7.10 a share, from $7 to $7.40 a share. Analysts currently predict profit of $7.19 a share for the full year. The company predicted a slow second quarter in part on the acquisition of a freight line that is taking longer than expected to pay off as a result of the downturn in the housing market, which affects sales of durable goods. Fuel and legal costs also contributed to the predictions of slower second-quarter growth. In a conference call with analysts, FedExs chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said expansions in Britain and China were helping drive growth. A new route between Manchester, England, and the United States will increase daily capacity on the important U.K. to U.S. route by up to 50 percent, he said. In China, the company has offered domestic next-business-day shipping since May and increased the number of cities and counties where the service is offered to 30 from 19.

Woods Nears Prize<date>Published: September 16, 2007</date><text>ATLANTA, Sept. 15  Phil Mickelson lowered his head, shook it from side to side, then thumped the soft sod in the No. 7 tee box with the heel of his driver. Skip to next paragraph Tami Chappell/Reuters Tiger Woods has a three-stroke lead entering the final round of the Tour Championship in Atlanta. P.G.A. Tour Leader Board Results/Schedule Stats | Money Leaders 2007 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open P.G.A. Championship Other Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European Clearly discouraged, he had just bogeyed No. 5 and No. 6 on Saturday, and it might have been his first realization that he was not going to claim the projected $11.2 million payday here Sunday for winning the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup playoffs. I wouldnt say it is frustrating, Mickelson said before pausing, perhaps thinking that frustrating was the right word to use after all. Twenty-five feet away, Steve Stricker was busy signing autographs. He is pretty certain that he is not going to win the FedEx Cup and the $10 million annuity that is the first prize, or the $1.2 million for winning the Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club. Stricker started the Tour Championship, the last of the four tournaments that make up the PGA Tours FedEx Cup playoffs, in second place in the standings behind Tiger Woods. Stricker needed to win the Tour Championship to win the FedEx Cup, but he is tied for 22nd, 16 shots behind Woods, who leads at 19 under. Mickelson started the tournament in third place in the Cup standings. He managed to shoot par 70 here Saturday and is tied for 14th, 13 shots behind Woods. I would imagine its all Tigers, Stricker said of the FedEx Cup bonanza. Phil and I are going to have to shoot in the 50s on Sunday to beat him. Considering that only three players have shot the PGA-record 59, Woodss bank account seems likely to grow substantially Sunday. Considering how far behind Stricker and Mickelson are in the Tour Championship, Woods does not even have to win the tournament to claim the $10 million Fed Ex Cup prize, which would be paid as an annuity into his retirement account. With an 8 percent annual return on his investment, the 31-year-old Woods could turn the $10 million into about $30 million by the time he turns 45, when he would be able to withdraw the money. So, if he wins the Tour Championship and its $1.2 million first prize Sunday, Woods is looking at a payday that could exceed $30 million. The whole idea is to win the tournament, Woods said when asked about the huge payoff. Winning the tournament takes care of everything else. Woods will be paired Sunday with Mark Calcavecchia, who shot a 63 Saturday under crisp blue skies to move into second in tournament, three shots behind Woods. So, I have to beat him by four to win the tournament, Calcavecchia said. Not likely. To stay in contention for the FedEx Cup, Mickelson needed a day like the one Zach Johnson had. The 31-year old Johnson fired a 10-under 60 for Saturdays best round.

You just know your place. You know what he is capable of doing and you just shake your head. After only two rounds in the Tour Championship, Woods is putting a hammerlock on the PGA Tours FedEx Cup playoffs. He finished the second round with a 63 to lead the tournament by three strokes at 13-under-par 127. If Woods wins the Tour Championship, he will win the $10 million annuity in the inaugural PGA Tour playoff. I dont know if its a zone or not, Woods said after the round. I just felt that the rhythm was good. I just felt it was a nice rhythm. The pace was good, walking pace was good, the swing was good. Discussing his sizzling front nine, Woods said: I hit one bad putt that went in. I was hitting good shots through that stretch. It was nice. The only poor shot I hit was the tee shot there at 5. It was just a terrible shot. Other than that, I really hit some good shots. Stricker and Mickelson had a chance to challenge Woods for the FedEx Cup before the tournament started, but they will have to count on a collapse by Woods and Herculean efforts of their own to have shot at claiming the $10 million prize. Mickelson is tied for 12th at six under and Stricker is tied for 16th at four under. If Mickelson rallies to win the tournament, Woods can still claim the FedEx Cup with a second- or third-place finish. Stricker, who is second in the FedEx Cup points race, has to win this tournament to jump past Woods, an unlikely outcome because so many players are lined up in front of Stricker. Having seen what Woods can do up close Friday, Stricker sounded as if he was playing for second place in the FedEx Cup. Im still going to have to play well, he said. Phil is just behind me in the points list, and K. J. Choi and guys like that, where if they play well, they could end up passing me. I want to protect my spot. Although Woods is in command in the FedEx Cup race, he has work to do to shake Woody Austin, who is second in the Tour Championship after two rounds at 10 under. Tim Clark, Mark Calcavecchia and Adam Scott are tied for third at nine under. Woods cooled off after blasting through his first nine holes and came back to the field. After his 70-footer on No. 9, he went five holes before making his next birdie, and he had two bogeys on the back nine. Still, his 13-under total was his best start in a tournament since he was 15 under through 36 holes at Firestone in 2000. Woods said there was no creativity necessary at East Lake because the rain-softened greens held a shot once it landed, and shots usually landed with a thud. If golfers did a good job measuring their yardage on their approach shots, there was no risk of blowing past a hole. These greens are such that you just take the low line and just hit it, and hopefully it goes in, Woods said. Youre not really used to putting this way, always taking the low line and hitting it. Im used to taking the higher line and kind of feeding the golf ball in there. Its a different mentality. Firing it into the greens is a totally different mentality. Its just different this week. The players were probably grateful for a tournament in which they did not have to labor to score. The greens were bumpy, but Mickelson said it was nice not to be beaten up by rough, rock-hard greens, which is usually the case throughout the summer or in the majors. Of course, the spongy greens at this tournament do not explain all of Woodss marvelous shot-making. As Mickelson was lining up a 12-foot putt for birdie on the par-3 No. 6, Woods was excavating a shot from the bunker on No. 5 and draining it. The crowd erupted in reaction to Woodss shot just before Mickelson made his birdie putt, which was a terrific shot, but second-rate compared with the one Woods made. Mickelson finished his round with a 66. Theres a lot of birdies out there, so I have got to get aggressive tomorrow, Mickelson said. Hopefully, some putts will fall and Ill be able to make a run where I have a chance on Sunday. More Articles in Sports »</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/sports/golf/14golf.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Underdog and Weather Wreak Havoc<date>Published: September 14, 2007</date><text>ATLANTA, Sept. 13  There is still plenty of time for a triumphant finish to the FedEx Cup, which would make these inaugural PGA Tour playoffs a success for the organizers. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson may yet march down the fairways here Sunday dueling for $10 million, as long as nobody gets in the way. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Erik S. Lesser/European Pressphoto Agency Tim Clark, who cant win the FedEx Cup, took a first round lead before play was suspended. P.G.A. Tour Leader Board Results/Schedule Stats | Money Leaders 2007 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open P.G.A. Championship Other Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European For now, however, Woods and Mickelson have been joined on stage first by a player who did not expect to be here, and second by more rain from Mother Nature. Tim Clark, a 5-foot-7 South African whose long putter can knock him on the chin, tied the East Lake Golf Club record Thursday with an eight-under-par 62 in the first round of the Tour Championship. The round cannot be labeled spectacular because of the easy conditions  the scoring average for the field was 67.224. But it was noteworthy because the lowest score was recorded by Clark, who barely got into the 30-player field and is not in the running for the Cup, and not by Woods or Mickelson. A rain delay of 3 hours 3 minutes kept Woods and Mickelson from finishing their rounds. Woods started with birdies on his first three holes and was four under through 11 before play was suspended. Mickelson, who struggled early, was three under through 12 holes. Twenty players did not complete the first round, and will resume play Friday at 8 a.m. More rain in the wake of Hurricane Humberto is expected to roll through the area Friday, so tee times for the second round have been moved up to 9 a.m. The wild cards  the weather, which has gone from drought to downpour, and the bumpy greens  could make for an interesting ride to the finish Sunday. And there is no guarantee Woods and Mickelson will be able to get through their rounds Friday, because heavy storms are predicted for early in the afternoon. Clark said the lack of pressure was probably a factor in his round. Maybe thats a good thing for me that the attention is somewhere else, Clark said. I dont have a chance to win the FedEx Cup, so really its not about me, its about this tournament right now. The guys out there fighting for the FedEx Cup have probably got a lot more on their minds than I do right now. Clark had six birdies and an eagle and never seemed fazed by the rain delay in the middle of the afternoon. He called his eagle on 15 lucky because the ball struck the pin, which kept it from flying past and ruining his terrific round. The players were not helped by any running on the fairways because of the soft conditions, but they were able to fire darts at the soft greens. Woods took just two shots before rain halted play and then came out more than three hours later and sank a birdie putt. He also birdied Nos. 2 and 3, but then cooled off. I made a couple of putts, I dont know how, Woods said. I hit them up there and they bounced all over the place and somehow went in. Padraig Harrington finished his round and was in second place with a 63. John Rollins got through his round with a six-under 64, good for a tie for third place with Mark Calcavecchia. Steve Stricker, who is second in the FedEx Cup standings behind Woods, was one over through 11 holes.

Skip to next paragraph P.G.A. Tour Leader Board Results/Schedule Stats | Money Leaders 2007 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open P.G.A. Championship Other Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European Faxon is out for the year after having an operation on his right foot to remove bunions. Quigley will have surgery on his right knee to repair torn cartilage as soon as he is eliminated from the FedEx Cup, which could be as early as this week if he finishes lower than second at the Deutsche Bank Championship. And they may be paying close attention to the PGA Tour money list the last two months. Faxon, 46, did not make a cut until March, and his best finish was a tie for 33rd in Hartford. He did not play well enough to qualify for any of the majors for the first time in his career. It was getting worse, Faxon said. The surgeon told me if I didnt do surgery soon, Id have a more difficult surgery later. Faxons two-year exemption from winning in Hartford runs out this year, so he is trying to stay in the top 25 on the career money list to use a one-time exemption for 2008. He is No. 24 by about $900,000 over David Duval, who may play in the fall depending on his family situation. Of greater concern are the players right behind Duval  Jerry Kelly, K. J. Choi and Adam Scott, all of whom are within $2 million of Faxon, with three FedEx Cup events worth at least $7 million each coming up. If he stays in the top 25, Faxon will use the one-time exemption. If he falls below that, Faxon said he probably would use his status as a past winner and ask for sponsors exemptions to get by next year. Quigleys right knee began bothering him in February, and only recently did he discover it was a torn meniscus. He took cortisone shots before the Barclays, but still walked with a limp. He will miss the rest of the year after the operation. Once the FedEx Cup is over, the Tour reverts to the money list, and the top 125 keep their cards for 2008. Quigley tied for 25th at Westchester and earned $49,035. That put him at $717,411 for the year; he should be safe. A year ago, Darren Clarke nailed down the 125th spot on the money list at about $660,000, and Tour officials say $700,000 is a safe number. Then again, no one knows what to expect out of the seven tournaments that make up the Fall Series, especially since the first one at Turning Stone has a $6 million purse. The Fall Series could be almost exclusively for players beyond the top 70, which could mean more starts and more money earned over the final two months of the season. Quigley could help himself with another strong week in Boston. If he fell out of the top 125, he could apply for a minor medical exemption. That would be a last resort, Quigley said. I dont even want to go down that road. WHERE IT ALL STARTED Before taking a vacation, Lorena Ochoa stopped by Palm Desert, Calif., on Tuesday where she was given a key to the city in advance of defending her title in October at the Samsung World Championship. That is where it all started for Ochoa. Her comeback victory in the California desert over Annika Sorenstam essentially wrapped up L.P.G.A. Player of the Year honors, and she has been on a roll ever since. Her victory at the Safeway Classic last Sunday was her third in a row and sixth of the year; no one else on the Tour has won more than twice. Ochoa broke the L.P.G.A. season earnings record with $2,891,590, about $28,000 more than Sorenstam won in 2002 when she captured 11 titles in 23 starts. Ochoa has played 19 times this year, and is virtually certain to become the first $3 million woman in golf, with at least four tournaments left on her schedule. Last year was a very important year for me, kind of a breakthrough, Ochoa said. I won six tournaments and I thought it would be hard to hit that mark this year, but that was my goal. Right now, Im just letting it happen and enjoying it. I know there are too many players behind me, so I need to keep working hard. More Articles in Sports »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/business/media/22adco.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Hopes for the Right Bounce From Golf<date>Published: August 22, 2007</date><text>IF you are south of Greenwich Street in Manhattan between noon and 5 p.m. today, look for a weird miniparade: A guy carrying a quiet sign followed by a golfer, his caddy and an entourage of nattily dressed fans. Skip to next paragraph One of the new FedEx advertisements for its PGA Tour campaign. Dont think its another bunch of aging hippies commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Summer of Love. The stunt is part of the endgame in a long and expensive campaign by FedEx to drum up frenzy over the FedEx Cup golf playoffs that start at the Westchester Country Club tomorrow. Sports pages have chronicled the disaffection some feel toward the PGA Tours first-ever championship playoff. Some dont like the way points are tallied; others complain about paying out the $10 million purse as an annuity. But keeping the players happy is the PGA Tours problem. FedExs job is to lure the fans. Neither the PGA Tour nor FedEx would talk numbers, but Tom Wade, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, said that FedEx had paid a substantial fee for the naming rights, a chunk of television advertising time, and tickets and hospitality opportunities at the events. And George J. Frangos, senior vice president of BBDO New York, FedExs agency, called this the largest sports effort weve done for FedEx. It may also be the longest drawn out. The FedEx car in last years Nascar races had a FedEx Cup promotion painted on its side. For much of this year, FedEx has been running ads in newspapers and golf publications, supplying excuses that people can use to skip work and watch the FedEx Cup playoffs. FedEx has also run humorous commercials showing the lengths people will go to for golf. In one, a boss holds a 6 a.m. meeting at which employees with cellphones vie to be the first to get him tee time at an exclusive club; in another, a young man substitutes a lifelike dummy of himself at a videoconference while he sneaks out to play. Each ends with the tagline We understand. FedEx proudly presents the FedEx Cup.  But now, the race to the pin begins. FedEx has set up a 12-story, three-dimensional billboard of a golf hole on a building on Greenwich Street, the starting point for todays golfers walk. It has cloaked its delivery trucks in a green plastic wrap that simulates grass and that advertises the FedEx Cup. It is peppering telephone kiosks, Pennsylvania and Grand Central stations, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal with what it calls guerrilla stickers  messages suggesting excuses for skipping work from Aug. 23 through Sept. 16, the duration of the event. (The dry cleaners lost all of my shirts. The copier is jammed. I am downloading a file on dial-up.) The hoopla will be replicated in Atlanta, where the finals will be held: another staged miniparade will go through the business district there; guerrilla stickers will decorate the airport, train and bus stations; and rapid-transit commuters will be treated to cheeky observations like most golfers will have played in the rain longer than it takes you to commute to and from work. Many of the commercials that FedEx will run during the tournament will continue to promote the cup, but others will promote services like printing (remember that FedEx now owns Kinkos), shipping and supply chain management. Since most people watch sports in real time, when youre embedded in the event, youre TiVo proof, said T. Michael Glenn, executive vice president for market development at FedEx. This is not FedExs first foray into golf. It has long sponsored the St. Jude classic, a charitable event in its hometown, Memphis. (This year, FedEx turned that sponsorship over to the Stanford Financial Group.) It has been a sponsor of the PGA Tour since 2002. And it has long had a thriving business shipping clubs to golf courses for both professional and amateur players. But FedEx executives wanted to put a higher profile on the golf connection. With global transportation costs skyrocketing, shipping decisions have increasingly been percolating up from the production floor to the high-level suites. And top executives and successful entrepreneurs play and watch golf. Golf is a perfect match for us from a customer demographic standpoint, said Mr. Glenn, adding that his research shows that customers bought more FedEx services after the company entertained them at a golf event. Marketing experts are not surprised. These days, all costs are getting scrutiny at higher corporate levels, so reaching out to this segment is a smart thing for FedEx to do, said Peter N. Golder, associate professor of marketing at New York Universitys Stern School of Business. And the successful entrepreneurs that FedEx wants to serve are also likely to be into golf. Indeed, it is no coincidence that todays parade is headed toward the financial district. We thought about Midtown, but there are so many tourists there, said Mr. Frangos of BBDO. We want to get the business people. The PGA Tour has plenty at stake too. For some time, the organization has felt confined by its 33-week season of events. We want the kind of structure that other sports have, which is a regular season and a climactic finish, Mr. Wade said.  So this year, the traditional tournaments will be precursors to a championship that begins in New York tomorrow, moves through Boston and Chicago, and culminates in Atlanta on Sept. 16. The winner  and yes, Tiger Woods is the front-runner  will receive that $10 million and a silver Tiffany cup. FedEx, Mr. Wade said, was the obvious partner to approach: a strong brand that does not compete with the companies that sponsor the individual tournaments. And it has a track record  like Nascar and football  of actively promoting the sports it chooses to sponsor. And golf, marketing experts say, is likely to establish an equally strong track record as an executive sport. Golf is one of the fastest growing sports, both for watching and playing, said Michael Watras, president of the brand consultancy Straightline International. Younger people, he suspects, embrace golf by choice; aging boomers turn to it by necessity. With tennis, your knees give out, he said. But with golf, you walk, you swing, you walk again. You can do that for a long time. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/sports/golf/18golf.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Cup Will Begin Without Woods<date>Published: August 18, 2007</date><text>Tiger Woods stars in television commercials for the PGA Tour’s inaugural FedEx Cup playoffs, whistling the theme to “Rocky III,” and speaking to a portrait of Bobby Jones. But he will not appear in next week’s kickoff tournament at Westchester Country Club. Skip to next paragraph P.G.A. Tour Leader Board Results/Schedule Stats | Money Leaders 2007 Majors The Masters U.S. Open British Open P.G.A. Championship Other Golf L.P.G.A. | Champions European Woods, citing fatigue, has decided to skip the Barclays event, which starts Thursday, a blow to a playoff series that the Tour has been marketing for nearly two years. Woods did say that he planned to play in the other three events. Woods, the No. 1 golfer in the world and the top-ranked player in the FedEx Cup standings, had said for weeks that it was his intention to play in all four events, starting with the Barclays in Harrison, N.Y., and culminating with the Tour Championship, which begins Sept. 13 in Atlanta. “As I have said all along, my intention was to compete in all four events, including the Barclays Classic,” Woods said yesterday on his Web site, tigerwoods.com. “But the truth is, I’m just not ready. “Playing the two weeks in the heat and humidity were mentally and physically draining,” said Woods, referring to his victories Aug. 5 at the Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio, and last Sunday at the P.G.A. Championship in Tulsa, Okla. He added: “My body is spent and I need a short break. Major championships are grueling experiences and usually necessitate recovery time.” Ty Votaw, the PGA Tour’s executive vice president for communications and international affairs, said in a statement: “We’re disappointed that Tiger will not be playing the Barclays next week. It’s clear from Tiger’s statement he remains focused on winning the FedEx Cup. Whether he can do it will be one of the many exciting things our fans will be following over the next four weeks.” Coming off back-to-back victories, Woods seemed poised to elevate the profile of the Barclays tournament and help shepherd the first steps of the FedEx Cup playoffs. The Tour designed the playoffs to bring the game’s best players together more often while also giving the season a more meaningful finish after the P.G.A. Championship. After the Barclays tournament  which is expected to have 139 players in the field  the top 120 players in the playoff’s points standings will move on to the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton, Mass., starting Aug. 31. The top 70 will advance to the BMW Championship in Lemont, Ill., which begins Sept. 6, and the top 30 will compete for a $10 million first-place annuity in the Tour Championship. By skipping the tournament, Woods could fall anywhere between third and fifth place in the points standings. This is not the first time Woods has missed the Barclays, which has often been played the week before or the week after the United States Open. Since turning professional, Woods has only played at the Barclays three times  in 1997, 2001 and 2003. “It’s disappointing, but we’ll have 139 of the top 144 guys here competing,” Peter Mele, the Barclays’ executive director, said yesterday in a telephone interview. “It gives other guys the chance to have a leg up on it. If he had home-field advantage, I think he just gave it up.” Mele said ticket sales remained strong even as word spread that Woods would not participate. “I was curious what the response would be,” Mele said. “I’ve been speaking with the people answering the phones, and it hasn’t been a deterrent at all. I think people are excited about these great players playing for something that’s different. “It will be the best field this tournament has had,” he said. “We expected better, but it’s still the best we’ve had. If you go to a playoff game and the quarterback gets hurt, you don’t cancel the game. The other guys still play.” More Articles in Sports »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/business/25tax.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Paulson Says U.S. Hurt by High Tax Rates<date>Published: July 25, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, July 24  Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. wants people to know that the corporate tax code is hurting American competitiveness. But corporate lobbyists are not expecting him to do anything about it. Skip to next paragraph Stefan Zaklin/European Pressphoto Agency Henry M. Paulson Jr. lowered his ambitions on a range of issues. On Thursday, Mr. Paulson will convene a conference to drive home the point that American corporate tax rates are higher and more complex than in Europe, Japan and most industrialized countries. Participants will include Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve; Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research; and Frederick W. Smith, chairman of the FedEx Corporation. In a report prepared for the conference, the Treasury Department said that American companies are hobbled by high tax rates, instances of double taxation and a bewildering patchwork of rules for special interests. Our tax system disrupts and distorts a vast array of business and investment decisions, the Treasury Department said. That, it said, lowers the productive capacity of the economy and reduces living standards. But Treasury officials say they are not planning any legislation. Indeed, tax reform disappeared from President Bushs agenda almost two years ago, after he became bogged down in a failed campaign to overhaul Social Security. In October 2005, after months of work, Mr. Bushs handpicked advisory panel delivered two comprehensive proposals to make the entire tax code simpler, fairer and more efficient. But administration officials immediately buried the recommendations, and Mr. Bush never came out with a plan of his own. Corporate tax lobbyists say the prospects for action are far lower today, given Mr. Bushs low popularity, the Democratic majorities in Congress and the fact that none of Mr. Bushs tax cuts expire until 2010. Given the environment were operating in, and given the fact that the only real deadline for action on a broad basis is the end of 2009, its inconceivable that anything could be enacted between now and the end of the administration, said Kenneth Kies, a corporate tax lobbyist and former Republican staff director on the House Ways and Means Committee. Treasury officials say their immediate goal is simply to highlight the need for change and set the stage for future debates. The conference is focused on examining business taxes and how they affect competitiveness, said Andrew DeSouza, a Treasury spokesman. If there are next steps, that would come after the conference. Some Republicans theorize Mr. Paulson may be trying to head off Democratic attempts to raise taxes on private equity funds, oil companies and other businesses. I think hes pushing back against the Democrats, said Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group. But others say Mr. Paulson is simply trying to look busy. Mr. Paulson has already lowered his ambitions on a range of other issues. When he took office in June 2006, he talked about working with Democratic lawmakers to address looming shortfalls in entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. But his discussions with Democrats, though cordial, went nowhere. The White House squelched any talk of tax increases to fill the shortfalls and ignored Democrats demands that Mr. Bush abandon his push for letting people put some of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts. Earlier this year, Mr. Paulson admitted that making progress on entitlement programs was more difficult than he had expected. Nor did Mr. Paulson have much success on an initiative to relax securities regulations that Wall Street firms said were making it harder for American stock exchanges to compete with foreign stock exchanges. Under the circumstances, veterans of past tax battles in Congress say Mr. Paulson is doing as much as he can. Put yourself in the shoes of someone like Paulson  what are you going to do? said C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who worked on tax policy at the Treasury Department under President Ronald Reagan. Theyre not getting any traction on health. Theyre not getting any traction on Social Security. The best thing they can do is go ahead with studying the issues in a bipartisan way. Mr. Paulsons conference will have a bipartisan feel. Though many participants are well-known Republicans, like Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Feldstein, the list also includes prominent critics of Mr. Bushs tax policies like William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution and Alan J. Auerbach, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. I dont know what they want from me, but I expect they want it to be short, Mr. Auerbach said in a telephone interview. There are a lot of speakers. In its background report for the conference, the Treasury Department noted that the top corporate tax rate, including state taxes, is 39 percent  significantly higher than the average of 31 percent for other industrialized nations. If Congress were to strip out the thousands of special tax breaks for everything from domestic manufacturing and oil drilling to technology research, Treasury officials estimated that the top rate could be reduced to just 27 percent. But Congress has shown little appetite for that kind of trade-off, which was at the heart of the last major tax overhaul in 1986. It is not clear how long Mr. Paulson will dwell on the issue. The day after his conference, he heads to China for more talks about currency flexibility.

Embraces High-Tech Delivery Methods<date>Published: July 12, 2007</date><text>Correction Appended LOUISVILLE, Ky.  Worldport, the United Parcel Service hub at the airport here, gives new meaning to the phrase hub of activity. On a peak night, workers have less than four hours to process more than a million packages from at least 100 planes and probably 160 trucks. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Geoff Oliver Bugbee for The New York Times Helena Grinestaff working on a small sort line. Yes, the ubiquitous brown trucks, with their brown-clad drivers, are the face that U.P.S. presents to the world. But increasingly, it is the researchers at its Atlanta headquarters, its technology center in Mahwah, N.J., and its huge four-million-square-foot Louisville hub who are asking the questions that will drive the companys future. What if the package contains medicine that could turn from palliative to poison if the temperature wavers? What if it is moving from Bangkok to Bangor and back to Bangkok, and if customs rules differ on each end? And what if the package is going to a big company that insists on receiving all its packages, no matter who ships them, at the same time each day? Increasingly, it is the search for high-tech answers to such questions that is occupying the entire package delivery industry. U.P.S. and FedEx are each pumping more than $1 billion a year into research, while also looking for new ways to cut costs. When you handle millions of packages, a minutes delay can cost a fortune, said John Kartsonas, an analyst with Citigroup. Information technology has become essential. Customers of both FedEx and U.P.S. can now print out shipping labels that are easily scannable by computers. Meteorologists at both companies routinely outguess official Weather Service forecasts. And both are working with the Federal Aviation Administration to improve air safety and scheduling. U.P.S. specifically is collaborating with the F.A.A. on a system  formally, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, but usually just called A.D.S.B.  that may make conventional radar obsolete. We want to make A.D.S.B. the backbone of our future air traffic system, said Vincent Capezzuto, the manager of the program for the F.A.A. The research at U.P.S. is paying off. Last year, it cut 28 million miles from truck routes  saving roughly three million gallons of fuel  in good part by mapping routes that minimize left turns. This year, U.P.S. began offering customers a self-service system for redirecting packages that are en route. And now the U.P.S. researchers are working on sensors that can track temperatures of packages, on software that can make customs checks more uniform worldwide and on scheduling processes that accommodate the needs of recipients as well as shippers. Recipients do not pay U.P.S., but they sure influence which carriers their suppliers use, David A. Barnes, the chief information officer, said. U.P.S. has the most at stake in the technological race. It handles an average of 15.7 million packages a day, more than twice the volume of FedEx. Unlike FedEx, U.P.S. has a huge unionized work force whose salaries and benefits soak up more than half of operating revenues, so it has the most to gain from automation. U.P.S. spent more than $600 million on package flow technology, and theyll recoup it and more over the next few years, said Ken Hoexter, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Every tidbit of package information, from size to destination to special handling needs, is embedded in those customer-generated scannable labels. That alone has enabled U.P.S. to offer premium-price early delivery in many more ZIP codes. And it has reduced the chaos that human error once caused drivers. Even the most seasoned loaders messed up sometimes, jumbling the packages, forgetting to list stops or setting up a schedule that made drivers retrace their steps. And when your regular loader was on vacation, you were really in trouble, recalled Mark Casey, a U.P.S. driver. Now the computer tells loaders what goes where. A hand-held device does the same for Mr. Casey. It also flags special requirements, like the need for an adults signature. It warns him if he must deviate from the route to make a timely delivery, or to accommodate a change in a packages destination. Mr. Casey said the system lets him drive fewer miles, yet make more stops. For U.P.S., it offers another bonus. It is much easier to train loaders, because the job has been deskilled, said Roger Hicks, a business manager at the package center. Conversely, though, jobs have grown more complicated at the Global Operations Center, the focal point for the airline side of U.P.S.s business. People there now schedule some 600 owned and chartered planes and crews around the globe each day. They also set up 11 spares, which can pick up packages trucked in from a fogbound airport, or pinch hit for a plane with mechanical problems. There arent many nights when we dont launch at least one, said Scott E. Warner, contingency shift manager for U.P.S. Airlines. The necessary coordination is formidable.

The company forecast earnings growth in fiscal year 2008 below the companys long-term target of 10 percent to 15 percent, in part because of planned investments for the companys long-term health. But FedEx said its own economists predicted a bit of an economic upturn later this year. A weakened U.S. market is limiting demand for transportation services, but we expect the economy to show modest, year-to-year improvement beginning in late summer or early fall, FedExs president and chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said in a conference call. FedEx shares rose $1.74, to $109.80. FedEx reported earnings of $610 million, or $1.96 a share, for the three months ended May 31, up from $568 million, or $1.82 a share, a year ago. The latest results included a gain of 6 cents a share from a settlement with Airbus after an order cancellation for A380 aircraft. Without the gain, the company earned $1.90 a share for the quarter. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $9.15 billion, from $8.49 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were looking for a profit of $1.95 a share on revenue of $9.16 billion. FedEx had predicted it would earn $1.93 to $2.08 a share, including the gain on the Airbus settlement. For all of fiscal 2007, FedEx earned $2.02 billion, or $6.48 a share, up from $1.81 billion, or $5.83 a share, the previous year. Revenue rose to $35.2 billion from $32.3 billion a year earlier. American businesses have drawn down inventories for several financial quarters, Mr. Smith said, but FedEx expects that to begin turning around soon. Obviously, the big wild card in this whole thing is the price of fuel, he said. You cant take hundreds of billions of dollars out of the U.S. consumers pocket  which are then not recycled through our economy  and not have it have an effect. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/business/05kinkos.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Paper Jam at FedEx Kinko’s<date>Published: May 5, 2007</date><text>DALLAS  Tag along and marvel as Kenneth A. May, the chief executive of FedEx Kinkos, works a roomful of employees. Skip to next paragraph Illustration by The New York Times Hows your dad? he knowingly asks a young woman whose father just had surgery. Hows your rock band coming? the manager of a Dallas store hears. Hi, my name is Ken, we havent met, he says to a new hire at another store, extending his hand. The employees seem genuinely glad to banter with him. One could almost think that the integration of Kinkos into FedEx is going off without a hitch. It is not. Profit margins at Kinkos have fallen, revenue has barely grown and employee turnover, which was 42 percent in 2005, was still a daunting 27 percent last year. Paul Orfalea, who was nicknamed Kinko for the full head of curly black hair he sported in 1970 when he founded the company  originally to serve students at the University of California, Santa Barbara  says he will not step inside the stores now. It gives me a stomachache to see whats happened to the place, Mr. Orfalea, now balding, said. But what, actually, has happened? It depends on who is talking. Indeed, the tale of Kinkos metamorphosis from a free-wheeling group of copy centers to a buttoned-down subsidiary of FedEx plays like a corporate version of the classic Japanese movie Rashômon. To a customer wandering through FedEx Kinkos stores, it feels pretty much like business as usual. But delve a bit deeper, and this merger could serve as a case study of the problems that crop up when companies with synergistic strategies but wildly disparate cultures try to meld. No one disputes the facts. Mr. Orfalea expanded Kinkos through partnerships. He sold a large stake to Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, a private equity firm, in 1996. Then, in 2003, Clayton sold Kinkos to FedEx, which is turning the stores into one-stop shops for shipping packages, printing and mailing brochures or sending data over computers. But there, the agreement ends. Some say Clayton, Dubilier massacred Kinkos, and that FedEx can never repair the damage. Others say Clayton added discipline to the 60s-style Kinkos atmosphere, and that FedEx is continuing that process. Weve got three cultures at play here, said Brian D. Philips, Fedex Kinkos chief operating officer. But most see cultures at war. At Kinkos, theres a thin veneer of professional folks riding herd on a vast platoon of semitrained people, said James E. Schrager, clinical professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. Thats just not the FedEx way. A result, said Robert Boyden Lamb, a management professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, is that these cultures do not gel, they do not hook together at key points. Even Mr. May, who has been with FedEx for 24 years and has run FedEx Kinkos for two, acknowledges the vast gulf. Kinkos was a way station where you stayed a few years, but you build a career at FedEx, he said. The Kinkos people are hip, theyre fun, but they needed oversight. Kinkos workers, many of whom still tell tales of the annual picnics Mr. Orfalea gave for co-workers (he hated the word employee), describe an entirely different situation. Kinkos coddled its workers, they say, who in turn coddled customers. I had cornrows and green hair, and no one seemed to mind, recalled Sharon A. Robinson, once a worker at a Kinkos in Laramie, Wyo., and now a product specialist. Employees speak of carnage under Clayton, Dubilier  of slashed training, mass firings, store closings and policies that discouraged helping customers in any way but by the book. They killed our culture, said Kayt A. Schaefer, a documentation specialist at FedEx Kinkos. Clayton saw it as necessary euthanasia, not murder. It was the Peoples Republic of Kinkos, a place where store managers thumbed their noses at corporate and ran the stores as they saw fit, said Gary M. Kusin, a retailer who was recruited by Clayton to run Kinkos in August 2001. That became troublesome as Kinkos began seeking corporate business. Customers could not count on getting the same thing at different stores, said Jon Cannon, who opened a Kinkos in 1992 and is now a senior vice president at FedEx Kinkos. Mr. Orfalea concedes the point. Headquarters was operating like a cooperative, he said. So he and his partners sold 30 percent of the company to Clayton, Dubilier. Clayton formed a central organization, and proceeded to do what buyout firms do best  cut costs, streamline operations, and groom Kinkos to go public. But it went too far, in Mr. Orfaleas view. I told them that our biggest asset was the sparkle in our peoples eyes, he said. But they threw away senior people like garbage. Clayton, Dubilier centralized procurement and put in stricter controls, requiring store managers to get permission to try anything new. They just stifled us, Ms. Robinson said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/business/12fedex.html?ref=fedexcorporation">FedEx Settles Racial Discrimination Suit<date>Published: April 12, 2007</date><text>CHICAGO, April 11 (Reuters)  The package delivery company FedEx said on Wednesday that it had agreed to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit against its express unit, FedEx Express, for $53.5 million. The suit, filed in 2003, charged that FedEx Express discriminated against its African-American and Hispanic workers by passing them over for promotion, paying them less than white workers and treating them unfairly in evaluation and disciplinary proceedings. FedEx has denied committing any acts of racial discrimination. There has been no finding of wrongdoing on the part of FedEx, said a FedEx spokeswoman, Sandra A. Munoz. The $53.5 million cost of the settlement will be covered by insurance, she said. FedEx decided to settle to avoid a lengthy and costly litigation and appeals process, she added. The settlement is subject to approval by the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California. James M. Finberg, a partner at the San Francisco law firm of Altshuler Berzon, which was handling the class-action lawsuit, said that the settlement was mediated by a third party and that he was quite confident the court would approve it.

FedEx said profit slipped to $420 million, or $1.35 a share, from $428 million, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Costs for dealing with bad weather cut into profit by 6 cents a share, but that was offset by a gain of 8 cents a share related to a lower tax rate, the company said. The FedEx chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said, The U.S. economy grew at a slower rate than expected in the third quarter, and we saw continued adjustments in the automobile and housing markets. But Mr. Smith said he expected the economy to pick up, adding that FedEx is in excellent position to take full advantage of global economic growth trends. The chief financial officer, Alan Graf, said revenue growth was less than expected primarily at the express and freight divisions because of the economic slowdown. We think were in a little bit of a soft patch at the moment, Mr. Graf said. As we see revenue slowing, were simply unable to adjust our cost structure quickly enough during a quarter to make up for the lost revenue, and that had a negative impact on us. Revenue in the period, which ended Feb. 28, increased 7 percent, to $8.59 billion. from $8 billion a year earlier. FedEx warned that a slower economy could continue to affect earnings per share. Art Hatfield, an analyst at Morgan, Keegan, said the companys assessment of pressure on earnings from the overall economy was no surprise. Theyre just seeing things as we see them too, Mr. Hatfield said. They said they think things have slowed and they do expect them to get better sometime this summer. I think theyre seeing a soft-landing scenario. Dan Ortwerth, an analyst with Edward Jones &amp; Company, said a focus on creating a flexible cost structure, increasing market share and expanding globally helps FedEx weather economic slowdowns. Shares in FedEx, based in Memphis, fell $1.30, or 1.2 percent, to $110.99, then dropped 14 cents more in after-hours trading.

Net income increased to $511 million, or $1.64 a share, in the three months that ended Nov. 30, from $471 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales climbed 10 percent, to $8.93 billion. Third-quarter profit will be held down by an increase in fuel prices, the company said. FedEx’s second-quarter results provided the 12th consecutive quarterly profit increase for the company, which has not reported a loss since 1997. “They had strong growth in the second quarter,” said Jim Corridore, a Standard &amp; Poor’s analyst who rates FedEx a strong buy. “Obviously, they can’t control fuel prices. Their core business is just fine.” FedEx said third-quarter profit would be $1.20 to $1.35 a share, and fourth-quarter earnings would be $1.98 to $2.13. On average, analysts expected the company to earn $1.55 in the third quarter and $2 in the fourth, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg News. FedEx kept its full-year earnings forecast at as much as $6.65 a share. Shares of FedEx fell $2.15, or 1.9 percent, to close at $111.85. The surcharges that FedEx uses to blunt the impact of higher oil costs lag current prices by two months. The company benefited in previous quarters when fuel prices fell at a steeper rate than the surcharges. Results at FedEx and other shipping companies, including truckers and railroads, are often seen as indicators of broader economic growth or contraction. While FedEx has experienced some slowing from a year earlier, the third-quarter outlook was based solely on fuel prices, not the United Sates economy, Alan B. Graf Jr., the chief financial officer, said.

According to at least one poll last week, nearly half of all men in relationships had yet to buy gifts for their spouses. But forces of the corporate world are set to bail out shopping slackers yet again, only you wouldnt know how unless you somehow noticed that delivery trucks were making fewer left-hand turns than ever. Spurred by the growth of e-commerce, shippers like U.P.S. and others are shaving precious minutes from their delivery times by arranging shipping routes to avoid left-hand turns, among many other things. Online retailers, meanwhile, have tweaked their own product handling systems, thanks to improved technology and lessons sometimes painfully learned in years past. The result is that many online merchants this year will still sell goods with standard shipping terms through Monday, Dec. 18, or Tuesday, Dec. 19, thereby lending a hand to late holiday shoppers and, e-commerce executives hope, stealing more sales from offline merchants. Retailers and industry analysts said they expected the trend to help build sales, if not cure road rage, especially from procrastinators who in years past would have sped to the mall rather than go online and pay for expedited delivery service. Theres no question these sales are going to go right to our bottom line, because weve never been able to get the procrastinators, said Shmuel Gniwisch, chief executive of the online jeweler Ice.com, which pushed its standard shipping cut-off date closer to Christmas by one day this year, offering free two-day FedEx shipping for orders placed by noon on Dec. 20. They always went to the store. According to a poll by BizRate, a division of E. W. Scripps, 30 of 76 Internet retailers said they would guarantee standard shipping for orders placed by Dec. 18 or 19. That is double the number from last year, but the shift is even more profound, since in 2005 there were four business days between Dec. 19 and Christmas, versus three this year. A few years ago, such promises may not have made much difference to consumers, who had fresh memories of late packages from ToysRUs.com, Macys.com and others back in 1999. But retailers have managed to deliver packages on time since then, even while pushing their shipping deadlines closer to Christmas. Consumers are forgetting the fiascos of 1999 and are starting to replace those with positive experiences, said John Chandler-Pepelnjak, an analyst with Atlas, an online marketing technology company. Theyre brushing up against the tightest boundaries now, and they still have a reasonable expectation of getting their gifts. Mr. Chandler-Pepelnjak said that last year the peak online shopping day was Dec. 13, whereas in 2000 the peak came on the day after Thanksgiving. Another factor that could spur late sales this year, he added, was the propensity of consumers to shop online on Mondays and Tuesdays. I think people will do a lot of shopping on the 18th and 19th this year, he said. Although to me, thats cutting it close. John Thompson, a senior vice president at BestBuy.com, said his company had improved its own shipping acumen, and had also benefited from better coordination with U.P.S. As a result, he said, BestBuy.com had extended its holiday shopping deadline by one day for each of the last four years. The Friday after Thanksgiving was a huge day for us, and because we share forecast information with U.P.S., we knew we had the right size trucks  and enough of them  outside our facilities, he said. That was huge, and it worked as well as we couldve hoped. Among other things, Mr. Thompson said, BestBuy had gotten better at predicting the most popular items of the holiday season for various regions, and making sure those items were adequately stocked and ready for shipment from the closest distribution centers. Norman Black, a U.P.S. spokesman, said the company had become more efficient in its own right, announcing in March a new routing system that reduced by one day the average transit time for many popular routes. That technology system is a refinement of one introduced last year, that, among other things, reduced the number of left-hand turns encountered by drivers. Were aggressively trying each year to do more and more for our customers, largely because of e-commerce, Mr. Black said. As we do, and as our competitors do, customers start to trust you more and more, and that shows up in something as mundane as the date of the last recommended shopping day. FedEx has also improved its efficiency, said Mike Mannion, a senior vice president of FedEx Ground. Over the last three years, he said, the company had reduced by one day the time to ship a package across most of its routes. The company has added shipping facilities in major cities, allowing employees in Cleveland, for instance, to load Orlando-bound packages on a trailer bound directly for that city. In the past, packages from Cleveland would have been collected in Columbus, then put on trucks to Orlando. Increased volume has helped justify such expenses, Mr. Mannion said. In fiscal year 2006, FedEx Ground shipped more than 2.81 million packages daily, 8 percent more than the previous year. U.P.S., meanwhile, shipped 6.6 percent more packages during the first nine months of this year than during the same period last year. Mr. Gniwisch of Ice.com said the later shipping deadlines would help the company cater especially to men, who tended to shop later than women, and spend more. (Ice.com polled 400 of its customers last Tuesday and found that 46 percent of men who were in relationships had yet to buy a gift for their partners.) Ice.com this year had a comparatively conservative shipping deadline, of midnight Dec. 14, for those who chose free United States Postal Service delivery. But Mr. Gniwisch said the company was pushing it to the limit this year by offering two-day FedEx delivery for orders placed before noon on Dec. 20. In part, Mr. Gniwisch said, that was because his company reduced the amount of time required to processes an order this year, from 6 hours to 2.5 hours. Two years ago, it took 26 hours to process an order. Everybody gets better at this the longer you stay in business, Mr. Gniwisch said. You work out the kinks. More Articles in Technology »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/business/worldbusiness/13energy.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Executives Urge Action to Cut Dependence on Foreign Oil<date>Published: December 13, 2006</date><text>WASHINGTON, Dec. 12  More than a dozen prominent business executives and retired military officers, including the chairman of FedEx and a former commandant of the Marine Corps, are lobbying Congress and the White House to undertake a comprehensive campaign to reduce reliance on imported oil. Skip to next paragraph Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times Frederick W. Smith, the founder and chief executive of FedEx, is part of a group that wants much tougher fuel economy standards for vehicles. The group, which includes top executives from the chemical, trucking and airline industries, wants much tougher fuel economy standards, not only on cars and sport utility vehicles, but also on heavy trucks, which some of the companies use. They want increased drilling offshore and within the United States, a much harder push for ethanol and other biofuels, and other changes that would permanently reduce the importance of oil as a strategic commodity and an economic force. While the group, called the Energy Security Leadership Council, has embraced no startling new ideas, it hopes that evidence of broad support from business and military leaders will add the weight needed to get its proposals adopted. Energy policy is in almost perfect gridlock, Frederick W. Smith, the founder and chief executive of FedEx, who is co-chairman of the group, said in a telephone interview. Its the height of folly for the U.S. to continue on this course, lest we have some major economic or national security problem. Something has to get done. The group plans to release a details on Wednesday, to start a television and print ad campaign and to begin meeting with Congressional leaders and White House officials. The other co-chairman is Gen. P. X. Kelley, a retired commandant of the Marines. Also on board are top executives of Dow Chemical, Waste Management and Southwest Airlines; a former Navy secretary; and the Air Force chief of staff. Among the proposals is a 4 percent annual increase in fuel economy covering vehicles up to 10,000 pounds, substantially larger than those now covered by the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standard. It would allow delays in improvements if 4 percent was technically infeasible, unsafe or not cost-effective for a given year. Although the current standard for light trucks has a similar escape clause, the Transportation Department has nonetheless required only small improvements in fuel economy. Mr. Smith noted that American energy consumption was successfully reduced after the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, although some of the steps taken then cannot be repeated, like large-scale substitution of natural gas for oil and replacing or converting most oil-fueled electric power plants to other fuels. The report also recommends recruiting other countries that rely on imported oil to help defend oil operations around the world. But it rejected the concept of energy independence in favor of a goal of reducing the amount of oil per unit of economic output. There is broad consensus that the country should rely less on imports  President Bush, in his last State of the Union speech, said that America was addicted to oil  but Congress has taken no steps toward that goal. Even before the unveiling of the plan, the organizers have lined up generalized support, if not specific endorsement, from elected officials. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat who will be the House majority leader in the new Congress, said, When prominent C.E.O.s and military leaders get together to advocate an issue as important as energy security, people listen. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who won re-election this fall as an independent, said the panels composition had made him sit up and take notice. Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said he welcomed the report. Our nation is becoming increasingly dependent on energy resources that are concentrated in places that are either hostile to American interests or vulnerable to political upheaval and terrorism, he said. I commend the council for speaking candidly about these dangers. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/11/business/11five.html?ref=fedexcorporation">Jobs of Investment Bankers Appear to Be Safe<date>Published: November 11, 2006</date><text>EVEN more than usual, it was a good week to be an investment banker.

DEALS A GO-GO Companies that make everything from steaks to forklifts or provide services like hotel rooms and trucking were all on the market this week, in a mergers-and-acquisition bonanza among small and midsize companies. A pair of private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, offered 4 billion euros ($5.1 billion) to buy the forklift-making operations of Linde of Germany, a maker of industrial gases and machinery. Private equity investors also swooped down on the Outback Steakhouse casual-dining chain, with Bain Capital and Catterton Partners agreeing to buy the company for $3.2 billion, one of the biggest restaurant deals ever. Abbott Laboratories agreed to $3.7 billion for a smaller prescription drug maker, Kos Pharmaceuticals, which makes Niaspan, a fast-selling drug that raises the level of good cholesterol, or HDL, in people at risk of heart disease. Backed by investment financing from Bill Gates of Microsoft and Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, the chief executive of the Four Seasons Hotels chain, Isadore Sharp, offered to buy the company from its shareholders for $3.7 billion in cash. A former chief executive of Swift Transportation, Jerry Moyes, put in a bid for his former employer, a trucking company, offering about $2.2 billion. If the past is any indication, more deals are likely soon. More than $3.2 trillion worth of mergers and acquisitions have been announced around the world so far this year, compared with $2.4 trillion in 2005, according to Dealogic. NEXT UP? A day after the popular editor of The Los Angeles Times stepped down rather than make further money-saving cuts to his staff, two Los Angeles billionaires, Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, jointly offered to buy the newspaper  and the nationwide media corporation that owns it. Details of the bid were not made public, but the target, the Tribune Company, has a market capitalization of almost $8 billion. In addition to The Los Angeles Times  its biggest property and the nations fourth-largest newspaper  the company, which is based in Chicago, also owns 10 other daily newspapers, more than two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs. Losing the editor, Dean Baquet, was seen by some people in Los Angeles as a sign that Tribune was willing to sacrifice the papers quality for bigger profits. It certainly was indicative of tumult in the industry, coming just a day before Amanda Bennett was forced out as editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer. A third Los Angeles billionaire, the film and music mogul David Geffen, may make his own bid for the Los Angeles newspaper. SURE WINNERS Whether all of these deals eventually work out for the buyers, they have already produced big gains for the investment bankers who are arranging the transactions. Annual bonuses on Wall Street this year are forecast to rise 10 to 15 percent from 2005, according to Alan Johnson Associates, an executive compensation consultant. Investment bankers, who advise corporations on mergers and financing, are expected to experience the biggest percentage jump, about 20 to 25 percent this year. Traders, who invest their firms own capital, will make even more, as much as $40 million to $50 million, Wall Street executives say. Abundant global capital and rapid international growth will keep salaries and bonuses high for years, analysts said. THE BAD NEWS Flush times for traders, however, does not necessarily mean as much for the people who execute trades for them. The New York Stock Exchange said it would cut more than 500 jobs, or 17 percent of its staff, from now to next March. The exchange, which is moving toward more electronic trading, recently said it would close one of its five trading floors in downtown Manhattan as part of that shift. Coincidentally, the exchange, which became a public company in March, is seeking to reduce its overhead costs by $200 million. Analysts expect more cuts, saying the Big Board has excess staff, compared with its rivals. TOO LATE Citing production delays dogging the Airbus double-deck A380 airliner, the FedEx Corporation canceled its order for 10 cargo versions of the huge aircraft and in their place ordered 15 Boeing 777 freighters and took options on 15 more. Airbus recently said problems with wiring and other production processes would delay the delivery of A380s by as much as two years, twice as long as initial estimates. FedEx is the only customer so far to cancel an order for the giant aircraft. Airbus representatives are canvassing other customers to see whether they, too, are considering canceling orders, and how to dissuade them from doing so. TOO SLOW Amid criticism that he has been too slow to curb labor costs by cutting jobs and extending the typical employees workweek, Bernd Pischetsrieder was forced out as chief executive of Volkswagen, Europes biggest automaker. Although VWs board extended Mr. Pischetsrieders contract for five years just last May, the chairman, Ferdinand K. Piëch, remained hostile to Mr. Pischetsrieder, saying he had lost the support of employees. Volkswagens board will meet on Friday to choose Mr. Pischetsrieders successor. Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of VWs Audi division, is the leading candidate. BRIGHT SPOT While much of the worlds automobile industry struggles with falling sales or mounting losses, Toyota said its profit surged more than 33 percent in the three months through September, driven by strong sales in the United States and Europe. In the quarter, Toyota said it made a profit of $3.4 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the period last year.

Industrial companies climbed after Emerson Electric, the maker of power equipment for utilities and oil producers, reported a 26 percent increase in quarterly profit. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 51.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,156.77, with Boeing accounting for more than two-thirds of the measures advance. The Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index rose 3.06 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,382.84. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 9.93 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,375.88. Computer chip makers supported the Nasdaq after Altera, a maker of programmable semiconductors, reported a higher profit. The market has had two terrific days celebrating what it sees as gridlock, said Steven C. Leuthold, who oversees $2.7 billion as chief investment officer of Leuthold Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis. In the past, such deadlocks have pretty much put a damper on spending because the two parties cant agree on anything, he said. A divided federal government helped the market in the last decade. The S.&amp; P. 500 tripled from 1995 until 2000, when President Bush won the presidency and Republicans held control of both houses. The longer-term picture is not as clear. An analysis of financial market returns from 1949 to 2004 shows that equity investors fared a bit worse during periods of divided government than when one party held power, according to a paper by professors Scott Beyer of the University of Wisconsin and Gerald R. Jensen of Northern Illinois University, and Robert R. Johnson, managing director of the CFA Institute in Virginia. Boeing rallied $4.37, or 5.4 percent, to $84.85. FedEx scrapped an order for 10 Airbus A380 aircraft and switched to Boeing 777 jets, the first cancellation as a result of repeated production delays at Airbus. Emerson gained $4.87, or 5.9 percent, to $87.43, for the second-biggest advance in the S.&amp; P. 500. Net income last quarter was $1.29 a share, more than the average analyst estimate of $1.20, according to Thomson Financial. Emerson also declared its first stock split in nine years. Altera climbed 88 cents, to $19.32, after reporting a 12 percent increase in net income on rising sales of chips used in communications equipment. Broadcom, a maker of chips for consumer devices, rallied $1.73, to $31.98. Cisco Systems, which reports earnings today, added 16 cents, to $24.84. UBS increased its price forecast for shares of Cisco, which makes computer networking equipment, by 13 percent, to $27. Crude oil settled down $1.09 at $58.93 a barrel, on speculation that domestic inventories rose last week and doubts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would make promised output cuts. In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 10122/32. The notes yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.66 percent, from 4.7 percent on Monday.

The order will instead go to its American rival Boeing, which will supply FedEx with 15 Boeing 777 freighters, a plane also designed for long-haul cargo flights. Frederick W. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of FedEx, faced with a rapidly growing cargo market, cited Airbuss recent decision to delay delivery of the superjumbo jet for at least two years as the reason for shifting its order to Boeing. This is a watershed event, said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst with Jeffries &amp; Company. FedEx was meticulous, thoughtful and analytical when they made their decision to buy the A380. They are an ideal lead customer, and for them to turn around in relatively short time and pull out is a stunning reversal. Mr. Rubel noted that this was the first time in a decade that FedEx would buy new Boeing planes. One reason, he suggested, was Boeings ability to deliver the 777 as early as 2009, as well as the flexibility of the twin-engine long-haul plane for many different routes. FedEx also dropped its options for the purchase of 10 A380s at an unspecified date in the future. The cancellation goes beyond a dollar loss. Because FedEx has a reputation for careful decision-making, the switch bolsters the reputation of the 777 at a time when the market for long-haul international cargo planes is growing faster than the international passenger market. Its like the 777 just got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, Mr. Rubel added. Until FedEx abandoned the A380, Airbus had 159 firm orders for the plane. Far more orders are needed for Airbus to break even, much less earn profits. In the past, Airbus has said it expected to sell about 750 planes  the A380 will be the largest commercial jet ever built, seating at least 555 passengers  during the life of the program. The value of the FedEx contract for Airbus was confidential, but the passenger version of the A380 lists for about $300 million. Airbus may not lose as much as $3 billion in revenues from the order, though; freighters sell for less because their interiors are not as elaborate. Moreover, the FedEx order was placed at rates that would have prevailed in 2001, an Airbus spokeswoman, Barbara Kracht, said. Other customers could follow FedExs lead, however. Virgin Atlantic Airways, another major customer, said less than two weeks ago that it was postponing for four years its order for six Airbus A380s, making it the first airline to step back from its commitment. Airbus has also been jousting with its largest customer, Emirates Airlines, which last month sent teams to Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany, the main Airbus production sites, to look into its orders for 43 planes. A second team of Emirates engineers is expected to arrive in Toulouse later this month to study the progress of A380s there. Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of Airline Monitor, a commercial aviation trade publication, said he doubted other airliners would follow suit. Mr. Greenslet pointed to the decision late last month by Qantas Airways of Australia to convert its options to purchase eight A380s into firm orders. I dont think that this will start a landslide and cause other airlines to say, Well, if FedEx is canceling, I will, too,  said Mr. Greenslet. Other airlines have made their own judgment and are basically committed to the plane. The cancellation by FedEx means that Airbus now has outstanding orders for just 15 freighter versions of the A380. United Parcel Service ordered 10 A380s in 2005 and has options to buy 10 more. The remaining five will go to the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing company based in California. A spokesman for U.P.S., Mark Giuffre, said that the company was in regular contact with Airbus about its A380 orders and had yet to make a final decision about whether to modify or cancel them. U.P.S., which had originally expected to receive its first A380 in September 2009 has been told by Airbus that the first delivery will not be made before the middle of 2010. We are asking for more detailed information from Airbus before making any decisions, said Mr. Giuffre. We are not making any changes to our order for now, but as a business, we have to be prudent in making sure that we can meet the needs of our customers over the long term. Airbus announced its first delay for the A380 last year, because of problems with wiring in the planes built at its factory in Germany. In June, Airbus announced another delay and appointed a new chief executive, who then stepped down in October. He had begun laying the groundwork for a cost-cutting program aimed at shaving 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) from annual costs. To achieve that goal, Airbus plans to reduce the number of suppliers it uses to 500, from 3,000, though that shift will affect general procurement of things like office supplies and furniture rather than aircraft parts. Thousands of jobs are also at stake. With Airbus in the deepest crisis of its 36-year history, some analysts say it will be difficult for the company to obtain many more new orders for the A380. Airbus, the main subsidiary of the European Aeronautic, Space and Defense Company, said it regretted the FedEx decision. That said, we respect their need to address capacity growth, an Airbus spokesman, David Voskuhl, said. Boeing, meanwhile, enjoys new success for its 777, the worlds longest-range twin engine aircraft. It will replace FedExs aging fleet of McDonnell Douglas-11F cargo jets. Ray Conner, vice president of sales for the Americas at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said, Were looking forward to working with FedEx on this new chapter in our relationship. Carter Doughtery reported from Frankfurt and Leslie Wayne from New York.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic U.P.S. Stretches Enlarge This Image Steve Kagan for The New York Times FLEXIBLE WORK FORCE Doug Lamb, front, leads a U.P.S. stretch. He is the package delivery man and he has played into commercials, been romantically dissected in blogs and even made a cameo on Sex and the City. He is an Adonis, greeted at stops by adoring onlookers. But for all the perks of his job, there is a grim physical reality. Hundreds of packages a day. Endless stairs. Lifting, carrying, shifting and balancing, for nine or more hours a day in the slow season and many more in the holiday season. This, in fact, is the time of the year when U.P.S. and FedEx drivers and postal workers are consumed with getting into shape to handle the deluge that comes at the end of every year. Its not about buff, cut, chiseled. Its about health, fitness, strength. And its not just delivery men. Some blue-collar workers, including landscapers and construction laborers, have taken a newfound interest in their physical health. How else to handle their demanding days without being injured? Personally, I work out three to four times a week in the morning before I go to work, for about an hour, said Doug Lamb, 49, a U.P.S. driver in San Francisco. I know for a fact that it helps me with my job. It used to be that workers suffered the aches and pains of their labor as mere occupational hazards. They werent compelled to work out after hours, guzzle Gatorade on the clock or stretch before starting their day. But today, a growing number of men and women whose jobs are unrelenting marathons of exertion have realized that they have more in common with professional athletes than deskbound professionals. Employers  eager to prevent injuries that strain the bottom line  are promoting improved health by hiring on-site athletic trainers, encouraging employee exercise routines and approaching workers as industrial athletes. Increasingly employers are using a smaller permanent work force, and theyre trying to keep everybody at the wheel as much as possible, said Tom Juravich, a professor of labor studies at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Meanwhile, he said, laborers are realizing that demands today are quite high, and that to survive this, theyre going to actually have to start thinking outside the box. For John Dock, a letter carrier with the Postal Service, that means stretching regularly and making sure to carry ice-cold Gatorade for the eight hours a day that he is on his feet. If youre not fit, how are you going to be able to perform? said Mr. Dock, 47, based in Mahwah, N.J. If your health is run down and youre calling in sick because your resistance is low, how can you be a team player? To be able to run up flights of stairs with a hundred pounds of roofing material on his back, John Entrekin, a self-employed contractor in Cherry Hill, N.J., hired a personal trainer. Several nights a week, he undergoes a cross-training regimen at a branch of Velocity Sports Performance, a nationwide personal-training facility. Im at the point where I need to stay in shape to maintain a certain output, workwise, said Mr. Entrekin, 51. When I was in my prime, I could nail 14 squares a day. Now Im happy with 6. (One roofing square is equal to 100 square feet.) The more fit they are, laborers say, the less exhausted they are after their shifts. It has helped me in terms of making it through the week and still having enough energy to do other things, Mr. Lamb said. Some employers are also doing their part. The post office and companies like FedEx hire athletic trainers to develop exercise routines for employees, give them pointers on what to eat and pinpoint ergonomic risks. (For example, athletic trainers with degrees in biomechanics and kinesiology watch delivery people lift boxes to correct their form.) Debbie Maclean, an athletic trainer, developed an injury-prevention program for Coca-Cola drivers and plant workers called Back @ Work. In annual seminars, employees are given instruction, using DVDs and a personal trainer, about proper body mechanics. They are also taught a stretching routine designed to be done at five-minute intervals throughout each workday. Research has shown that stretching in itself doesnt prevent injury that day, Ms. Maclean said. It is increasing flexibility over time, she said, that can reduce the likelihood of injury. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Fashion &amp; Style »</text></article></page></root>
