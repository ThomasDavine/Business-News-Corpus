The company affirmed its outlook for record 2011 results.Its shares slid nearly 2 percent with the pace of consumer holiday demand still in question. The company said third-quarter net income rose to $1.04 billion, or $1.06 a share, compared with $991 million, or 99 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.05 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 18 percent, to $13.17 billion, matching analysts’ forecasts. The United States economy appears to have stabilized and is growing slowly after concern about a possible double-dip recession stifled consumer demand earlier this year, U.P.S. said. “Their tone was clearly more positive than it was last quarter, but make no bones about it, there’s still some uncertainty,” said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond, Va. The company is well positioned to handle a run-up in volume from customers with lean inventories ahead of the peak holiday season, analysts said. The final two weeks before Christmas could have a meaningful effect on fourth-quarter results if consumer demand picks up and retailers low on inventory need fast shipment of goods, the company’s chief executive, Scott Davis, told analysts on a conference call. “Over the last month or so, we are starting to see, I could say, better economic numbers, so there is more optimism out there, and that could turn things around,” Mr. Davis said. “We are still expecting a slow-growth economy, but I don’t think it is as negative as people were thinking two and three months ago.” The company’s shares fell 2 percent, to $69.35. U.P.S. has forecast record earnings of $4.15 to $4.40 a share this year as it cut costs and raised shipping rates. U.P.S. and FedEx are considered economic bellwethers because of the enormous volume of packages they handle. The value of packages handled by U.P.S.’s trucks and planes each year is equivalent to about 6 percent of United States gross domestic product and 2 percent of global G.D.P. Domestic shipping volume averaged 12.74 million packages a day, little changed from 12.73 million a year ago.United Parcel Service reported a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as increased pricing, cost cutting and technology improvements helped compensate for flat domestic shipping volume.

The delivery giant is no longer competing for deliveries inside United States borders, but it still jostles for public awareness with its rivals UPS, FedEx and, to an extent, the Postal Service — each of which also in recent weeks began advertising campaigns highlighting their acumen in mail and express delivery. DHL has been less visible in the United States after eliminating thousands of jobs at its Ohio air hub and other locations in 2008 to offset a drop in deliveries of mortgage documents, contracts and other time-sensitive material. But now it is renewing its American presence with its “international specialist” campaign to emphasize its ability to handle customs clearance and other aspects of overseas shipping, said Christine Nashick, vice president for marketing for DHL Express U.S. An American presence is important to DHL because 40 percent of its largest 350 global business clients are based in the United States. The new campaign, she said, aims to expand that customer base with small- and medium-size companies that have 500 or fewer employees and are shipping abroad.  The ads begin with a DHL van dissolving into a streak of yellow light that speeds around the globe then lights up the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks. The ad is set to a remixed soundtrack of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” the Motown classic that DHL also used in a commercial two decades ago. “This is a contemporary spin on that earlier effort,” said Joseph Siegel , director of advertising, brand and communication at DHL Express U.S. “The company started as an international shipper in the U.S., so you could say we’re going back to our roots.” The campaign, created with 180 Amsterdam, which is owned by the Omnicom Group, includes print ads in major business magazines like “Entrepreneur,” and Web ads on Yahoo.com and other news sites. Also, 30-second spots will be shown on the CNN network in 45 airports around the country, as well as on television channels including the BBC. The print and digital ads touch on fashion, auto, high tech and health care, including one showing a model in a glowing dress that says: “A dress is stitched in Paris. The next night it’s applauded in New York.” Another ad says: “A contract is signed in London. By 10:30 a.m. the next day it touches down on Wall Street.” Each ends with: “That’s the speed of yellow. DHL Express. Excellence. Simply Delivered.” The campaign is appearing in 19 American markets and 42 global markets. DHL did not disclose its advertising budget, but Ms. Nashick said that about 50 percent of its spending was in digital and about 20 percent in print. “Digital is more fun, and we can interact with our customers,” she said. “We are also showing in airports and other travel locations because that’s a more effective spend.” Last year, DHL spent about $8 million on advertising in the United States market, according to Kantar Media, a WPP unit. The DHL spending will increase this year, Ms. Nashick said, but over all, it is a blip compared with ad spending by its rivals. Last year, FedEx spent about $121 million and UPS approximately $109 million, according to Kantar. UPS, for example, is reprising its “We (heart) logistics” campaign, which it began last year, to promote its role as the official logistics provider for the London 2012 Olympic Games. The campaign, created with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a WPP holding, describes the UPS role in delivering one million pieces of sports equipment, among other items, to England next summer. The campaign is largely digital, mobile and social, said Betsy Wilson, the company’s director of global advertising. FedEx introduced its new campaign last month, with the theme, “Solutions that matter,” to describe the range of FedEx answers for customers’ shipping needs. The campaign, with BBDO New York, part of the BBDO North America unit of BBDO Worldwide (owned by the Omnicom Group), includes digital, social media and movie theater commercials in addition to television spots. The campaign covers health care, auto parts shipping and the company’s environmental awareness, including more electric trucks and more efficient air planes.  While the air express giants vie to gain market share, the beleaguered Postal Service is rolling out a new television ad campaign highlighting the value of first-class mail. The post office, which spent $145 million last year on advertising, also delivers packages via its express and priority services, but its share of the air delivery market is only about 3 percent, according to the Air Cargo Management Group, an aviation consulting firm based in Seattle. In addition to the United States market, DHL is directing a significant part of its international specialists campaign to the $80 million global delivery business by having the campaign translated into 25 languages, and appearing on 280 television stations and in 360 print publications around the world. In contrast to the American market, “international lanes are growing in the high single digits,” said Peter Nesvold, who analyzes the express delivery industry for Jefferies &amp; Company, “and that’s where the money is being made.”AFTER a major retrenchment in the United States three years ago, DHL Express U.S. is repositioning itself with a new marketing campaign to persuade medium-size and smaller American companies to sign up for its international shipping expertise.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/business/18ups.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Britain Limits Some U.P.S. Cargo Operations<date>Published: June 17, 2011</date><text>LONDON (AP) — United Parcel Service, the shipping company, has been ordered to stop moving air cargo through some of its British facilities because of security flaws, the British government said Friday.The order is the result of a planned security check rather than a new threat to aviation — and a sign of heightened concerns about the vulnerability of cargo in the wake of an Al Qaeda plot to disguise bombs as toner cartridges shipped on freight flights from Yemen. The Department for Transport in Britain said that “following careful consideration, the department has restricted the number of sites in the U.K. at which U.P.S. Ltd. are permitted to screen air cargo until it has satisfied current security requirements.” It gave no details of the security issues and did not identify the locations involved. No other air freight companies were mentioned in the statement. U.P.S., which is based in Atlanta, said the restrictions were the result of a security review rather than any specific threat. A U.P.S. spokeswoman, Susan Rosenberg, said six of the company’s British package-screening facilities were still operating, its main air hub at East Midlands Airport in central England was open and its planes were still flying to and from Britain. She would not say how many facilities had been shut, how many packages were being disrupted or whether packages being sent to Britain as well as those leaving the country were affected, citing the need to preserve secrecy around security arrangements. The United States has not taken similar measures, because U.P.S. Ltd. U.K. is a separate subsidiary of U.P.S. and is not regulated by the United States government, an American Transportation Security Administration official said. The official said the United States already had “stringent security protocols” in place for air cargo security. U.P.S. told customers Friday that some shipments from Britain were being delayed. It said “areas of concern” were found during a government review of “U.P.S. procedures and employment documentation related to security.” The company said some facilities had been temporarily “taken offline,” leading to delays in package movements. “U.P.S. has activated contingency plans, communicated with customers and expects service levels to return to normal early next week,” the company said. “U.P.S. continues to work with all agencies around the world to maintain and enhance security and to balance necessary protections with the free flow of commerce, just as we have always done.”LONDON (AP) — United Parcel Service, the shipping company, has been ordered to stop moving air cargo through some of its British facilities because of security flaws, the British government said Friday.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/us/06cncups.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S. Workers Demand New Approach to Safety<date>Published: May 5, 2011</date><text>Joe Korziuk has spent 23 years working for U.P.S. washing trucks, delivering packages and driving tractor trailers. Though he loves the job, it has a downside: At 45, he has had surgery on both knees and a shoulder, developed bulging disks in his back and sustained a concussion when boxes fell on him.“It’s a direct result of the job,” Mr. Korziuk said. “They’re always harping on you and pushing you to go faster and faster.” Mr. Korziuk was among about 1,200 members of Teamsters Local 705 representing several hubs in the Chicago area who began a campaign last week demanding that U.P.S. reduce workloads and change what the union calls a “blame the worker” approach to health and safety. On April 28, Teamsters nationwide wore stickers reading “Unfair Production Standards,” a play on the name U.P.S. Employees said they were pressured to increase productivity while at the same time they were pushed to reduce injuries, a combination that workers claim leads many of them to avoid reporting injuries. Workers and union officials said the health and safety issues at U.P.S. affected tens of thousands of employees. They also said the issues symbolized larger trends in many workplaces where people were pressured to work longer and harder, resulting in more physical effects, even as long-term job security and health care access had become more precarious. U.P.S. officials say safety is a top priority and note that their latest statistics on reported injuries are lower than national averages for the courier and messenger industry: 1.6 injuries per 200,000 work hours for employees at the Addison hub and 3.6 for U.P.S. workers nationwide. The industry average is 4.7 injuries per 200,000 hours. U.P.S. workers are required to memorize and frequently recite a list of more than 20 safety standards, and they can be fired if they fail the recitation multiple times, according to workers and to a disciplinary report reviewed by the Chicago News Cooperative. Supervisors regularly observe workers and document safety lapses. After employees report injuries, they are required to meet with company health and safety specialists and get extra training. Workers said that the company called people who had been injured multiple times “repeaters” and that those people were more frequently monitored by supervisors. Some employees said they felt as though the safety programs were based on the premise that workers would not get hurt if they followed proper procedures. They said workers frequently did not report injuries to avoid angering supervisors or to avoid extra training and scrutiny. U.P.S. officials said additional monitoring and other procedures were important to make sure workers understood safety protocol. “If you have a strain, sprain or rupture to your knee, back or shoulder, no matter how minor it is, we’re going to do a few things with that person,” said Steve Vaughn, manager for the corporate Comprehensive Health and Safety Process at the Addison facility. ”We have online assessments to re-educate them on safe work methods. If I strain my shoulder, there will be occupational health education on how your shoulder works, on how to eliminate the risk from being injured again.” The company’s delivery drivers usually pick up or deliver about 500 packages a day and make up to 20 stops an hour, workers said. They are supposed to handle packages, often several at a time, of up to 70 pounds without assistance. Workers who drive tractor trailers from one U.P.S. facility to another are expected to take 36.57 minutes to perform a list of more than 100 tasks, including inspecting and testing brakes and lights and checking connections between the tractors and their trailers. “It’s not only doable, but it’s doable with ease,” Mr. Vaughn said. Many tractor trailer drivers disagree. They said they found it nearly impossible to complete the checklist in the allotted time, and they added that their bosses often looked the other way as the safety checklists were ignored. “Sometimes the supervisor just slaps your door closed and says go; you don’t even get to eyeball your load” to make sure the weight is distributed safely, said Bernie Jayne, a 57-year-old driver. “So you’re driving down the road with a mud flap dangling or a lug nut loose. They turn a blind eye until something happens.” 1 2 Next Page » klydersen@chicagonewscoop.orgJoe Korziuk has spent 23 years working for U.P.S. washing trucks, delivering packages and driving tractor trailers.

Two days after Mr. Obama set a national goal of cutting oil imports by one-third by 2025, in a speech at Georgetown University, he was scheduled to travel on Friday to a shipping center in Landover, Md., just outside Washington, to view new “clean fleets” belonging to the two delivery giants and to AT&amp;T, PepsiCo and Verizon. The president’s focus on clean energy this week comes at a time when Americans are paying gasoline prices that now average about $4 a gallon, close to the high levels just before he won election in 2008. According to the White House, the five corporations have commercial fleets that are among the 10 largest in the country; together they own more than 275,000 cars and trucks. They have joined the administration’s new public-private partnership to encourage a switch to vehicles that are more fuel-efficient or run on electric power or alternative fuels. In the near term, the five companies will deploy more than 20,000 advanced-technology vehicles, saving more than 7 million gallons of oil, the administration estimated. The National Clean Fleets Partnership would be open to companies of all sizes, according to the White House. Through the Department of Energy, which already has a Clean Cities vehicle technology program, participants would get up-to-date technical information and purchasing assistance. For example, smaller companies could piggy-back on larger corporations’ bulk purchases, enjoying the same cost savings on advanced vehicles that use electric batteries, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen or propane.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/u-p-s-finds-a-substitute-for-diesel-natural-gas-at-260-degrees-below-zero/?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S. Finds a Substitute for Diesel: Natural Gas, at 260 Degrees Below Zero<date>February 22, 2011, 8:00 am</date><text>United Parcel Service U.P.S. is about to add 48 trucks powered by liquefied natural gas and would like to deploy more. The final frontier for alternative motor fuels, powering big tractor-trailers, has been crossed. The alternative is natural gas, but not in the now-familiar form of compressed gas. Instead, a growing number of the biggest trucks are running on liquefied natural gas. Burdened by diesel prices that topped out at over $5 a gallon in 2008 and mindful of the sustained collapse of natural gas prices, trucking companies are expressing new interest in liquefied natural gas for their thirstiest trucks, the over-the-road 18-wheelers. “It’s the only long-term viable option to diesel,’’ said Michael G. Britt Sr., director of maintenance and engineering at United Parcel Service, which is about to add 48 L.N.G. trucks and would like to deploy many more, if the fueling infrastructure is in place and if truck production volume rises enough to bring down costs. Many other companies are running test fleets. Compressed natural gas is not a practical substitute for diesel with these tractor-trailers, because they burn so much fuel on a trip, consuming 20,000 to 30,000 gallons a year. From an energy and environmental standpoint, they are a prime target because collectively they account for three-quarters of the fuel used by commercial vehicles. By one estimate, switching to liquefied natural gas could reduce oil imports by more than a million barrels a day. According to Rich Kolodziej, the president of NGV America, a trade association, the amount of diesel fuel currently used annually for highway travel would work out to six trillion cubic feet of natural gas. (Current national natural gas demand over all is in the range of 22 trillion cubic feet a year.) Prices are depressed because of the recession and because the government has sharply raised its estimate of gas reserves as a result of the expansion of a drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Natural gas prices per million B.T.U., the standard unit for gas, rose to over $12 before the recession began, but are now in the range of $4 to $4.50. Scientists and engineers are working on another alternative for these trucks, diesel fuel made from some renewable source, but have not found a formula for commercial success. So the best alternative appears to be liquefied natural gas. L.N.G. requires only about 70 percent more space than diesel fuel. Compressed gas, in contrast, needs about six times as much space as diesel, even when squeezed down to 3,000 pounds per square inch. U.P.S. plans to begin adding 48 liquefied natural gas trucks to its hubs in Ontario, Calif., and Las Vegas in the next few days. These will be 15-liter, 450-horsepower diesel engines, the biggest in common use on the highways. Like engines running on diesel fuel, they work without spark plugs, igniting the fuel through compression. Compression-ignited engines are more efficient than spark-ignited engines, so they get more work out of a given amount of fuel. Upon start-up, they will use a few squirts of diesel to get going; a computer will also add diesel fuel when it senses that the engine needs it for lubrication. But over all, diesel use will be cut by about 95 percent. U.P.S. runs a virtual menagerie of alternative vehicles using propane, batteries or hydrogen fuel cells. Some are hybrids that use hydraulic pressure instead of electric batteries. But natural gas chilled to 260 degrees below zero and squeezed down 600 times in volume is the company’s choice, Mr. Britt said. His 450-horsepower tractors need so much energy to tow two trailers over mountainous terrain that “the first trailer would have to be all batteries,’’ he said. U.P.S. received $5.5 million for the project from the state of California that was allocated by the federal Energy Department. The company used $4 million to pay for the extra cost of the trucks and funneled $1.5 million to Clean Energy of Seal Beach, Calif., to build a fueling station. U.P.S. is not alone. Kenworth, the truck manufacturer, reports several orders in the last few weeks for L.N.G. trucks. Eighteen went to Enviro Express, a company in Bridgeport, Conn., that uses them to haul trash and recyclables. And the truck maker Peterbilt said in January that a trucking company in British Columbia had ordered 50 L.N.G. trucks. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., run about 1,000 trucks on liquefied natural gas, but outside of that, only about 300 others are running around the country, according to Clean Energy, a company that supplies compressed and liquefied gas. But Westport Innovations of Vancouver, British Columbia, which makes engines that are certified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to run on liquefied natural gas, said it had orders for 230 engines in the next 12 months. It has not announced total orders for its past fiscal year, but in the first three quarters it sold fewer than 30. Chilling the gas into a liquid costs energy, but Clean Energy says that a lot of gas is already being liquefied anyway. Natural gas refineries chill the gas that drillers take out of the ground to separate naturally occurring molecules like pentane, ethane and propane and to make a product that meets the specifications needed for gas pipelines, said James N. Harger, the company’s chief marketing officer. Clean Energy, which was founded by T. Boone Pickens, is selling an amount of natural gas that is equivalent to a gallon of diesel for $1.25 less, a major consideration in vehicles that use hundreds of gallons a week. But then there’s the $1.5 million cost of building an L.N.G. fueling station with several bays for trucks, Mr. Harger noted. A spokesman for Westport, the engine company, said the fueling problem was “your classic chicken and egg.’’ “The incumbent petroleum-based fuels have this continental network of fueling stations, and natural gas has that as well, but it’s going through a pipeline to feed people’s homes and the power industry,” he said. The challenge is to furnish it in a form that vehicles can use in the same sort of ubiquitous way that trucks use diesel, he explained. “The key is to get the number of trucks up,’’ he said. U.P.S. has about 17,000 big tractor-trailers and would like to switch 1,000 of them to liquefied natural gas, but cannot do so now because the fuel is available in only a handful of places. Production volumes of the trucks are so low that their cost remains high, about $200,000, compared with only about $100,000 for a standard diesel truck, according to Kara Gerhardt Ross, a U.P.S. spokeswoman. But the company’s demonstration fleet, 11 vehicles shuttling between Ontario, Calif., and Las Vegas, has shown that the trucks can handle the most demanding situations, like hauling multiple trailers over mountain ranges, U.P.S. says.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/u-p-s-finds-a-substitute-for-diesel-natural-gas/?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S.

Profit Climbs 48% as Shipments Rise<date>Published: February 1, 2011</date><text>United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 48 percent as shipments increased across the globe during the holiday season.The company said business was particularly strong in China and Germany, two countries that rely heavily on exports. It expects 2011 earnings to rise 16 to 22 percent and to top prerecession levels of 2007. For 2011, U.P.S. expects earnings of $4.12 to $4.35, compared with the current analyst forecast of $4.19. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the company said it earned $1.12 billion, or $1.11 a share, compared with $757 million, or 75 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $13.42 billion from $12.38 billion. Revenue in the company’s international package unit rose 9.2 percent, while revenue in the United States, its largest segment, improved by 7 percent. Exports from China, which include a range of goods from toys to electronics, rose more than 30 percent. Exports from Germany increased by more than 10 percent, U.P.S. said. In the United States, the company earned more money per package as consumers and businesses paid extra to get goods to their destinations faster. U.P.S. also raised base prices and fuel surcharges. Despite higher package volume in all of its segments, U.P.S. operated fewer trucks and planes in the three-month period to improve its productivity. Revenue for U.P.S.’s warehousing and freight division rose 12.8 percent. The results topped expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet Research forecast a profit of $1.05 a share on revenue of $13.32 billion.

The Scotland Yard statement, confined to three terse paragraphs, offered the clearest sense so far of the danger averted when two bombs were intercepted en route from Yemen to Chicago, one in Britain and one in Dubai. Offering a timeline, the statement said that if the device found in Britain had not been removed from a cargo plane that was allowed to fly on to Philadelphia, “activation could have occurred over the eastern seaboard of the U.S.” It set the moment of detonation at 5:30 a.m. Eastern time. Because shipping times cannot be predicted accurately, it remains unclear whether the plotters themselves would have known where the bomb would have detonated or what it would have destroyed. But cargo industry sources say it could be possible to narrow down a time window to as little as a few hours, using prior deliveries as a guide. American officials have said that the group they suspect is behind the bombs, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, might have made shipments in September that functioned as dry runs. The plot appeared to represent a new chapter in efforts to attack the United States by exploiting vulnerabilities in the international air cargo system. After Saudi Arabia tipped off Western intelligence to the possibility of bombs on cargo aircraft two weeks ago Friday, the British authorities identified one on a U.P.S. 747 at an air-cargo hub in East Midlands, about 100 miles north of London. The Scotland Yard statement said the 747 landed at 2:13 a.m. British time. The package was not immediately identified as a bomb. The explosive material used — PETN — is an odorless, colorless plastic that is difficult to detect. British officials said sniffer dogs and explosives-detection equipment missed it, prompting the authorities to allow the U.P.S. plane to proceed to Philadelphia, leaving the package behind for further examination. The statement said the plane left at 4:20 a.m. British time. But the statement said that the “suspect package” was not deactivated, by separating the cartridge from the printer, for another three hours, at 7:40 a.m. British time. As the investigation has unfolded, British officials have emphasized the difficulty of “reverse engineering” the bomb, to determine how the detonating mechanism was intended to work, and when it was designed to explode. American officials have said that both bombs contained circuit boards from cellphones, but the phone parts appeared to be used as timers, because the so-called SIM cards necessary to receive calls were missing. As the American authorities searched the U.P.S. 747 in Philadelphia and hunted for any other possible bombs in the cargo system, British officials continued to say they had found no explosives in the offloaded carton. Eventually, the printer and the cartridge were flown in a police helicopter to a government laboratory outside London. The first public confirmation that the printer contained explosives came from the home secretary, Theresa May, who is responsible for British domestic counterterrorist operations, more than 21 hours after the U.P.S. plane had landed in Britain. It was past noon on the next day when Ms. May announced that the printer was a “viable bomb.” Later the same day, David Cameron, the British prime minister, said investigators had concluded that the U.P.S. plane could have been blown apart over Britain. That conclusion appeared to have been overtaken by the Scotland Yard statement on Wednesday. Several other airliner bombing plots since the 9/11 attacks have been foiled at late stages in the planning process, or disrupted aboard the aircraft intended as a target, as happened when a Nigerian militant trained by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula tried to bomb an American trans-Atlantic airliner approaching Detroit last Dec. 25. A plot to bomb seven trans-Atlantic airliners over the Atlantic in 2006 was uncovered as a result of intercepted telephone calls and e-mails between Qaeda plotters in Pakistan and Britain, and several plotters were sentenced to life imprisonment after trials in Britain. The latest plot differed in having made targets of the international air cargo network, with security systems that differ widely around the world, and which, especially outside the United States, tend to be far less rigorous than the checks routine for passenger flights.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/world/middleeast/10iht-letter.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">In Yemen, Cultural Propriety Poses a Security Challenge<date>Published: November 9, 2010</date><text>SANA, YEMEN — Hanan al-Samawi was in bed when she heard a knock at the door of her house followed by a woman’s voice asking to see her. The woman identified herself as “Hanan’s friend.” Ms. Samawi walked out to meet the unannounced visitor. She saw a number of Yemeni women standing at the door, dressed in the ubiquitous long black dress and full facial veil. As she extended her arm to courteously welcome the first woman, she was dragged from the front steps all the way through the outer gate of the house and shoved into a vehicle that shot off instantly. “I thought I was being kidnapped,” Ms. Samawi recalled, with fear in her eyes. This was taking place as the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, publicly declared that the police were surrounding the house of a woman suspected of shipping two packages containing explosives from Yemen, which had been discovered a day earlier in Britain and Dubai en route to the United States. “Once the suspected woman is apprehended, she will be interrogated by the security services, and we will use the information she provides,” Mr. Saleh asserted in a news conference held in the Yemeni capital on Oct. 30. As it turned out, Ms. Samawi had no information to offer and was released two days later, when the security services realized that she was not the terrorist they were seeking. Ms. Samawi, 23, is a computer engineering student at Sana University. She leads a simple traditional life, which for a Yemeni woman of her age means staying at home when she does not need to be out. She leaves her house to go to school and returns immediately after her classes end. Her father, a 60-year-old engineer, often drops her off and picks her up himself. Any other activities that involve leaving the confines of her house, whether to visit relatives or go shopping, are done in the company of her mother or father. She mingles with her girlfriends at the university but never visits them in their homes. And, like the very vast majority of women in Yemen, Ms. Samawi covers her face when she goes out in public. This conservative lifestyle is not peculiar in the Yemeni context. It reflects deeply rooted social values that attach a great deal of sanctity to the measured movement and privacy of women. College girls walking in and out of a university campus, for example, are almost never asked to show an identification card. And if they need to present their ID at any point, they will typically hold it so that their thumb covers the picture and then allow the guard or employee to quickly gaze over the rest of the details. Under normal circumstances, there is no way to know if the name on the card belongs to the face behind the veil. And while there is no overt law banning this, it is considered socially reprehensible for any man to demand that a woman reveal her face. “No one will dare ask you to show your face in order to make sure it’s really you,” said Amal al-Sereihy, a friend of Ms. Samawi’s and a recent graduate of Sana University. She covers the picture on her school ID by taping a piece of paper over it. This way, she explains, she does not have to worry every time she takes the card in and out of her wallet. Ms. Seheiry also said that when she travels with her father or brothers in the car and they arrive at a checkpoint, once the police realize that she, a woman, is in the company of her male relatives, they will not even look into the car, let alone stop or search them. This form of cultural propriety presents an obvious security challenge. It is what allowed an anonymous woman to walk into the U.P.S. office in Sana, about two weeks ago, and send a packaged bomb using the identity of Hanan al-Samawi without even having to show her face to a single person. “Not everyone has an ID in Yemen, and the man behind the desk will certainly not ask a woman to show her face in order to verify her identity,” said one senior Yemeni official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. This is a social law that is unanimously understood and accepted. And this is what prompted the government here to bring female police officers into the Yemeni counterterrorism units. The women who showed up at Ms. Samawi’s house were policewomen who had been trained to participate in raids so that women could be seen, searched or arrested only by other women. “Training women to serve as officers is a necessity because terrorist organizations increasingly utilize women to evade investigations or searches, knowing that male police are less likely to suspect a female operative,” Faisal Darem wrote in an article in the October issue of Yemen Today. Within this cultural framework, Ms. Samawi was the unfortunate victim of circumstance. She refused to answer questions about the details surrounding the period of her arrest and interrogation for fear of retribution. Her world had been turned upside down, and her name publicly linked to an international terrorist plot. “I keep asking myself, ‘Why me?’ There was zero percent chance that something like this could happen,” Ms. Samawi said, adding that the entire situation was so far beyond her comprehension that she did not actually understand what it is she was being accused of until she was released. She then joked that she might have been picked on because she is only about 1.5 meters, or 5 feet, tall. But behind her shy laugh was a look of anguish and lingering shock. At her house, the day after her release, Ms. Samawi sat in a small room with her father to receive family members who came by to welcome her back. The television set was tuned to the news, and when a three-minute feature about the thwarted terror plot came up, including segments about the arrest and release of Ms. Samawi, she watched intently. It appeared like she was still trying to grasp what had happened. “I am just glad it is over,” she said quietly.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/world/asia/05yemen.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.S. Plays Down Ticking Bomb Talk<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>PARIS (AP) — American and British officials played down on Thursday a comment by the French interior minister, who said that one of the two cargo bombs sent from Yemen last week had been disarmed just 17 minutes before it was set to go off. The issue of timing is central to the investigation because it could indicate whether terrorists hoped to blow up the planes over American airspace or whether they simply wanted to take down the planes regardless of their location. “One of the packages was defused only 17 minutes before the moment that it was set to explode,” Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told the state-run France-2 television station. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said that the question of when the bombs found in Britain and the United Arab Emirates were to go off was still under investigation and that there was no information confirming such a close call. The State Department’s counterterrorism coordinator, Daniel Benjamin, also questioned the French minister’s comments. “This is not our understanding of the situation,” he told reporters.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/world/02terror.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Early Parcels Sent to U.S. Were Eyed as Dry Run<date>Published: November 1, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — American intelligence officials in September intercepted several packages containing books, papers, CDs and other household items shipped to Chicago from Yemen and considered the possibility that the parcels might be a test run for a terrorist attack, two officials said Monday night.Now the intelligence officials believe that the shipments, whose hour-by-hour locations could be tracked by the sender on the shippers’ Web sites, may have been used to plan the route and timing for two printer cartridges packed with explosives that were sent from Yemen and intercepted in Britain and Dubai on Friday. In September, after American counterterrorism agencies received information linking the packages to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror network’s branch in Yemen, intelligence officers stopped the shipments in transit and searched them, said the officials, who would discuss the operation only on the condition of anonymity. They found no explosives, and the packages were permitted to continue to what appeared to be “random addresses” with no connection to the terrorist group in Chicago. “At the time, people obviously took notice and — knowing of the terrorist group’s interest in aviation — considered the possibility that AQAP might be exploring the logistics of the cargo system,” one of the officials said, referring to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The apparent test run might have permitted the plotters to estimate when cargo planes carrying the doctored toner cartridges would be over Chicago or another city. That would conceivably enable them to set timers on the two devices to set off explosions where they would cause the greatest damage. The September shipments were first reported by ABC News on Monday night, which also noted that Inspire, the English-language magazine of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, recently published a picture of the Chicago skyline. One of the officials said that when the American intelligence agents received a tip from Saudi intelligence officials last week that bombs might be on cargo flights to Chicago from Yemen, analysts “recalled the incident and factored it in to our government’s very prompt response.” “Both events reflect solid intelligence work,” the official said. On Monday, Germany, France and Britain said they had banned cargo shipments from Yemen, following a similar move by the United States. Britain prohibited passengers from carrying printer cartridges aboard flights, and Germany halted passenger flights from Yemen as well. Many countries have stepped up cargo screening, but no additional bombs have been found. After the recovery of the unexploded printer cartridges in Dubai and Britain on Friday, Yemeni and American intelligence officials have stepped up the hunt for Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, 28, a Saudi who is believed to be the top technical expert of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. They believe he designed the underwear explosives that failed to detonate aboard a Detroit-bound airliner last Dec. 25, as well as the body-cavity bomb that killed his younger brother, Abdullah al-Asiri, in a failed attempt last year to assassinate the top Saudi counterterrorism official, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. In a related development, a Yemeni official in Washington said late Monday night that prosecutors in Yemen intend to charge the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki later this week with “the crime of promoting violence and the killing of foreigners.” The official, who asked not to be named, said the case would likely be sent to a specialized criminal court in Sana, the capital. No evidence has been made public linking Mr. Awlaki to the printer cartridge bombs, but intelligence officials believe he played a role in the failed airliner bombing last December, and he has publicly called for more attacks on the United States. Early this year, he became the first American citizen to be placed on the Central Intelligence Agency’s list of terrorists approved for targeted killing. On Monday, information about the latest failed plot continued to emerge. An American official said that the addresses on the packages were outdated addresses for Jewish institutions in Chicago. But in place of the names of the institutions, the packages bore the names of historical figures from the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition, the official said. The addresses are one reason that investigators now believe the plan may have been to blow up the planes, since there were no longer synagogues at the Chicago locations. Explosives experts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been sent to London and Dubai to inspect the printer bombs, and technicians planned to “reverse-engineer” the bombs to understand their construction and purpose, Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, told National Public Radio. The Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said Sunday that he would keep up pressure on Al Qaeda, which he said had killed 70 members of the Yemeni Army and security forces during the past four weeks.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/opinion/02heifetz.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">How to Keep Terrorism Grounded<date>Published: November 1, 2010</date><text>Washington LAST week our country averted a disaster. Good work by American and foreign intelligence officials pinpointed explosives hidden in packages shipped in Yemen and bound on airplanes for the United States. But we cannot rely on getting such timely, accurate intelligence — it often is simply unavailable — and the episode highlighted a number of problems with our system for screening inbound air cargo. The Department of Homeland Security has established very good “risk rating” systems to prevent dangerous goods from entering the country. The problem is that these systems are used only for cargo on ships, not for that arriving by air. For oceangoing cargo, importers and shippers are required to provide substantial data on every container: the country of origin, the location where the container was packed, the seller, the buyer, where on the ship the container is stored and so forth. The Department of Homeland Security, through its Customs and Border Protection agency, uses this data to generate a risk rating, and any package with a high rating gets substantial additional scrutiny. Sometimes this includes a physical search by foreign security personnel under the guidance of American officials, and in all cases it occurs before the ship even leaves the foreign port. Any package from trouble-ridden Yemen would be seen as a risk and likely would be a target for additional scrutiny. So why is there no similar system in place for air cargo? There are two parts to the answer: one has to do with Congress and the other with the Department of Homeland Security. In 2007, Congress passed a law requiring, within three years, physical screening — X-rays, dogs and the like — for all cargo on passenger planes. But the law did nothing to increase security on all-cargo flights like those operated by U.P.S. And while it didn’t explicitly ban the use of risk rating, Congress clearly didn’t want any shortcuts — it wanted every package checked physically. In effect, lawmakers made the perfect the enemy of the good. Homeland Security officials had a tough challenge in meeting the Congressional mandate, but in large part they succeeded: by August of this year, 100 percent of cargo on passenger flights within and from the United States was being physically screened. However, only about 65 percent of cargo on passenger planes arriving in the United States from abroad is now subjected to some physical screening, and the percentage is far lower on all-cargo flights. Some officials insist that we will have 100-percent physical screening for inbound air cargo within a few years. But that is wildly optimistic — we lack authority to force foreign countries to conduct the physical screening mandated by Congress, and many of these countries lack the resources to do it. And even if we could compel adherence to our screening requirements, that would still not address cargo-only flights, which were untouched by the 2007 law. Given that nearly three-quarters of air cargo is moved by all-cargo flights, a physical screening system for them may not be feasible even inside the United States. The only practical way to increase the security of inbound air cargo is to rely on a risk rating system rather than a physical screening system. It simply makes sense to decide which packages and flights are most likely to be dangerous, and focus on them. Besides, the information collection and analysis would not even require building new infrastructure or imposing our rules on foreign soil. Homeland security officials already collect electronically most of the data needed for risk analysis of air cargo. Critically, however, the officials who get this data are from Customs and Border Protection, while the people Congress assigned to handle air cargo screening are from the Transportation Security Administration. The T.S.A. has understandably focused on the physical screening requirements in the 2007 law, because that’s what our lawmakers wanted and that’s what its employees are trained to do with air passengers and luggage. Let’s hope that last week’s close call will convince T.S.A. officials and Congress that universal physical screening is a long way off, and that in the meantime we need a risk-assessment system for air cargo modeled on the one Customs uses for ship-borne containers. It would take courage for the Homeland Security Department to tell Congress, “We’ve got to do things a bit differently than you may have had in mind — we’re going to use this well-tested risk-rating model.” But it would significantly enhance national security.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/world/01terror.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Bomb Plot Shows Key Role Played by Intelligence<date>Published: October 31, 2010</date><text>In the middle of last week, a woman who claimed her name was Hanan al-Samawi, a 22-year-old engineering student, walked into the U.P.S. office in the upscale Hadda neighborhood of Sana, Yemen’s sprawling capital city. She displayed a photocopied identification card, and dropped off a bomb hidden inside a printer cartridge with a Chicago address listed as the package’s destination. A few blocks away, another package concealing a homemade bomb was dropped off at a FedEx office, also seemingly headed to Chicago.Within days, the two packages had advanced through four countries in at least four different airplanes — two of them carrying passengers — before they were identified in Britain and Dubai after an 11th-hour tip from Saudi Arabia’s intelligence service set off an international terrorism alert and a frantic hunt. The foiling of the package plot was a significant success in an era of well-publicized intelligence breakdowns and miscommunications. It was also a sobering reminder to officials around the world that quick response to timely intelligence rules the day. Despite the billions of dollars governments have spent on elaborate airport technology to guard against terrorism threats, the packages would probably have been loaded onto planes bound for the United States, but for the Saudi tip. But the plot also points up holes in the system, particularly the security of cargo flights, that have already caused criticism abroad and are likely to rekindle new debates in the United States. In Qatar, officials acknowledged Sunday that one of the packages had been carried on two Qatar Airways passenger planes, apparently having eluded the airline’s cargo screening system. In Britain, officials were embarrassed about how long it took the authorities to identify one of the packages as a carefully concealed bomb. American and Yemeni officials still have little hard evidence about who was involved in the thwarted attack. On Sunday officials in Yemen discovered that Ms. Samawi’s identity had apparently been stolen, and that she was not the same woman who dropped off the packages. Ms. Samawi was released on bail on Sunday, and the authorities in Yemen have thus far arrested no other suspects. It was one more piece of a carefully designed and cleverly disguised plot that investigators believe was conceived by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen, the group that American officials say might pose the most immediate threat to American soil. In television appearances on Sunday, John O. Brennan, President Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, said that American and British authorities were leaning toward the conclusion that the packages were meant to detonate in midair, en route to their destinations in Chicago. If that turns out to be the case, it would be a rare attack aimed at the air cargo system — one of the foundations of the global economy — rather than the passenger system, which has received the most attention from governments working to avoid a repeat of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. For the most part, governments around the world had bet that it was less likely that the cargo system would be the target of attacks, given that its flights carry few passengers. “It is time for the shipping industry and the business community to accept the reality that more needs to be done to secure cargo planes so that they cannot be turned into a delivery systems for bombs targeting our country,” Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement. Congress in 2007, in legislation proposed by Mr. Markey, mandated that all air cargo be inspected before it is loaded onto passenger planes, setting an August 2010 deadline for the requirement. But as of the deadline, only about 65 percent of the cargo headed to the United States on passenger planes from abroad is inspected — and a far smaller proportion coming to the United States on all-cargo flights is physically checked, as these planes are not subject to the mandate. Even when the cargo is checked, air carriers in certain countries use equipment like X-ray detection devices or a visual check by an airport worker that often cannot identify packages with bombs, because the small amount of explosive material can be carefully hidden inside a routine electronic device, like a computer printer. Interviews in Washington, London and the Middle East reveal how the two bombs made their way through several countries before the tip from Saudi intelligence officials caused them to be pulled from airplanes. The bomb dropped at the U.P.S. office in Sana ended up in East Midlands Airport, near Nottingham, England, by way of Cologne, Germany. A terrorism alert from Washington provoked a search for the package, which was found and kept from being shipped to the United States. But British authorities took more than 20 hours to determine that it contained hidden explosives. Theresa May, the British home secretary, told the BBC that the government would review its security arrangements for handling air cargo entering or passing through Britain in the wake of the printer-bomb plot, but declined to give any details.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/world/31terror.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.S. Sees Complexity of Bombs as Link to Al Qaeda<date>Published: October 30, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The powerful bombs concealed inside cargo packages and destined for the United States were expertly constructed and unusually sophisticated, American officials said Saturday, further evidence that Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen is steadily improving its abilities to strike on American soil.As investigators on three continents conducted forensic analyses of two bombs shipped from Yemen and intercepted Friday in Britain and Dubai, American officials said evidence was mounting that the top leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including the radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was behind the attempted attacks. Yemeni officials on Saturday announced the arrest of a young woman and her mother in connection with the plot, which also may have involved two language schools in Yemen. The two women were not identified, but a defense lawyer who has been in contact with the family, Abdul Rahman Barham, said the daughter was a 22 year-old engineering student at Sana University. Yemen’s president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said Saturday night during a news conference that Yemeni security forces had identified her based on a tip from American officials, but he did not indicate her suspected role. Investigators said that the bomb discovered at the Dubai airport in the United Arab Emirates was concealed in a Hewlett-Packard desktop printer, with high explosives packed into a printer cartridge to avoid detection by scanners. “The wiring of the device indicates that this was done by professionals,” said one official involved in the investigation, who like several officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing. “It was set up so that if you scan it, all the printer components would look right.” The bomb discovered in Britain was also hidden in a printer cartridge. The terror plot broke publicly in dramatic fashion on Friday morning, when the two packages containing explosives and addressed to synagogues or Jewish community centers in Chicago were found, setting off an international dragnet and fears about packages yet to be discovered. It also led to a tense scene in which American military jets escorted a plane to Kennedy International Airport amid concerns — which turned out to be unfounded — that there might be explosives on board. On Saturday, in news conferences in London and Yemen, and from interviews with investigators here and abroad, the contours of the investigation began to emerge, along with new details of the frantic hours leading to the discovery of the packages. American officials said their operating assumption was that the two bombs were the work of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, Al Qaeda in Yemen’s top bomb-maker, whose previous devices have been more rudimentary, and also unsuccessful. Mr. Asiri is believed to have built both the bomb sewn into the underwear of the young Nigerian who tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight last Dec. 25, and the suicide bomb that nearly killed Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief, Mohammed bin Nayef, months earlier. (In the second episode, American officials say, Mr. Asiri hid the explosives in a body cavity of his brother, the suicide bomber.) Just as in the two previous attacks, the bomb discovered in Dubai contained the explosive PETN, according to the Dubai police and Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security. This new plot, Ms. Napolitano said, had the “hallmarks of Al Qaeda.” The targets of the bombs remained in question. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said on Saturday that the parcel bomb intercepted in England was designed to explode while the plane was flying. The country’s home secretary, Theresa May, said that British investigators had also concluded the device was “viable and could have exploded.” “The target may have been an aircraft, and had it detonated, the aircraft could have been brought down,” she said. But earlier in the day, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House homeland security intelligence subcommittee, said that federal authorities indicated to him that the packages were probably intended to blow up the Jewish sites in Chicago rather than the cargo planes, since they do not carry passengers. Based on a conversation with Ms. Napolitano, he said that authorities were also leaving open the possibility that other packages with explosives had not yet been found. On Saturday, Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department’s chief spokesman, said that no specific threats had been made against synagogues or Jewish neighborhoods in the city, but that officers were watching them more closely as a precaution. It was a call from Mr. bin Nayef, the Saudi intelligence chief, on Thursday evening to John O. Brennan, the White House senior counterterrorism official and former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that set off the search, according to American officials. They said Mr. bin Nayef also notified C.I.A. officials in Riyadh.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/us/politics/31prexy.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Obama Walks Fine Political Line on Terror Threat<date>Published: October 30, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Trying to manage a terrorism threat in the middle of an election campaign, the Obama administration is walking a political and national security tightrope.Remembering the debates over whether President George W. Bush sought to capitalize on the terrorism threat in the days before the 2006 election, White House officials do not want to look as if they are seizing on a potential catastrophe to win votes. But at the same time, they remember when President Obama was criticized when he said nothing publicly in the three days after an attempt to blow up an airliner last Dec. 25. “Every president has to be able to take off the partisan hat and assume the role of nonpartisan commander in chief when there is a security incident,” said C. Stewart Verdery Jr., a former assistant secretary of homeland security under Mr. Bush. “The president should be the public face of the response to send the right signals to Americans worried about our defenses, especially those partisans who might be inclined to find fault with anything the administration does.” David Rothkopf, a national security expert who worked in the Clinton administration, said the president took the right action in making a swift public statement. “For Obama to wait longer, with real devices on their way to real places — he would have been open to criticism,” Mr. Rothkopf said. “I think the response was measured. It was not designed to produce panic. I also think, frankly, that the way it was done was quite tempered compared to past statements that we’ve seen during an election season.” White House officials say politics has nothing to do with the quick response, and that the scene of fighter jets accompanying a passenger plane from Dubai as it landed in New York on Friday was the result of an “abundance of caution.” “This has been handled just like any credible threat on any day,” Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Friday in an interview. Responding to a question from a reporter earlier in the day about whether the administration might be hyping the threat to sway the elections, Mr. Gibbs said that Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, briefed the president initially on Thursday night “off of very credible terror information.” He said that the discovery afterward of explosives on two cargo planes bound for the United States should “put to rest any speculation that may be out there.” After getting slammed for what critics complained was a slow public response to the Dec. 25 plot, administration officials, four days before the midterm elections, appeared determined not to make that mistake this time. Mr. Brennan said that while there were “similarities” between the interception of the explosives on Friday and the attempted bombing on Dec. 25, the two episodes were also “very different because you’re dealing with two packages as opposed to an individual.” The White House reaction contrasted with its response to the December scare, when a Nigerian aided by the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda tried to blow up an airliner over Detroit. While Mr. Obama was briefed repeatedly during a vacation in Hawaii, he did not address the episode in public until three days later, drawing criticism for not seeming to take it seriously enough. This time, not only did Mr. Obama make a public statement within hours of the news breaking, but his staff also made sure that influential Republicans, like Representative Peter T. King of New York, were kept informed. Mr. King, who was among the Republican lawmakers who expressed their dissatisfaction last year with the information they received about the December attempt, offered a more favorable initial reaction on Friday. “So far, everything has worked the right way,” he said. But some outside experts said it was risky for a president to come out as quickly as he did before all the facts were known. “You’re trying to look presidential and in command of all the facts and not look impotent,” said James Jay Carafano, a homeland security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “But on the other hand, you don’t want to step in it and do something stupid. Quite honestly, I don’t know why they had a press conference.” Moreover, Mr. Carafano said that Mr. Obama failed to use his remarks on Friday to justify the troop escalation in Afghanistan in an effort to keep the country from becoming a haven again for Al Qaeda. “The president missed the opportunity to say, ‘And this is why we’re in Afghanistan,’ ” Mr. Carafano said. But in many ways, it is Yemen, and not Afghanistan, that is increasingly being viewed as a bigger potential terrorist threat to the United States. One senior White House official noted Friday that the discovery of the explosives was the third terrorist attempt in less than two years that appeared to have a connection to Yemen. American officials say that Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born radical cleric now hiding in Yemen, played a direct role in the December airliner plot, and he has publicly called for more attacks on the United States. In addition, an Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., a year ago had exchanged e-mails with Mr. Awlaki beforehand. Juan Zarate, who was Mr. Bush’s deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism, said the interception of the explosives was different than the December plot, which stemmed from an intelligence and security breakdown and which challenged the administration’s response. “The administration has clearly learned the lessons that it is essential that the president and his team demonstrate that they are taking seriously the threat and allowing the CT professionals to do their work,” said Mr. Zarate, using the initials for counterterrorism. “My only concern is that we not overreact publicly at the highest levels every time there is a terrorist incident.” He added that the president should not feel compelled to jump every time Al Qaeda “says boo.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/world/middleeast/31petn.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Packages’ Explosive PETN Used in Past Plots<date>Published: October 30, 2010</date><text>Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, the explosive found in two bombs hidden in printer cartridges that were being shipped via jets from Yemen to the United States, is a hallmark of earlier Qaeda-linked terrorism attempts on airplanes.In 2001, PETN was found hidden in the shoes of Richard C. Reid during an American Airlines flight. Last Christmas, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had three ounces of PETN hidden in his underwear on a Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. An assassination attempt in August 2009 on Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, also employed PETN. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an arm of the terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the attack, which took the life of only one person, the suicide bomber’s. But other terrorist groups have also used PETN, and the presence of the explosive itself does not decisively point to Al Qaeda. “That’s a very common explosive,” said Jimmie C. Oxley, a professor of chemistry at the University of Rhode Island. “There’s no reason to think a lot of people didn’t have access to do that.” PETN, a white powder that was introduced after World War I, belongs to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. It is about 70 percent more powerful than T.N.T., and is stable. PETN generally does not explode when dropped or set on fire. Usually, a strong shock wave from a blasting cap or an exploding wire detonator is needed to set it off. Those properties make it well suited for a variety of commercial applications. PETN is a major ingredient of the plastic explosive Semtex and is used in detonation cables. For terrorists, PETN is an attractive choice for package bombs. Its stability means it is unlikely to explode prematurely, but at its destination, it will go off with deadly force when detonated. (Conversely, the stability of PETN also thwarted the attacks of Mr. Reid and Mr. Abdulmutallab, who were not able to detonate their explosives.) Dubai officials said that the printer cartridge bomb intercepted there on Friday included lead azide, an explosive to detonate the PETN, and a cellphone circuit, presumably to allow the bomb to be set off remotely. Neal Langerman, president of Advanced Chemical Safety, a consulting firm in San Diego, said it appeared “to be a fairly sophisticated device.” Judging from photos of the Dubai bomb, Dr. Oxley estimated that the printer cartridge contained about two pounds of PETN. The British home secretary, Theresa May, said Saturday that the second bomb, intercepted in Britain on Friday, contained enough explosive to bring down a plane. The target of the bombs remains unclear; they could have been directed at the synagogues or Jewish community centers in Chicago to which they were addressed. Placement of a bomb in a plane can be as important as its size in determining the amount of damage it could cause, Dr. Oxley said. While the printer cartridge contained more PETN than Mr. Reid’s shoes or Mr. Abdulmutallab’s underwear, the bomb maker could not be certain where in the airplane the package would be located. Mr. Reid and Mr. Abdulmutallab tried to detonate their devices close to the wall of the respective planes on which they were flying, to increase chances that the explosion would blow a hole in the aircraft. “Last year, the guy had more control,” Dr. Oxley said, referring to Mr. Abdulmutallab. But the printer cartridge bomb, she said, had so much more PETN that “my guess, and this is only a guess, it may have had a higher probability” of taking down an airplane. Dr. Langerman said it was curious that the two most recently intercepted devices apparently were different in design. That may indicate that the explosive makers had different targets in mind.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/us/31chicago.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Jews in Chicago Feel Safe, but Are Cautious<date>Published: October 30, 2010</date><text>CHICAGO — Even to a block that is arguably one of the safest and most secure in the country, the news that two parcels containing explosives were shipped from Yemen and addressed to synagogues or Jewish community centers in the city gave some residents pause on Saturday. “I’m not terribly worried — I heard on the 5 o’clock news that we weren’t one of the synagogues targeted,” said Alan Berger, a Hyde Park resident, as he arrived for services at KAM Isaiah Israel, a Reform congregation where he serves as secretary. “But the president does live across the street,” said Mr. Berger’s wife, Paula. “You never know if some crazy will attempt to blow up the people in the synagogue.” Reports that Chicago-area synagogues or Jewish community centers were likely targets of a terrorist attack and the return of President Obama to his hometown this weekend brought attention to the city’s security. But except for having to negotiate an extra layer of the already tight security in the neighborhood, the mood was calm among the dozen members of KAM Isaiah Israel, directly across the street from Mr. Obama’s home in Hyde Park/Kenwood, as prayer services wrapped up Saturday afternoon. Mr. Berger, 70, said he has planned taking extra time to reach the synagogue since Mr. Obama’s election, when the route came under regular surveillance by Chicago police officers and Secret Service agents, who usually stop cars and pedestrians entering the area. On Saturday afternoon, more than nine Chicago police cars joined half a dozen Secret Service vehicles stationed between Ellis and Greenwood Avenues. The streets around Mr. Obama’s house have been blocked off to pedestrian and car traffic other than residents since his election, and security is routinely stepped up when he is in town for an overnight stay. The president returned for a rally in Hyde Park Saturday evening, his first here since his Election Night celebration in 2008. “This is probably the safest place in the country to be today,” said Michael Rothschild, who was touring the neighborhood with his wife, Judith, on Saturday morning. “Having Obama’s house right by the synagogue, the odds of this one being bombed are much less because it is so fortified already.” Though federal investigators have not publicly identified the two synagogues that were targets, religious leaders and the local media have speculated that they were in Lakeview and Rogers Park, both neighborhoods on the city’s far North Side. The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed that KAM Isaiah Israel was not a target. Mr. Rothschild, a professor of business at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who has researched the likelihood of terrorist attacks on the United States, said the probability of an attack was still too low to deter him from visiting the president’s neighborhood. “People tend to overweight unusual events and underweight the things that are ordinary,” he said. The Chicago Police Department said in a news release on Friday that it was working with the Department of Homeland Security, the F.B.I. and the Joint Terrorism Task Force to protect the city and its residents. The police declined repeated requests for further comment by e-mail and phone Saturday afternoon. “The Secret Service is paying close attention to information we receive from the intelligence community at the local, state and national level,” said Ed Donovan, an agency spokesman. He would not comment on how the agency planned to maintain security in Chicago during the president’s visit. Andrea Maremont, 68, a North Side resident and member of Temple Sholom in Lakeview, said the threat did not worry her, despite her synagogue’s prominence and location near a lakefront highway. She said it was assumed that her synagogue was a target, “and we know we have to be on the alert. We just have to go about our business.” Rabbi Batsheva Appel of KAM Isaiah Israel echoed the cautious optimism of other members of the city’s Jewish community as she mingled with worshipers after services Saturday. “We do have a level of anxiety,” she said. “The news of packages destined for Chicago synagogues is very sad, but there is not much we can do except be careful.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/world/middleeast/31saudi.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Saudi Help in Package Plot Is Part of Security Shift<date>Published: October 30, 2010</date><text>BEIRUT, Lebanon — As new facts emerge about the terrorist plot to send explosives from Yemen to the United States by courier, one remarkable strand has stood out: the plot would likely not have been discovered if not for a tip by Saudi intelligence officials.For many in the West, Saudi Arabia remains better known as a source of terrorism than as a partner in defeating it. It is the birthplace of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Yet Western intelligence officials say the Saudis’ own experience with jihadists has helped them develop powerful surveillance tools and a broad network of informers that has become increasingly important in the global battle against terrorism. This month, Saudi intelligence warned of a possible terrorist attack in France by Al Qaeda’s branch in the Arabian Peninsula. The Saudis have brought similar intelligence reports about imminent threats to at least two other European countries in the past few years, and have played an important role in identifying terrorists in Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia and Kuwait, according to Saudi and Western intelligence officials. “This latest role is one in a series of Saudi intelligence contributions,” said Thomas Hegghammer, a research fellow at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment. “They can be helpful because so much is going on in their backyard, and because they have a limitless budget to develop their abilities.” The Saudis have stepped up their intelligence-gathering efforts in Yemen since last year, when Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula came close to assassinating Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, who runs the Saudi counterterrorism program. A suicide bomber posing as a reformed jihadist detonated a bomb hidden inside his body, cutting himself to shreds but only lightly injuring the prince. The Qaeda group’s main goal is to topple the Saudi monarchy, which they consider illegitimate and a slave to the West. Prince bin Nayef, whose tip to the United States led to the discovery of the two bombs on Thursday, is held in high esteem by Western intelligence agencies, and works closely with them. He appears to be building a network of informers across Yemen, and some terrorism analysts say they believe the tip may well have come from one of his spies, possibly even from inside Al Qaeda. “The Saudis have really stepped up their efforts in Yemen, and I’m under the impression that they’ve infiltrated Al Qaeda, so that they can warn the Americans, the French, the British and others about plots before they happen,” said Theodore Karasik, an analyst at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai. Saudi officials do not comment on delicate intelligence matters. But the Saudi role in a shadowy intelligence war in Yemen’s hinterlands has emerged in accounts from observers in Yemen and from Al Qaeda itself, which has often publicized its struggles to outwit Prince bin Nayef’s informers. Last year, Al Qaeda’s regional branch killed a Yemeni security official named Bassam Sulayman Tarbush and issued a video of Mr. Tarbush describing the Saudi informer network in Marib Province, a haven for Qaeda members east of Sana, the Yemeni capital. More recently, Al Qaeda released a video detailing its success in misleading Saudi informers during the assassination attempt against Prince bin Nayef. Saudi Arabia’s counterterrorism program differs from its Western counterparts in striking ways. It includes a familiar “hard” element of commando teams that kill terrorists, along with vastly expanded surveillance. The streets of major Saudi cities are continuously watched by cameras, and most Internet traffic goes through a central point that facilitates monitoring. But the program also has a softer side aimed at re-educating jihadists and weaving them back into Saudi society. The government runs a rehabilitation program for terrorists, including art therapy and efforts to find jobs and wives for the former convicts. The program suffered an embarrassment last year when two of its graduates, who had also been in Guantánamo, fled the country and became leading figures in Al Qaeda’s Arabian branch. But Saudi officials defend their overall record, noting that the program now has 349 graduates, of whom fewer than 20 have returned to terrorism. The Saudis’ growing expertise in counterterrorism has been the fruit of painful experience. Between 2003 and 2005, home-grown jihadists waged a brutal campaign of bombings in the kingdom, leaving scores of Saudis and foreigners dead and forcing the nation to wake up to a reality it had long refused to acknowledge. The puritanical strain of Islam fostered by the state, sometimes called Wahhabism, was breeding extremists who were willing to kill even Muslims for their cause. Saudi officials acknowledge that they still have a long way to go; the powerful religious establishment remains deeply conservative, and public schools continue to teach xenophobic and anti-Semitic material. But public opinion, once relatively supportive of figures like Mr. bin Laden, has shifted decisively since Al Qaeda began killing Muslims on Saudi soil. And when the Saudi Interior Ministry released its list of the top 85 wanted militants last year, all of them were said to be outside the kingdom, including some in Yemen. Saudi Arabia’s problem, in other words, has become the world’s problem.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/us/30cargo.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Explosives in Cargo Renew Debate on Screening<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>The discovery of two explosive devices shipped by cargo planes has reignited a long-running debate about how thoroughly cargo needs to be screened on its way into the United States.Despite the increased scrutiny of people and luggage on passenger planes since 9/11, there are far fewer safeguards for packages and bundles, particularly when loaded on cargo-only planes. The issue has come up in Congress repeatedly and was the subject of a recent report by the research arm of Congress that warned new mandates were not being met. Industry experts said the latest case suggested that terrorists may have singled out cargo aircraft precisely because they are not subject to the same scrutiny as passenger planes. Only a small percentage of all cargo from abroad is physically checked on freight planes bound for the United States. A law that took effect in August requiring full screening does not apply. “The 100 percent screening requirements only pertains to passenger flights that carry air cargo,” said Steve Lord, a director of homeland security and justice issues at the Government Accountability Office. The size of a package can determine whether it is physically checked. A legislative aide who has studied the issue said large packages were subject to a higher level of scrutiny, usually meaning they are opened, in an effort partly meant to detect stowaways. If a package makes an official suspicious, for instance if it is leaking or has protruding wires, it will be inspected, industry sources said. Sometimes, cargo on freight planes is tracked by only packing lists or manifests. All cargo on passenger planes, on the other hand, which carry about 16 percent of all cargo that comes into, leaves and travels within the United States, are bound by the August law to have physical inspections using technology and other means. Those screening measures are conducted by private contractors, officials of a foreign government or by American customs officials in some countries. In addition, planes carrying only freight that are scheduled to transfer to a passenger flight are subject to the full screening law. But as the G.A.O. noted in a June 2010 report, the federal government has yet to meet these requirements for inbound air cargo on passenger flights. “Even though it is subject to the law, it is not yet being screened 100 percent,” Mr. Lord said. “T.S.A. is still devising a system to screen this cargo. That is a potential vulnerability.” In a statement, the transportation administration said that it screens 100 percent of all cargo on domestic flights as well as 100 percent of what it described as "high-risk" international inbound air cargo packages on passenger planes. However, a T.S.A. official declined to say what percentage of cargo on international cargo flights is screened. Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who was an author of the August law, said, “Given the terrorist threats that we face, the need for continued vigilance is clear when it comes to cargo on aircraft.” Over all, 20 million pounds of cargo is transported on domestic and inbound passenger aircraft daily. Officials of both FedEx and United Parcel Service declined to provide details about their screening practices but said their procedures exceeded federal regulations. Both carriers said that they rely on contract carriers in Yemen and do not fly their own planes there. On Friday, the companies said that they had embargoed shipments from Yemen or suspended service from that country. The suspcious package intercepted in England was shipped through United Parcel Service. Karen Cole, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to say whether a company plane carried that package at any point in its route. Maury S. Lane, a spokesman for FedEx, said the carrier learned that a suspect package might be at its Dubai facility when it was contacted by the F.B.I. and local authorities in Dubai. “We were contacted, and the package was intercepted shortly afterwards,” Mr. Lane said. Michael D. Whatley, a partner at HBW Resources, which is a consulting firm for the Air Cargo Security Alliance, an organization that represents freight forwarders, said that there is no way to force American standards on other countries loading cargo bound for the United States. “That is a huge hole,” said Mr. Whatley. “So we have to rely on international treaties and bilateral negotiations and all the different tools that we have as a country to get the other countries to do it on their territory.” Aviation officials have been under Congressional pressure for nearly a decade to ensure that air cargo loaded onto passenger planes is checked for possible explosives. Critics have argued it made no sense for the United States to have spent billions of dollars to examine all carry-on bags and checked baggage but allow cargo to be loaded onto passenger planes without scrutiny. Congress, frustrated with the progress, mandated in 2007 that the Transportation Security Administration take steps to ensure that all air cargo on passenger planes be inspected — on domestic flights and international flights headed to the United States — by August 2010. Homeland Security recently acknowledged it would not meet the deadline for international cargo. Earlier this year, Gale D. Rossides, then acting director of the Transportation Security Administration, , told a House committee that about 80 to 85 percent of international cargo headed for passenger planes would be inspected as of the August deadline, and cited the difficulty of getting certain international airports to comply. “We’re visiting these countries,” Ms. Rossides told a House Homeland Security subcommittee in June. “We’re giving them our standards. We’re assisting them with teams of T.S.A. experts.” The G.A.O. audit said that part of the problem is that the Transportation Security Administration as of earlier this year had not approved the use of devices to screen large pallets or containers of cargo. A significant amount of air cargo headed to the United States is also given an exemption from screening if it is in shrink-wrapped bundles, based on an assumption that the shipper knows the contents are secure, the audit said. Perhaps more troubling, the audit found that the agency could not say for sure that air carriers are complying with the mandates to screen cargo even at airports where the system is supposedly in place. The inspections are done by private companies, not government security officers, and the federal government does not have a reliable way to monitor the process.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/world/middleeast/30yemen.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Yemen Emerges as Base for Al Qaeda Attacks<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>BEIRUT, Lebanon — Not long ago, most Americans had scarcely heard of Yemen, the arid, Texas-size country in the southern corner of the Arabian peninsula.But on Friday, as news emerged of a plot to send explosives in courier packages from Yemen to synagogues in Chicago, the world’s attention was focused once again on the threats brewing in Yemen’s lawless, strife-torn hinterlands, where American citizens appear to be helping the local branch of Al Qaeda take aim at the United States. It was the second time in less than a year: on Dec. 25, a Nigerian trained in Yemen tried to detonate a bomb on a commercial flight as it approached Detroit, and Al Qaeda took credit for the attempt. The American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had been in contact with the would-be bomber, and some analysts believe the latest effort may also be linked to Mr. Awlaki, a charismatic preacher who remains in hiding in Yemen and has issued threats by Internet. In recent months, American intelligence officials have grown increasingly concerned about Yemen, despite a renewed cooperation on counterterrorism with the Yemeni authorities in the past year. Al Qaeda’s regional arm, which went quiet for several months after a series of American airstrikes in Yemen that began last December, has become more active since the spring, and has killed several dozen Yemeni soldiers and police officers. The group has also stepped up its recruitment drive on the Internet, issuing an English-language magazine that includes articles with titles like “Make a Bomb in Your Mother’s Kitchen.” The most recent issue of the magazine, “Inspire,” was published last month and includes an article by an American citizen named Samir Khan titled “I am Proud to be a Traitor to America.” Mr. Khan, who grew up in North Carolina and New York City, is believed to have joined Al Qaeda’s Yemeni branch last year. One important reason for the rising concern about Yemen is the presence of Americans like Mr. Awlaki and Mr. Khan. It is not clear how many Americans are working with Al Qaeda in Yemen, a group that is believed to comprise several hundred members, including some from Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. The group is mostly based in the lawless provinces to the east of Yemen’s capital, Sana, but has carried out attacks in the capital as well. “These are people with both access to explosives and knowledge of how the United States works,” said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University who has written on Yemen. “And in Yemen, you can walk into a local branch of FedEx and mail something to the U.S. You can’t do that in Somalia or in rural Afghanistan.” Al Qaeda’s Yemen-based branch, which calls itself Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, does not consider the United States a key target, intelligence officials and analysts say. The group has tried repeatedly to strike at Saudi Arabia, and says it aims to topple the Yemeni and Saudi governments. But attacking the United States draws broader publicity, and may be helpful with recruiting. Al Qaeda’s regional arm took credit for a suicide attack on the American Embassy in Sana in September 2008 that left 16 people dead, including the six attackers. There have been other, less deadly attacks on other foreign embassies in Yemen’s capital. The United States government’s relationship with Yemen has been troubled by mutual suspicion. The country has long been a haven for jihadists, who were welcomed there after returning from fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Yemeni government cracked down on many jihadists, but also maintained relationships with them, paroling some convicted terrorists and cultivating radical clerics. American officials complained; Yemeni officials defended their approach as necessary pragmatism in a country where hard-line Islamist views are common. Last year American officials showed Yemen’s longtime president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, intelligence reports indicating that Al Qaeda was singling out him and his family members, many of whom hold senior government positions. After that, Mr. Saleh redoubled his commitment to fighting Al Qaeda, and allowed the United States to launch airstrikes on Yemeni terrain. But Al Qaeda’s presence has also led the United States to vastly increase its military and economic assistance to Yemen, and many Yemeni and American analysts say they fear that Mr. Saleh has a financial interest in maintaining some level of threat in his country. Another source of concern is the rising chaos of Yemen, which has a fast-growing, desperately poor population of 23 million and is running out of water. The country’s meager oil reserves, a key source of revenue for the government, are also running dry. The government has limited control outside of major cities, where powerful tribes hold sway and are sometimes willing to shelter Qaeda members. An intermittent rebellion in Yemen’s northwest has created a humanitarian crisis; in the south, a secessionist movement has fostered an increasingly lawless environment where Al Qaeda appears to be flourishing. Although Al Qaeda has not claimed credit for the packages that were bound for Chicago, this latest episode “is a reminder that we have a serious problem brewing in Yemen, and the current counterterrorism measures have not been able to stop it,” said Gregory Johnsen, an expert on Yemen at Princeton University.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/business/23ups.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S., Encouraged, Raises Earnings Outlook<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, said Thursday that its second-quarter net income increased 90 percent and raised its earnings outlook for the year, citing encouraging indications of future global trade.Increases in its international business, particularly from Asia, raised the volume of its export shipments by 15 percent. “Our approach to international expansion using alliances, service partners and acquisitions has proved to be successful,” the chief executive, D. Scott Davis, said during a conference call with analysts. The company had an overall 7 percent increase in its revenue per freight piece because of heavier average shipment weight, higher prices and fuel surcharge increases. Mr. Davis said that despite expectations for a slow recovery in the United States and the uncertain economic outlook in Europe, “we are more confident than we were earlier in the year in U.P.S.’s ability to grow and generate substantial profits.” The company raised its forecast for full-year profit to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 a share from the outlook of $3.05 to $3.30 a share it forecast with its first-quarter results. Analysts said the improved forecast was a factor in a rally in its stock price, which rose $3.14, or 5.2 percent, to $63.15 a share. The company reported net income of $845 million, or 84 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $445 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue was $12.2 billion, up from $10.8 billion. Income per share was better than the 77 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, and revenue topped the forecast of $11.96 billion. While U.P.S. reported an improvement in all business segments, including a 57 percent increase in its domestic segment operating profit to $748 million, its average daily package volume increased only 1.2 percent. “We are not yet where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction,” Mr. Davis said about domestic segment profit, which was hurt in part by a decline in its letter delivery business. Kurt Kuehn, the chief financial officer, attributed the decline in domestic letter deliveries in part to fewer new-home sales and mortgage refinancings. Kevin W. Sterling, transportation services analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets, said time-sensitive financial and legal documents in those areas were a large component of next-day letter delivery. Mr. Sterling said U.P.S. and FedEx, which announced its fourth-quarter profit last month, presented similar outlooks for modest global economic growth, driven in part by Asia. Analysts follow the two companies, which survey customer shipping needs, as a proxy for overall economic health. “If you’re looking to gauge the global and domestic economy, look no further than U.P.S. and FedEx,” Mr. Sterling said. While Mr. Davis said he anticipated a business-led recovery, Mr. Sterling said he would be cautiously watching consumer activity around the back-to-school and early holiday seasons. “Right now they’re seeing strong trends, but no one knows what August and September hold,” said Mr. Sterling. “If the fall peak shipping season is strong, it usually means retailers are doing a little bit better and consumers are spending.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16fri3.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">What About Air Safety?<date>Published: July 15, 2010</date><text>Last year’s crash of a commuter plane near Buffalo, which killed 50 people, highlighted the need for more stringent pilot training and tougher rules about how long pilots can fly before they are required to rest. Those reforms have been irresponsibly sidetracked by one of Capitol Hill’s nastiest and most expensive lobbying fights over the unrelated issue of unionization rules at the rival delivery companies, FedEx and United Parcel Service. The complex bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration would require more hours in training for commercial pilots and a closer watch on their flight schedules. The House and Senate have passed versions of the reauthorization with the sensible new safety rules. But the legislation has stalled as the two corporations and their hugely well-paid lobbyists battle over whether the unionization standards for U.P.S. package deliverers should also be applied to FedEx’s ground workers. The nation is fortunate that the standoff has now galvanized a less dollar-driven lobbying force — the families of the victims in last year’s tragedy. They are buttonholing lawmakers with a question: What’s happening with passenger safety? The House’s aviation bill, led by Representative James Oberstar, a Democrat of Minnesota and a union champion, would finally put the two companies on the same footing. Mr. Oberstar argues adamantly that a Republican Congress unfairly allowed FedEx special antiunion protections in 1996, and this needs to be corrected. The Senate-passed measure has no such provision. And a filibuster is threatened to protect FedEx by Senators Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, Republicans of Tennessee, where, of course, FedEx is based. Far more than parochial posturing is at stake in the bill, which also includes modernization of the air traffic control system. Both sides remain unyielding on the union fight. We sympathize with Representative Oberstar’s point and find the filibuster threat on behalf of FedEx shameless. Congress needs to rise above this to serve the one special interest most at stake: air passenger safety.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/business/03ups.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S.

United Parcel will reduce its American regions to three from five and its districts to 20 from 46 in April. There are no plans to close any operating facilities. The company said the consolidation of offices would not affect the sales and operations team, including drivers. It expects to incur a one-time charge in 2010 because of the reorganization. The company now expects earnings of 73 to 75 cents a share for the October-to-December quarter. It had previously predicted earnings of 58 to 65 cents a share. The company is to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 2. “The stronger earnings stem from better-than-expected results in both domestic and international operations and savings through cost management,” the chief financial officer, Kurt Kuehn, said in a statement. “However, we still anticipate a gradual economic recovery with improvement more evident as 2010 progresses.” Shares of United Parcel rose $2.76, to $60.17.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/nyregion/21ups.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Paying More to Send U.S. Mail at U.P.S. Stores<date>Published: December 20, 2009</date><text>Shipping at Christmas is a hectic thing, enough to give Santa migraines. So it is no surprise that many people avoid lines at the post office for the one-stop convenience of a U.P.S. Store, where one can send things by United States mail as well as by parcel post. At some U.P.S. Store franchises in Manhattan, however, clerks do not always tell customers that they may be paying a Grinch-like surcharge when they send something by the United States mail. Posing as customers, reporters for The New York Times visited several U.P.S. stores last week looking to mail an item by Priority Mail  one of the postal service’s signature offerings. In nearly every instance, they were quoted prices well above the government postal rate, and only one of them was told they were paying a premium for the convenience of using a U.P.S. Store. One store on the Upper East Side said it would cost $21 to send an eight-pound package by Priority Mail to Old Greenwich, Conn. The clerk suggested using U.P.S. Ground instead for $19.90. At the post office across the street, the same package cost $8.80 to ship. Each arrived in two days. “U.P.S. stores are allowed to have any kind of markup they want,” said the store’s owner, Shawn Choudhury. He is right; they can. It is all part of the odd, co-dependent rivalry between U.P.S. and the United States Postal Service, which for years have shared resources even as they compete for customers. The U.P.S. Store retail chain is a prime example. The stores are individually owned and promote themselves as more than shipping outlets, offering business services like copying, printing and office supplies, along with postal services. For the store owner, it is another way to get customers in the door. For the post office, it is a way to increase its volume. No rules govern how much a U.P.S. Store can charge for postal services, or mandate that it tell customers that it is adding a surcharge. The only notice the reporters found was a notation on the receipt that reads “U.S. Postal Rates Are Subject to Surcharge,” though with no indication of what the markup is. Several consumer advocates said they did not know of the U.P.S. practice. “I think there’s a natural assumption on the part of the consumer that if you’re sending something through the U.S. Postal Service, even when it’s from another store, you’re not paying more, and if you are paying more, it’s just a pittance,” said Tod Marks, a senior editor at Consumer Reports. Rich Hallibrin, a spokesman for Mail Boxes Etc., the U.P.S. subsidiary that franchises the stores, said the company urged its retail owners to be “as forthright as possible” in explaining their prices. “We can’t mandate it,” he said, “but we would certainly hope they are open and honest with their customers to avoid any confusion after the sale.” The U.P.S. Store central Web site promotes its postal service offerings but does not mention that they could include an extra charge. Mr. Hallibrin said that is because not every store charges a surcharge. “We have more than 4,000 centers,” he said. “We can’t make blanket statements and say you’re going to pay a premium when you’re not.” Dave Lewin, a post office spokesman, said U.P.S. store owners were within their rights to charge “whatever the market will bear.” But, he said, “customers should be told upfront about any service charges a retailer might add to the postage for Postal Service products and services.” The Times found that the cost could vary sharply from block to block. Mr. Choudhury, owner of the Upper East Side store at 1636 Third Avenue, said he typically tacked on a 25 to 36 percent increase to Postal Service prices on items sent by Priority Mail. “Anything above that would be kind of outrageous, and people would probably get mad,” he said. But on a reporter’s visit to the store, Mr. Choudhury quoted a price 140 percent higher. Two days later he charged another reporter $9.90 to send a book that cost $5.50 to send from the Yorkville Station post office across the street, an 80 percent markup. That did not include $2.89 for the envelope. The post office envelope was free. Asked about the charges, Mr. Choudhury declined to say why he had gone above what he had said was his standard. He said he always told customers about the surcharge, though he had not told either reporter. Pressed about this, he said, “Everyone knows that.” The story was the same at other stores: At 217 East 86th Street, an 85 percent markup; at 1357 Broadway in Midtown, 70 percent; at Eighth Avenue and 27th Street in Chelsea, 50 percent. The best price  a 10 percent markup  was at 1324 Lexington Avenue, a few blocks from Mr. Choudhury’s store. The Chelsea store was the only one that volunteered the fact that there was a surcharge, but only after initially insisting it did not offer Priority Mail. Often, the quoted Postal Service price seemed to come in slightly below or above the U.P.S. Ground price, which frequently served, as reporters found, as a chance for the store workers to pitch the U.P.S. product instead. “It’s about the same price but you get a tracking number,” one clerk said. Mr. Marks of Consumer Reports called such surcharges an example of caveat emptor  “especially at a time of year when most consumers are extremely vulnerable.” But Symone, who said she was the acting manager of the store in Chelsea but refused to give her last name, offered a different lesson: “You’re not going to go to a McDonald’s to ask about Wendy’s.” Colin Moynihan and Rebecca White contributed reporting.

Next week, the company plans to deliver packages they have not ordered, in a test of an effort to expand into direct marketing. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image United Parcel Service will begin testing its direct marketing service on Monday. Add to Portfolio United Parcel Service Inc Go to your Portfolio » Beginning on Monday, U.P.S. will experiment in five major markets with a service it calls Direct to Door, giving advertisers and retailers a chance to provide offers and product samples to U.P.S. customers. The marketing materials will come inside small boxes labeled Direct to Door Paks, and will be delivered to customers along with merchandise they actually ordered. The test, to run through Oct. 2, is intended to gauge whether there is interest in having U.P.S. serve as an alternative to marketing mail delivered by the United States Postal Service or by companies like Valpak. If Direct to Door goes forward, the added revenue could help United Parcel offset declines in demand for its mainstay package delivery service since the recession started. In July, U.P.S. reported its sixth consecutive quarter of lower package volume in this country. The decline in the second quarter was 4.6 percent compared with the period a year earlier, which Bloomberg News described as the worst result since United Parcel went public in 1999. “I wouldn’t say it was developed as a result of the economy,” said Lisa Lynn, marketing director for new-product research and development at United Parcel in Atlanta. Rather, she said, it stems from “some opportunity we saw at the heart of what we do every day working off our delivery network.” The test is also meant to see if U.P.S. customers welcome unsolicited packages or dismiss them as some new type of junk mail. One effect of the economy is that “people are very receptive to offers right now,” Ms. Lynn said. An experiment in figuring out how to better aim traditional, tangible marketing materials at consumers may seem quaint when so much of the buzz along Madison Avenue is about aiming virtual pitches at them online. But direct marketing remains a lucrative business. According to the Direct Marketing Association, it accounted for $176.9 billion in ad spending last year in the United States  52.1 percent of the total, by the association’s tally. “We did some focus-group research and it really indicated that people were receptive to receiving offers from U.P.S.,” Ms. Lynn said. “What we heard was, ‘If U.P.S. brings it to me, it’s not junk.’ ” Still, the company is taking several steps to try to ensure that a Direct to Door Pak is received more like a gift than another application for another credit card. For one thing, the offers inside each box are intended to be special rather than “mass offers distributed through other channels,” Ms. Lynn said. For another, no Direct to Door Paks will be delivered unaccompanied by packages ordered by that household, she said. And the boxes will not bear the addresses of the recipients, Ms. Lynn said. Rather, they will carry phrases like this one: “Inside are premium offers from some of America’s best-known brands.” They will also include a photograph of the familiar brown United Parcel truck next to the words “Delivered to you by U.P.S.” About a dozen companies  advertisers and retailers that use United Parcel to deliver orders to customers  are taking part in the test, Ms. Lynn said. They include the Finish Line; Men’s Wearhouse; Sephora; two Williams-Sonoma home furnishings brands, Pottery Barn and West Elm; and Zappos.com, the online retailer of shoes and housewares recently acquired by Amazon. “It’s an interesting way to reach out to our customers and partner with one of our closest business partners,” said Aaron Magness, director for business development and brand marketing at Zappos.com in Henderson, Nev. “We are an online retailer,” he added, “but we want to maintain a high-touch relationship with customers, constantly trying to find different ways to interact with them in whatever means they’re comfortable with.” Mr. Magness said he liked the idea that the boxes would not arrive “out of nowhere, from random people knocking on your door.” The offer to be made by Zappos.com during the test will invite recipients to “become a member of our V.I.P. program,” he added, entitling them to “free next-business-day shipping on every order.” United Parcel plans to deliver about 250,000 Direct to Door Paks in about 150 ZIP codes in Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, Phoenix and Washington. Those chosen to participate in the test are “high-opportunity consumers,” Ms. Lynn said, meaning that they often order merchandise delivered by United Parcel Service. “Our drivers have relationships with these people because they deliver to them frequently,” she added. “There’s a lot of trust in the driver and the brand.” Mr. Magness also cited the trust factor as a reason Zappos.com was interested in the test. Ms. Lynn described the customers to receive Direct to Door Paks as ages 35 to 54 in households of two persons or larger and living in single-family, owner-occupied homes. As for what the service will cost marketers, “I can’t go into specific pricing,” Ms. Lynn said, “but the pricing model is similar to other media.” The goal is for the cost to reach each 1,000 consumers  a common media measurement known as cpm  to be “comparable or less than an equivalent piece of direct mail,” she added.

Is Sued Over Disabilities Policy<date>Published: August 29, 2009</date><text>A federal agency has sued United Parcel Service, accusing it of violating federal law by limiting workers' ability to take medical leave. In a lawsuit filed Thursday in a federal court in Chicago, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said U.P.S. had since at least 2002 had an ''inflexible'' 12-month leave policy that did not provide for ''reasonable accommodation'' for disabled employees and instead called for their termination. The agency accused UPS of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and federal civil rights law. It brought the case on behalf of Trudi Momsen, a former U.P.S. worker with multiple sclerosis who it said was fired in 2007 rather than being given extended leave or a new position. A spokesman for U.P.S., Norman Black, called the lawsuit ''surprising and misdirected.'' He said the E.E.O.C. had chosen to attack ''one of the more generous and flexible leave policies in corporate America.'' He also said Ms. Momsen had never asked for an accommodation under the federal disability law, and upon returning from a nearly yearlong paid leave, worked for just 18 days before she ''abandoned her position.'' Ms. Momsen could not immediately be reached for comment.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/24parcel.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S.

Second-quarter profit declined to $445 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $873 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped 17 percent, to $10.8 billion. Package volume in the United States slid for a sixth consecutive quarter as the recession caused businesses to reduce orders amid the highest unemployment rate in 26 years. The company said shipments would remain “significantly below” those for last year. U.P.S. is considered an economic bellwether because it delivers a wide variety of items, including clothing, auto parts and financial documents. “A lot of us got excited by those initial signs of stabilization, and now we’re realizing it’s going to be more of a 2010 event before we see real recovery,” said Nathan Brochmann, an analyst at William Blair &amp; Company in Chicago. He rates the shares market perform. U.P.S., based in Atlanta, said profit for the three months through September will be 45 to 55 cents a share, less than the 60-cent average of analysts’ estimates. “We are cautious, frankly,” the company’s chief financial officer Kurt Kuehn told analysts and investors on a conference call. “We don’t have any confidence that either demand or activity is going to pick up substantially” in the next several months. Domestic volume fell 4.6 percent in the second quarter, the worst results since the company’s 1999 initial public offering. The measure will probably decline at a similar pace this quarter, Mr. Kuehn said. International volume tumbled 5.5 percent and will not improve this quarter, he said. The number of hours U.P.S. airplanes were in operation declined 11 percent, saving 14 million gallons of fuel and contributing to a 54 percent drop in the company’s total fuel bill to $539 million as oil prices collapsed from a year earlier.

Maury Lane, a FedEx spokesman, said that he thought that explanation was “disingenuous” and that it was implausible to contend that Mr. Keene had acted in his individual capacity. He noted that the July 15 letter supporting UPS in the dispute included the ACU logo in the letterhead along with those of six other conservative groups and that Mr. Keene’s signature noted he was president of the American Conservative Union. The initial letter from the ACU was written by Mr. Whitfield, and it proposed to a FedEx vice president in the Washington office, Rick Rodgers, an elaborate campaign of building support. “We stand with FedEx in opposition to this legislation,” Mr. Whitfield wrote in a reference to a bill that would change labor law and expand organized union influence across the FedEx empire. Mr. Whitfield, who was a deputy labor secretary in the Reagan administration, wrote, “We support America’s businesses and entrepreneurs,” and “we would like to work with you” to eliminate the proposed provision that would increase union power at FedEx. Mr. Whitfield proposed contacting 150,000 people at least seven times about the supposed dangers of the legislation, at a cost of $2.15 million. The other costs would be for a radio campaign. FedEx declined, Mr. Lane said. Then, on July 15, the letter from a coalition of groups supporting UPS in the dispute was sent to Frederick W. Smith, the FexEx chairman, with the ACU logo and Mr. Keene’s signature. Mr. Whitfield said Friday in his statement that “ACU’s positions on important policy issues have never been for sale,” and that the group “stands with the policy that FedEx should not be placed under” the National Labor Relations Board as provided for in the legislation FedEx is opposing.

More Politics News In a letter sent last month to FedEx, the group offered its support in a bitter legislative dispute with United Parcel Service, but said it wanted a contract of up to $3.4 million to wage a campaign to win support for FedEx’s position. When FedEx did not agree, executives at the company said, the conservative group’s chairman, David A. Keene, turned around and signed a letter using the group’s logo endorsing the UPS view and blasting FedEx.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp United Parcel Service Inc Go to your Portfolio » In a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign introduced Tuesday, FedEx objected to legislation that would make it easier to unionize the company by accusing its rival, United Parcel Service, of taking a government bailout. The FedEx-sponsored Web site BrownBailout.com (brown is both U.P.S.’s color and nickname) says that U.P.S. is “quietly seeking a Congressional bailout designed to limit competition for overnight deliveries.” Along with a “bailout-o-meter” showing U.P.S.’s revenue, and a spoof of a U.P.S. commercial, the site includes statements like, “This is a bailout, plain and simple, and the American people won’t stand for it.” The real issue here is not government-supplied cash for U.P.S., but the labor laws under which U.P.S. and FedEx are classified. The House recently approved a bill that reclassified a FedEx division, making it easier for unions to form there, and FedEx is fighting that legislation as it goes to the Senate. In effect, FedEx is claiming that passage of the bill would be a bailout for U.P.S. by hampering a competitor. FedEx’s casting of a labor-law dispute as a bailout has raised ire at U.P.S. and at the Teamsters union, which said on Tuesday that it planned to respond with its own public relations campaign.  Some advertising experts said FedEx was putting its own brand at risk by so aggressively attacking a competitor and accusing U.P.S. of taking a federal bailout. “Hinging so much of this  even the site itself and the URL name  to a bailout brings some pretty significant risks,” said Scott Elser, a partner in LaunchPad Advertising, which is not working with either company. “It’s arguably one of the most controversial terms that you can define in politics today. They draw you there based on that, and you don’t have to surf very long to realize that this is clearly not a bailout as most consumers and business people would define it, which is writing a check to a troubled business.” “It’s a little bit of a bait and switch,” Mr. Elser said, which “has the ability to potentially harm their brand.” FedEx is objecting to a provision in a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that the House passed in May. The legislation would classify nonairline employees from FedEx’s Express division, which makes overnight deliveries, under the National Labor Relations Act rather than the Railway Labor Act, which currently governs Express as well as airlines and railroads. The reclassification would make it easier to unionize the division, since N.L.R.A. unions are allowed to form at a company’s individual sites; under the railway act, unions need national support from a majority of a company’s workers. U.P.S., which is heavily unionized, is governed under the N.L.R.A. And it has been lobbying to get its competitor’s Express division classified under that act. “FedEx is appearing to spend millions of dollars to try to convince Congress that a FedEx driver delivering a package is different from a U.P.S. driver delivering a package,” said Malcolm Berkley, a U.P.S. spokesman. Mr. Berkley said it was a competitive issue for U.P.S. “FedEx Express uses the fact of the labor law it is currently under inappropriately as a lever when talking to U.P.S. customers, particularly when we’re negotiating our contracts,” he said. FedEx’s labeling of the legislation as a bailout was wrong, he said. “There’s clearly no way we’re seeking a bailout. In fact, what we’re doing is working to eliminate an earmark that has been given to FedEx for some years,” he said. Executives from the Teamsters, which represents 240,000 U.P.S. workers, also said the bailout campaign was misleading. “It is just the height of hypocrisy for them to allege that there is a bailout of their competitor, when in fact, it’s the company, it’s FedEx, who has benefited from this misclassification of their workers,” said Ken Hall, international vice president and director of the package division at the Teamsters. “It’s laughable to think that they would portray this as some bailout. This is simply leveling the playing field.” While Mr. Berkley said U.P.S. was not planning a campaign in response, the Teamsters would, Mr. Hall said. “Particularly, it’s going to be a grass-roots and an educational program to make sure that those folks in Congress truly understand the issue.” FedEx, meanwhile, has been arguing that the different classification makes sense, since its roots and ways of doing business are different from those of U.P.S. “Our company and U.P.S. are fundamentally different companies,” said Maury Lane, director of communications at FedEx. “They aren’t and shouldn’t be regulated the same way.” As for the bailout characterization, “that piece of legislation only helps one company while hurting a main competitor  if that’s not a bailout, we’re going to have to redefine the word,” he said. Late last year, FedEx’s chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, signaled the company would fight hard against any potential legislation. “We’ve said repeatedly that it is extremely bad public policy,” Mr. Smith said in a conference call with investors. “We would hope that provision would not see the light of day.” Labor experts differed on the companies’ positions. Karen E. Boroff, the dean of the Stillman School of Business at Seton Hall University, said she found FedEx’s arguments persuasive. “FedEx absolutely has a right to be concerned about tiny little bargaining units interrupting the flow of their delivery,” she said. And, she said, workers doing similar jobs were often classified under different labor laws. But James J. Brudney, a law professor at the Moritz College of Law at the Ohio State University, said that FedEx Express’s classification was “a historical anomaly.” “From the workers’ point of view, it seems unfair,” he said.  Advertising executives who reviewed the Web site said that it did some things very well. “I give them credit for inventiveness,” said Steve Centrillo, a principal at A-Team Advisors, a consultant to advertising agencies that is based in New York. Pinning the problems on U.P.S. rather than on unionization helped FedEx avoid sticky labor relations questions, he said. But, Mr. Centrillo said, the use of bailout was “the most questionably ethical thing on the site. “It’s taking a word that is extremely loaded right now, and implying that somehow, the government is writing a check to U.P.S., which is clearly not the case.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on June 10, 2009, on page B10 of the New York edition.THE word bailout has gone from descriptive to derogatory.

U.P.S. said that its second-quarter results would probably fall below analysts’ expectations and that while the economic recovery could begin by the end of this year, it would more likely come in 2010. “The results are miserable, but we expected misery,” said Dan Ortwerth, an analyst at Edward Jones. “And all bets are off as to when that misery will end.” The company reported first-quarter net income of $401 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $906 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier.

A new campaign conjures up a world where just about everything in sight is cardboard -- and that’s meant to be a good thing. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Add to Portfolio United Parcel Service Inc Go to your Portfolio » The campaign, now under way, promotes the UPS Store retail chain, whose locations are franchised by the Mail Boxes Etc. subsidiary of UPS (United Parcel Service). The campaign, with a budget estimated at more than $30 million, takes a cardboard-centric view to convey that shipping, as symbolized by the familiar UPS cardboard box, is just the start of the offerings at the UPS Store, which also include postal services and business services like copying, printing and office supplies. The goal is to introduce the UPS Store to new customers as well as to nudge current customers into spending more on additional services. That is a challenge in the crowded category in which the UPS Store competes, which also includes FedEx Office, formerly FedEx Kinko’s; Office Depot; OfficeMax; Postal Annex; PostNet; Staples; and, of course, the United States Postal Service. The initial television commercial in the UPS Store campaign, which began running on March 29, sets the tone for the effort. Elaborate special effects present a cardboard man, the owner of a small business, fighting a cardboard gladiator and cardboard lions in a cardboard rendition of a coliseum. An employee from the UPS Store assists him in his battle, which is revealed to be taking place inside a cardboard box on the counter at a UPS Store. In addition to commercials, the campaign also includes radio, print and online ads. The campaign is being created by Doner in Southfield, Mich., which also created the previous campaign for the UPS Store, centered on the Stevie Wonder song “Don’t You Worry ’Bout a Thing.” The celebration of cardboard makes sense when considering how important it is to the UPS Store as well as parent UPS. But it is unusual because cardboard is typically the goat in advertising, not the hero. For instance, a campaign that began on Saturday for the Chili’s restaurant chain features a make-believe competitor named P.J. Bland’s, which serves cardboard food. Not food that tastes like cardboard  food that is made of cardboard. Chili’s interrupts what appear to be sales spiels from P.J. Bland’s by declaring, “Life’s too short for bland food.” The Chili’s campaign is by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. And a campaign for Kashi food products, sold by a division of the Kellogg Company, includes print ads with headlines like this one: “Our crackers don’t taste like a mouthful of cardboard. Hmmm ... wonder why?” The answer, according to the ads, is the ingredients in Kashi crackers like cheese, basil and tomatoes. The Kashi campaign is by Amazon Advertising in San Francisco. “We’re utilizing the cardboard box as a way to talk about everything we do,” says Tom Crockett, vice president for worldwide sales and marketing at the UPS Store and Mail Boxes Etc. in San Diego. (UPS bought Mail Boxes Etc. and changed the names of almost all the retail outlets to the UPS Store.) The campaign about the UPS Store alleviating worry “did a very good job for us,” Mr. Crockett says, “but it doesn’t get across the message that we do more than shipping as strongly as we felt we needed to.” In research, “the one thing we kept finding,” he adds, was that even customers of the UPS Store “were surprised at what we did” beyond shipping. So the different elements of the campaign make sure to deliver in many ways the idea that the UPS Store is, well, not just for shipping anymore, to borrow a theme of a famous pitch for orange juice. For instance, the television commercial about the gladiatorial fight ends with a real UPS Store employee telling a real customer, “Hey, we do a lot more than shipping.” In a radio commercial, also with a plot about a gladiator battle, a UPS Store worker tells a customer, “I’ll help you print out all those documents you need for your client meeting.” The customer replies: “The UPS Store? But you guys just ship stuff.” The worker responds, “We do a lot more than shipping.” And the text of a print ad, which depicts an entire city constructed of cardboard, begins, “We do more than shipping.” The text ends with this sentence: “No matter how big, small or complex the job, at the UPS Store, we can help.” The underlying purpose of the campaign, according to executives at Doner, is to present the UPS Store to busy owners of small businesses as the one convenient, reliable place for all their myriad needs. “It’s something big to work off,” Greg Gerfen, executive vice president and account management director at Doner, said of the idea that the UPS Store provides “one-stop shopping.” The agency’s creative staff members looked at several ways to bring the idea to life, says Jimmy Kollin, vice president and creative director, before hitting on the cardboard concept. “It’s using the one thing they’re known for to promote all the other things they do,” Mr. Kollin says, “happening in a real box, on a real counter, in a real UPS Store.” “The cardboard-world message also had to be one of empowerment,” he adds, so the UPS Store employee is always providing the various services that assist the customer in doing whatever needs to be done. The device of the cardboard world can also “make the campaign interesting, dramatic, fun,” Mr. Kollin says, as the ads explore “fantastical, epic ideas.” Potential next worlds in the campaign could include the Wild West or a tempest-tossed ocean. “The cardboard world gives us limitless opportunities,” Mr. Kollin says. “We could do anything in cardboard.” To help bring the first cardboard world of the coliseum to life, Doner brought in Psyop, an agency in New York, to produce the computer-generated effects for the television commercial and online ads. The campaign is so faithful to its cardboard construct that the sound effects in the campaign are derived from cardboard, Mr. Kollin says, “in place of percussive instruments.” Elias Arts in Santa Monica, Calif., used cardboard boxes and mailing tubes to produce sounds like a lion’s roar, which was achieved with cardboard being torn. The television part of the campaign is running nationally and locally. The print ads are appearing in magazines like Entrepreneur, Fortune Small Business and Martha Stewart Living. The online ads are on Web sites like americangreetings.com, cnn.com, msn.com and realsimple.com as well as on the Web site of the UPS Store (theupsstore.com).  If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

The online ads are on Web sites like americangreetings.com, cnn.com, msn.com and realsimple.com as well as on the Web site of the UPS Store (theupsstore.com).  If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/business/04ups.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">U.P.S.

In its earnings report, U.P.S. said its profit for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 was $254 million, or 25 cents a share. That compares with a loss of $2.6 billion, or $2.52 a share, for the same period a year ago when the company took a big charge related to a shift to a new pension plan for some employees. Excluding one-time charges, U.P.S. said quarterly profit was 83 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected U.P.S. to post earnings of 85 cents a share.

To be fair, these were not ordinary engines, but muscular, large-scale versions that used to power the brown delivery trucks of the United Parcel Service, Mr. Planas’s employer. The recipient of the motors was no ordinary school either, but the Automotive High School, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which prepares its 1,023 students for careers in auto trades by giving them hands-on experience with machines of this type. Mr. Planas oversees the fleet of 800 U.P.S. vehicles that serve Manhattan and the Bronx, and the engines  a 4.9-liter Ford model, and one with 4.3 liters from General Motors  came from two of his older trucks. The Ford engine also came with its transmission. But by the beatific looks of the dozen juniors and seniors gathered in Room 138 during third period for the unveiling ceremony, one could be forgiven for thinking the actual gift was a library wing or a cafeteria. “I was shocked because I expected to drop off the engines and that would be it,” Mr. Planas said later. “I didn’t expect they would tear them apart right away.” Indeed, the students, who wore blue coveralls with racing stripes, descended on the silvery hulks like a time-conscious pit crew. “Get me a flathead, get me a flathead,” barked Garry Davis, 17, from Bedford-Stuyvesant, as he peered under the Ford engine’s intake manifold, deciding how best to take it off. But, surprisingly, a screwdriver was nowhere to be found. And even if one had been found, it might not have been effective. “Look at all that rust,” said John Mitchell, 19, from Flatbush, and his classmates huddled around for a glimpse. But after 10 minutes of twisting, and a pinch by pliers, the manifold came free, though Mr. Mitchell, putting his nose in close, was not pleased with its odor, and thus its cleanliness. “It stinks,” he said. Coordinated by Pencil, a 14-year-old nonprofit group that works to pair schools with business leaders, Wednesday’s event was the culmination of years of discussion between the United Parcel Service and Automotive, which relies on corporate partnerships to survive, said Melissa Silberman, the school’s principal. “We are only as good as our industry contacts, because unlike with art or music schools, cars are always changing, and our teachers need to be trained,” she said. The U.P.S. gift was a cut above previous donations (like, say, the one a few years back from Mercedes of two engines and a car) because it involved truck engines, which are generally tough to obtain, Ms. Silberman said. And the motors are light-years ahead of the types of machines Mr. Planas tinkered with in the late 1970s at Automotive, when any engines were likely to come from Brooklyn residents looking to dump their cars, he said. “So they were always a little bit behind the technology,” he said. A chance to work on any kind of real-life engine is a huge treat for Steven Almonte, 17, a senior from East New York, whose family does not own a car, and who came to Automotive with limited experience, consisting mostly of dismantling toy models, he said.

Quarterly Profit Falls 9.9 Percent<date>Published: October 23, 2008</date><text>United Parcel Service reported a 9.9 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday and said it expected consumers to cut back on holiday gift purchases. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio United Parcel Service Inc FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » The company is planning cost cuts, including layoffs, in 2009. It said it expected profit for 2008 to be toward the low end of a range it provided in July. “With consumer confidence approaching new lows, we’re concerned that Santa’s sleigh will be lighter this year,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Kuehn said that despite a slowing world economy, the company expected its global export package business to grow 5 percent in the current quarter. Demand for its services fell off sharply toward the end of the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, as the global financial crisis hit. “In September, we saw precipitous declines,” Mr. Kuehn said in the conference call. The results were better than Wall Street had forecast, and analysts attributed that to the decline in fuel prices of the last few months. U.P.S., like its rivals, has imposed surcharges to compensate for soaring diesel and jet fuel prices in recent years. U.P.S. shares rose 3.75 percent, or $1.74, to close at $48.13 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading. I.R.S. Reverses FedEx Ruling The Internal Revenue Service withdrew a preliminary finding that the FedEx Corporation owed back taxes for misclassifying drivers, bolstering the company’s assertion that the workers are contractors and not employees. The I.R.S. is continuing a tax audit of the FedEx Ground unit for the 2002 calendar year, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. The I.R.S. said in December that FedEx owed $319 million in back taxes and penalties for categorizing the ground drivers as contractors in 2002, and that similar issues were under audit for 2004 through 2006. The reversal may help FedEx defend itself in a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Indiana in which drivers are seeking $1 billion in damages. The drivers, who deliver packages through FedEx’s ground network, want to become employees, which would give them better pay and benefits and the ability to unionize. Lynn Rossman Faris, a lawyer who represents more than 20,000 current and former drivers suing FedEx, said it was unclear how the I.R.S. finding would affect the litigation. Fred Smith, FedEx’s founder and chief executive, says the ground drivers are small-business owners who invest in their trucks and are free to hire substitutes or helpers as they expand their routes.

DHL Express, the country’s third-biggest overnight deliverer, recently hired a rival, United Parcel Service, to handle its air cargo operations in the United States. Skip to next paragraph Jonathan Drake/Bloomberg News John P. Mullen Add to Portfolio United Parcel Service Inc Go to your Portfolio » While its global business is profitable, the American segment of DHL, acquired in 2002 by Deutsche Post of Germany, is expected to lose $1.3 billion this year. In an interview from DHL’s American headquarters in Plantation, Fla., its chief executive, John P. Mullen, discussed the deal with U.P.S. Q. What factors drove you to make a deal with U.P.S.? A. The cost of maintaining our network in the United States has been very painful to us, and it’s been exacerbated by the increasing fuel costs. Under the arrangement with U.P.S., if our volume should continue to fall, our costs fall with it. And we have 110 aircraft in the United States, a lot of which are quite old and will need replacement in the coming years. So we avoid that capital expenditure. Q. What kind of impact have fuel costs had? A. Very considerable. First, the straight cost burden, and our fuel surcharge does not cover all of it. But more importantly, it starts changing a customer’s behavior. When you say there’s a surcharge of 5 percent or 10 percent, they read the newspapers and they know fuel is going up. But when you start talking 30 percent and up, which is what we’ve got at the moment, the customer starts saying: “Well, do I really need the package there tomorrow morning at 10:30?” Q. Has that translated into less demand for air service? A. We’re seeing that customers are downgrading their service expectations, from air to ground. And once customers change, it’s pretty hard to get them to come back again. And even if fuel prices were to come down significantly, we’re not sure customers would revert to urgent air express. Our whole industry is going to have to adjust because, while it may not be tomorrow, we’re going to see huge amounts of our revenue migrate to ground and other forms of transport. Q. By outsourcing your air cargo services to a rival, where does that leave the company? What is the business model now  more ground and less air? A. Our business model hasn’t changed. We’re still picking up the package, we’re still delivering it. But instead of giving it to one operator who is flying just for us, we’re giving it to U.P.S., which, although it is a competitor, is just a service provider. The customers wouldn’t actually know whether we used U.P.S. or someone else for the air segment. Q. What was the price of this deal? A. U.P.S. will charge us about a billion dollars a year to move our material. Our savings, taking into account other restructuring, including closing 30 percent of our ground stations in the United States, will save us about a billion dollars a year. Q. How many jobs will you be cutting? A. We’re cutting 1,500 to 1,800 of our own employees, including some at our air hub in Wilmington, Ohio. And these changes will have an impact on our suppliers, which will mean several thousand more jobs will be affected. Our cuts will come in smaller towns, and we’ll close stations where there are several in the same area. Q. What percentage of your business will be affected by these changes? A. We’re estimating that these changes, while they sound fairly large, will only have an impact on about 4 percent of our shipments. In other words, 4 percent of our shipments will go from early morning delivery to maybe afternoon delivery. We’ll still be delivering them, but they will be slightly slower than before, but only a small percent. Q. How does this affect the general landscape in the United States for deliveries? A. It shouldn’t make any appreciable difference, and while the deal should make us both more productive, we remain full-tilt competitors. In the rest of the world, in Europe, Asia and emerging economies  where we are in a much stronger position  we are trying to make life as difficult as possible for them. Q. How much of a decline in daily package volume have you seen because of the economy slumping? A. Some customers are not sending altogether. But most are trying to find a cheaper way, such as sending it by ground. We’ve got the double impact right now of fuel costs and the economic recession because we carry an awful lot of mortgage documents, contracts and so on, and that side of our business is very significantly under pressure. Air express overnight volumes in the industry are down anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent from this time last year. Q. When will the new arrangement go into effect? A. We hope to have a completed agreement with U.P.S. in a couple of months, and we would start to migrate volume across. We would like to see it all in place by mid- to late 2009. But at the end of the year, our busiest season since stores and other parts of industry are ramping up, we will slacken off and try not to make too many changes until the new year.

U.P.S. said it expected earnings for 2008 in a range of $3.50 to $3.70 a share. Analysts have forecast $3.61 a share. U.P.S. said its outlook would translate to a second-half range of $1.78 to $1.98, compared with a first-half performance of $1.72. In a conference call, the company’s chief executive, D. Scott Davis, said U.P.S. was “making good progress” toward concluding a 10-year agreement with DHL, the Deutsche Post express unit, to haul packages by air for DHL within the United States and among the United States, Canada and Mexico. DHL and U.P.S. said in May they were working on a deal. At the time, U.P.S. said the deal could generate up to $1 billion in annual revenue. U.P.S. shares rose $2.65, or 4.5 percent, closing at $62.11, on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/business/worldbusiness/29dhl.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">DHL Talks With U.P.S. About Carrying U.S. Cargo<date>Published: May 29, 2008</date><text>PARIS  Seeking to end years of losses at its struggling express delivery business in the United States, Deutsche Post, the German mail and logistics group, said Wednesday that it would cut at least 1,500 jobs in North America and hire its rival, United Parcel Service, for air-cargo services. The overhaul at the unit, DHL, is expected to cost $2 billion, Deutsche Post said. Under the deal, the company will pay U.P.S. $1 billion a year for 10 years to carry shipments in North America. Deutsche Post, based in Bonn, said that it remained committed to serving United States customers, and that less than 4 percent of its shipments would be affected. It expects to save about $1 billion a year from the deal. Christian Obst, an analyst who covers Deutsche Post at Unicredit in Munich, said the prospect of continuing losses in the United States was “a little disappointing,” but that over all, “it seems like the right approach.” “Management is admitting that they cannot stand face to face against FedEx and U.P.S. on their home turf,” Mr. Obst said. “This is over now.” Deutsche Post built the DHL express delivery service in the United States by acquiring DHL in 2002 and Airborne Express in 2003. It ranks third in the North American overnight delivery business, behind U.P.S. and FedEx, but it has never made a profit. Its American hub of operations is in Wilmington, Ohio. The Deutsche Post chief executive, Frank Appel, said in an interview that the deal made economic sense. “They have empty capacity in their fleet, and we have empty capacity in our fleet,” he said. Mr. Appel said Deutsche Post’s American express delivery business would lose $1.3 billion this year, even as DHL’s global express business made a profit of about $650 million. By 2011, the American loss should be cut to about $300 million, he said, noting that the company was prepared to lose money in the United States indefinitely if necessary. He said there would be 1,500 to 1,800 job cuts at DHL, but he declined to disclose the number of jobs that would be lost at its subcontractors, on which DHL relies heavily. U.P.S. said the deal involved only the transport of packages, primarily between airports, in North America, not the pickup or delivery of DHL packages to DHL customers. The details of the agreement are still being negotiated, and it will require approval by competition authorities. But both companies expressed confidence that a deal would be completed this year.

In May 2003, when gasoline was $1.50 a gallon, FedEx was predicting that it would have 30,000 hybrids on the road in a few years. But today, all companies together have only about 300. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Hybrid Vehicles On paper, commercial vehicles, not private cars, should be the “killer app” for hybrid technology. Delivery trucks operate in stop-and-go traffic, where hybrids excel. Commercial vehicles drive many more hours a day than family cars do, going many more miles in a year and using more fuel for each mile, thus multiplying the opportunities for saving fuel. And with gasoline at about $3.50 a gallon, and diesel around $4, the shift to hybrids should go faster. FedEx said in 2003 that it was buying 20 hybrid delivery trucks, but David J. Bronczek, chief executive of the company’s FedEx Express unit, said at the time, “I can’t envision any reason why we wouldn’t roll this out over the whole fleet.” Today, the company has about 100 but says it hopes to have dozens more by the end of the year. U.P.S., which has been experimenting with alternative-fuel vehicles for decades, is using about 50 gasoline-electric hybrids and has tried two hydraulic hybrids, which store energy in the form of oil in a pressure tank instead of electricity in a battery. It plans to try eight more hydraulic hybrids, but is moving deliberately. “We need to justify them to all our stakeholders, our customers, our investors and our employees,” said Michael R. Hance, vice president for automotive engineering and operations. Production volumes are small, so there are few economies of scale, the manufacturers and customers say. So the price premium for a hybrid is still very large. “We need to get production up to several thousand a year to get the nice breaks in price structure,” said Kevin Beaty, manager of hybrid power systems at the Eaton Corporation, a major producer of hybrid delivery trucks and other medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The company declined to provide production figures. One result, he said, is that a delivery truck that costs $40,000 as an ordinary diesel will sell for $70,000 as a hybrid. There is progress, though: U.P.S. said its early hybrids cost double what an ordinary vehicle did, but the premium is now just 50 percent. In contrast, when Toyota introduced the Prius, it began with a production run in the thousands per year and is now in the hundreds of thousands. But for trucks, “we’re talking about an emerging technology,” said Dimitri Kazarinoff, a manager of new technologies at Eaton. And there is another reason: consumers may buy a Prius or other hybrid because it is cool to own one, but businesses sharpen their pencils better when it comes to calculating the payback time. For example, a 10,000-pound walk-in FedEx delivery truck called the W700 carries 6,000 pounds of packages. The company has dozens of these trucks that are hybrids. A consumer shopping for a car might be drawn by “the chicness of the Prius,” said Mitch Jackson, environmental director at the company. But when it comes to chic, “We never looked at the W700 in that light.” Mr. Jackson said the company planned to replace standard trucks with hybrids if it were economically feasible. But even with $3 gasoline, the payback period is 20 years, he said. Hybrids may be irresistible in some special cases, experts said. For example, Florida Power and Light is using what it calls a hybrid bucket truck. In a conventional bucket truck, the lineman keeps the truck’s gas or diesel engine running while parked on the job just to power the bucket. In the hybrid version, the power comes from batteries charged while the truck is moving. And the range of hybrids in commercial use may eventually be much wider than those in light-duty vehicles like cars and S.U.V.’s. Eaton, for example, is working on another innovation, a purely hydraulic hybrid, for use in garbage trucks. These would capture the energy that is ordinarily lost when the truck stops for a curbside pickup, and gives it back through a hydraulic pump in a “launch assist,” to get the truck moving to the next house. It has no batteries and no special electrical system. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: May 25, 2008 An article on April 27 about commercial applications for hybrid vehicles described a bucket truck used by Florida Power and Light incorrectly. While the truck’s hybrid system can indeed power the bucket, it can also power the drive wheels.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image David Zalubowski/Associated Press To avoid bankruptcy some chains are closing stores. Foot Locker said it would close 140 stores over the next year. Multimedia Since last fall, eight mostly midsize chains  as diverse as the furniture store Levitz and the electronics seller Sharper Image  have filed for bankruptcy protection as they staggered under mounting debt and declining sales. But the troubles are quickly spreading to bigger national companies, like Linens ‘n Things, the bedding and furniture retailer with 500 stores in 47 states. It may file for bankruptcy as early as this week, according to people briefed on the matter. Even retailers that can avoid bankruptcy are shutting down stores to preserve cash through what could be a long economic downturn. Over the next year, Foot Locker said it would close 140 stores, Ann Taylor will start to shutter 117, and the jeweler Zales will close 100. The surging cost of necessities has led to a national belt-tightening among consumers. Figures released on Monday showed that spending on food and gasoline is crowding out other purchases, leaving people with less to spend on furniture, clothing and electronics. Consequently, chains specializing in those goods are proving vulnerable. Retailing is a business with big ups and downs during the year, and retailers rely heavily on borrowed money to finance their purchases of merchandise and even to meet payrolls during slow periods. Yet the nation’s banks, struggling with the growing mortgage crisis, have started to balk at extending new loans, effectively cutting up the retail industry’s collective credit cards. “You have the makings of a wave of significant bankruptcies,” said Al Koch, who helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy in 2003 as the company’s interim chief financial officer and works at a corporate turnaround firm called AlixPartners. “For years, no deal was too ugly to finance,” he said. “But now, nobody will throw money at these companies.” Because retailers rely on a broad network of suppliers, their bankruptcies are rippling across the economy. The cash-short chains are leaving behind tens of millions of dollars in unpaid bills to shipping companies, furniture manufacturers, mall owners and advertising agencies. Many are unlikely to be paid in full, spreading the economic pain. When it filed for bankruptcy, Sharper Image owed $6.6 million to United Parcel Service. The furniture chain Levitz owed Sealy $1.4 million. And it is not just large companies that are absorbing the losses. When Domain, the furniture retailer, filed for bankruptcy, it owed On Time Express, a 90-employee transportation and logistics company in Tempe, Ariz., about $30,000. “We’ll be lucky to see pennies on the dollar, if we see anything,” said Ross Musil, the chief financial officer of On Time Express. “It’s a big loss.” Most of the ailing companies have filed for reorganization, not liquidation, under the bankruptcy laws, including the furniture chain Wickes, the housewares seller Fortunoff, Harvey Electronics and the catalog retailer Lillian Vernon. But, in a contrast with previous recessions, many are unlikely to emerge from bankruptcy, lawyers and industry experts said. Changes in the federal bankruptcy code in 2005 significantly tightened deadlines for ailing companies to restructure their businesses, offering them less leeway. And the changes may force companies to pay suppliers before paying wages or honoring obligations to customers, like redeeming gift cards, said Sally Henry, a partner in the bankruptcy law practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom and the author of several books on bankruptcy. As a result, she said, “it’s no longer reorganization or even liquidation for these companies. In many cases, it’s evaporation.” Several of the retailers that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over the last eight months, like the furniture sellers Bombay, Levitz and Domain, have begun to wind down  closing stores, laying off workers and liquidating merchandise. In most cases, the collapses stemmed from a combination of factors: flawed business strategies, a souring economy and banks’ unwillingness to issue cheap loans. Bombay, a chain with 360 stores, was considered a success in the furniture world, after its sales surged from $393 million in 1999 to $596 million in 2003. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »The consumer spending slump and tightening credit markets are unleashing a widening wave of bankruptcies in American retailing, prompting thousands of store closings that are expected to remake suburban malls and downtown shopping districts across the country.

Technology names were among the steepest decliners, and the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index fell more than 1 percent. A surge in oil prices weighed on transportation stocks and contributed to a pessimistic tone in the market. The rise hurt shares of airline and trucking companies, which have already struggled with high fuel costs. U.P.S., the world’s largest shipping carrier, pointed to a weaker economy and higher fuel costs in trimming its forecast. Reports this week from the aluminum producer Alcoa and the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices have made the market uneasy about first-quarter results. Still, Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for the brokerage service Thinkorswim Group, said that the relative calm seen in the markets in recent sessions was impressive. “It’s the first week we have had in a while where stocks are trading on their own merit. That’s why we’re trading on oil,” he said. “It’s amazing how well the market has held in there with three days of not good news.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.18, or 0.39 percent, to 12,527.26. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index fell 11.05, or 0.81 percent, to 1,354.49, and the Nasdaq declined 26.64, or 1.13 percent, to 2,322.12. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.54, or 1.90 percent, to 698.38. Bond prices jumped as stocks declined. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 20/32, to 100 5/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.48 percent from 3.56 percent. Light crude jumped $2.37 to settle at $110.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising as high as $112.21. The rise in oil hurt transportation stocks. Among airlines, Continental Airlines fell $1.66, or 7.6 percent, to $20.24, while the trucking company J. B. Hunt Transport Service fell $1.92, or 6 percent, to $29.85. Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball &amp; Associates in Bethlehem, Pa., said some investors worried that profit warnings from companies like U.P.S. could signal the economy was facing a tougher climb, derailing hopes for a recovery in the second half of the year. “We know the first quarter is not going to be good,” he said, adding: “People are looking for clues more, I think, for the second half this year.” Mr. Kinahan said that the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s volatility index, known as the VIX and often referred to as the “fear index,” rose to 22.83 on Wednesday, but remained below the important 25 level. Readings in this range, he said, suggest investors are being careful but are not succumbing to fear. U.P.S. warned at an investor conference last month that it might miss its earnings target if weakness seen in February did not ease. U.P.S. fell $2.74, or 3.7 percent, to $70.57. AMR Corporation fell $1.15, or 11 percent, to $9.17 after its American Airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights as it inspects the wiring on some of its aircraft.

The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index fell 11.05, or 0.81 percent, to 1,354.49, and the Nasdaq declined 26.64, or 1.13 percent, to 2,322.12. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.54, or 1.90 percent, to 698.38. Bond prices jumped as stocks declined. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 20/32, to 100 5/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.48 percent from 3.56 percent. Light crude jumped $2.37 to settle at $110.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising as high as $112.21. The rise in oil hurt transportation stocks. Among airlines, Continental Airlines fell $1.66, or 7.6 percent, to $20.24, while the trucking company J. B. Hunt Transport Service fell $1.92, or 6 percent, to $29.85. Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball &amp; Associates in Bethlehem, Pa., said some investors worried that profit warnings from companies like U.P.S. could signal the economy was facing a tougher climb, derailing hopes for a recovery in the second half of the year. “We know the first quarter is not going to be good,” he said, adding: “People are looking for clues more, I think, for the second half this year.” Mr. Kinahan said that the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s volatility index, known as the VIX and often referred to as the “fear index,” rose to 22.83 on Wednesday, but remained below the important 25 level. Readings in this range, he said, suggest investors are being careful but are not succumbing to fear. U.P.S. warned at an investor conference last month that it might miss its earnings target if weakness seen in February did not ease. U.P.S. fell $2.74, or 3.7 percent, to $70.57. AMR Corporation fell $1.15, or 11 percent, to $9.17 after its American Airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights as it inspects the wiring on some of its aircraft. On Tuesday, American canceled 460 flights after federal inspectors found problems in work done two weeks ago on wiring. Boeing delayed its 787 jetliner by an additional six months, but some analysts had expected a greater delay. The stock, one of the 30 that comprise the Dow industrials, rose $3.58, or 4.8 percent, to $78.60 and helped contain the blue chips’ losses.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/business/31parcel.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">United Parcel Service Swings to a Loss<date>Published: January 31, 2008</date><text>United Parcel Service Inc., the package delivery company, reported a quarterly loss on Wednesday because of a $6.1 billion pension-related charge.

Not a ton of gas and money if we're talking about just you and your Windstar, say, but immensely wasteful if we're talking about more than 95,000 big square brown trucks delivering packages every day. And this realization -- that when you operate a gigantic fleet of vehicles, tiny improvements in the efficiency of each one will translate to huge savings overall -- is what led U.P.S. to limit further the number of left-hand turns its drivers make. The company employs what it calls a ''package flow'' software program, which among other hyperefficient practices involving the packing and sorting of its cargo, maps out routes for every one of its drivers, drastically reducing the number of left-hand turns they make (taking into consideration, of course, those instances where not to make the left-hand turn would result in a ridiculously circuitous route). Last year, according to Heather Robinson, a U.P.S. spokeswoman, the software helped the company shave 28.5 million miles off its delivery routes, which has resulted in savings of roughly three million gallons of gas and has reduced CO2 emissions by 31,000 metric tons. So what can Brown do for you? We can't speak to how good or bad they are in the parcel-delivery world, but they won't be clogging up the left-hand lane while they do their business. JOEL LOVELL LIGHTNING FARMS [29] The possibility of harnessing the spectacular power of lightning has captured the imagination for a long time -- or at least since Doc Brown returned Marty McFly to 1985 at the moment that lightning struck Hill Valley's clock tower in ''Back to the Future.'' This summer, a company named Alternate Energy Holdings set out to see if the energy in lightning could actually be harvested, and if so, whether full-scale lightning farms might one day become a meaningful source of electricity. The company purchased a design plan from Steve LeRoy, an Illinois inventor who reportedly powered a 60-watt bulb for 20 minutes with a small, artificially generated lightning flash. Then they went about trying to develop a real-life system in the Houston area, where electrical storms are frequent. In the simplest terms, LeRoy's concept involved a tower, an array of grounding wires to shunt off most of the incoming energy and a giant capacitor. Theoretically, if enough energy is delivered to the capacitor, it can be stored, converted to alternating current and transferred to the power grid. The team believed it could attract strikes and collect ambient electrical energy from storms. But according to Donald Gillispie, C.E.O. of Alternate Energy Holdings, ''Quite frankly, we just couldn't make it work.'' And so for now they're out of the lightning-farm business and concentrating on other projects (including a proposed nuclear power plant/biofuel facility in Idaho). ''Given enough time and money, you could probably scale this thing up,'' he says. ''It's not black magic; it's truly math and science, and it could happen.'' Dr. Martin A. Uman, co-director of the Lightning Research Laboratory at the University of Florida, disagrees. ''Lightning is just really fast and really bright,'' he says, but doesn't actually carry that much energy by the time it gets down to earth. He estimates that dozens of towers would be required just to operate five 100-watt light bulbs for a year. ''The energy is in the thunderstorm,'' he says. ''A typical little thunderstorm is like an atomic bomb's worth of energy. But trying to get the energy from the bottom of the lightning is hopeless.'' JOHN GLASSIE LITE-BRITE FASHION The term Lite-Brite fashion may call to mind cheap novelty gimmicks like the flashing T-shirts favored by club kids, not the handiwork of a respected high-end designer. But this year, Hussein Chalayan, the nutty professor of fashion, produced a handful of effulgent dresses and hats that were illuminating in more than the obvious, brighten-dark-corners sort of way. Using lasers and light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s -- the sort found in mobile phones -- Chalayan played with the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of light and once again upturned conventional notions about clothing and its material (in every sense of the word) limitations.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E6D9103BF933A05753C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING | ASIA; China: Staples and U.P.S.

Earnings Beat Expectations<date>Published: October 24, 2007</date><text>United Parcel Service posted a better-than-expected profit yesterday, citing growth in its global business, supply chain and freight unit, as well as modest growth in its United States package business despite a sluggish economy. Although U.P.S.s results should continue to be driven by its international business and gains at the supply chain and freight unit, the chief financial officer, D. Scott Davis, warned in a statement that slowing retail sales will restrain U.S. domestic volume growth. Mr. Davis is scheduled to become the companys chief executive in January. But in an interview with Reuters, Mr. Davis said he expected United States economic growth to be a little better in 2008 than in 2007. Like its main rival, FedEx, U.P.S. is seen as a bellwether of United States economic health, based on the premise that package volumes rise in a more vibrant economy and fall when growth slows. U.P.S., the worlds largest package-delivery company, reported third-quarter net income of $1.08 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a $46 million restructuring charge and related expenses for a supply-chain business in France, earnings per share for the quarter amounted to $1.05. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, based in Atlanta, reported third-quarter revenue of $12.21 billion, up from $11.66 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $12.24 billion. The story at U.P.S. is steady as she goes, despite some choppy waters in the freight market, said Keith Schoonmaker, an analyst at Morningstar. Revenue at U.P.S.s domestic package business rose 2 percent to $7.55 billion. U.P.S.s international package business increased 12 percent, to $2.53 billion, and sales at the companys supply chain and freight unit rose 6 percent, to $2.13 billion. I am impressed at how U.P.S. has turned supply chain and freight into a profitable operation despite a depressed less-than-truckload market, Mr. Schoonmaker said. U.P.S. Freight is a less-than-truckload operator. Like the rest of the United States trucking market, less-than-truckload companies, which consolidate smaller loads into a single truck, have had weak freight volumes since the third quarter of 2006. Mr. Davis, the chief financial officer, said U.P.S. Freights growth had come from taking less-than-truckload market share, which he said should continue for the next several years. U.P.S. expects full-year earnings per share of $4.13 to $4.19. Analysts had predicted full-year earnings per share of $4.15. U.P.S. shares were up 0.7 percent, or 55 cents, to $75.64.

Union and company officials hailed the agreement, saying it would help protect the pensions of the 44,000 active U.P.S. employees in the plan. Because of underfunding, the trustees in that multiemployer plan have reduced pension payments to retirees since 2003. The two sides sought to negotiate a deal before Jan. 1, when the federal government is to begin enforcing new pension rules with regard to multiemployer plans, a move that might mean further cuts in pension payouts under the plan. The Teamsters contract with United Parcel Service is due to expire next July 31, but in an unusual move, the two sides rushed to negotiate a deal by Oct. 1 to give the members time to ratify it well before Jan. 1.

Unhappy with the high annual expenses of paying into the Central States plan, U.P.S. obtained the blessing of the union and the pension trustees to withdraw, but to do so it must first pay $6.1 billion to shore up the plan. Actuaries estimate that the plan is underfunded by 49 percent, and with the $6.1 billion contribution, will remain 30 percent underfunded. As part of the agreement, the company and the union will set up a new jointly administered plan for the 44,000 U.P.S. workers in the plan. Union officials said the U.P.S. move would ultimately result in larger pensions for those 44,000 employees. By withdrawing from the plan, U.P.S. expects to save money. It paid $1.4 billion into its 21 Teamster pension plans last year. This agreement will allow us to remain competitive in a challenging marketplace, said Mike Eskew, the chairman of United Parcel Service. About 380,000 current workers and retirees from U.P.S. and other companies belong to the Central States plan. U.P.S. belongs to 20 additional multiemployer plans. The Central States plan was restored to health under a trusteeship in the 1980s after mob corruption helped deplete the fund in the 1960s and 1970s. But assets sank in 2003 because its Wall Street advisers had invested poorly in volatile stocks. Ken Hall, director of the Teamsters U.P.S. division, hailed yesterdays agreement, saying it would provide a total of $9 an hour in wage and benefit increases per worker on average over the life of the five-year accord. Mr. Hall declined to say what the percentage wage increases would be. He said U.P.S. drivers earn $28 an hour, which, with overtime, generally amounts to $75,000 a year. With health benefits, pension benefits and other benefits included, he said, their compensation totals $40 an hour. Its a great deal, Mr. Hall said. Our members wanted us to put more money into benefits instead of wages, and weve accomplished that. When the Teamsters went on strike against U.P.S. for 15 days in 1997, one issue was the companys demand to be able to withdraw from the Central States plan. The two companies reached a separate contract for 125 workers at the Indianapolis terminal in the U.P.S. freight division, which was formerly the Overnite Transportation Company. It is the first contract the Teamsters have had with the division.

Large numbers of Canadians cross the border in search of lower prices and greater selection at American stores. But when the Canadian dollar reached parity with American currency last week, there was a new twist: online sales now let Canadians bargain-hunt in the United States without leaving home. If early indications hold true, some of the biggest gains from the Canadian dollars strength  it settled in New York late Thursday at 99.87 cents  may be at online retailers based in the United States. Because Canadas small population compared with the United States, some 33 million versus 302 million, makes online operations less cost-effective, relatively few Canadian retailers, less than a third by some estimates, sell on the Web. That limited local competition, combined with the strong Canadian dollar and the moderate cost of expanding into Canada, make the country a tempting target for American electronic retailers. No one measures Canadian crossborder spending, virtual or otherwise, but Paulina Sazon, a direct-marketing strategist at Canada Post, said the volume of shipments through the Canadian postal services special service for American retailers increased 38 percent over the last year. A spokeswoman at UPS Canada, Christina Falcone, said her company had also registered "significant growth" as a result of the strengthened Canadian dollar. Representatives of retailers tell the same story, including those from L. L. Bean, Crate &amp; Barrel and Brookstone: all posted noticeable increases in sales to Canada in the last few months. Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman for L. L. Bean, said double-digit growth had prompted the company to increase marketing efforts aimed at Canada and to begin advertising in this country. "We like our Canadian neighbors, and they seem to like us," Ms. Beem said. Several retailers, including Amazon.com, declined to discuss their Canadian trade, while others, like Lands End, did not respond to requests for comment. In some cases, American retailers could not say how much of their increase in Canadian sales was attributable to the weak American dollar and how much resulted from increased marketing efforts. Ms. Sazon of Canada Post said that research conducted by her office in conjunction with a retailing research firm, NPD Canada, showed strong interest among Canadian shoppers for buying online from the United States  but not from just any American retailer. According to the study, Canadians are most interested in buying clothing online from Target. But Target does not ship to Canadian customers and has no Canadian stores. Target did not respond to a request for comment on the policy. The Gap also denies Canadians special access to online shopping, but the company does operate stores in Canada. Other American retailers who court Canadian customers through the Web, including Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, have set up separate online operations in Canada. Since shoppers on those Canada-based Web sites are not making crossborder purchases, they do not benefit directly from the weaker dollar. But they do benefit from falling prices on many American products. Although Canada and the United States share a free-trade agreement, crossborder trade is hardly free. All merchandise entering Canada is inspected by Canadian Border Services, which adds federal sales taxes, provincial sales tax (except in Alberta) and, in the case of some products made in third countries, duty. In addition, the companies transporting the packages have border handling fees of their own, which on a $300 item can exceed 40 Canadian dollars. Canada Post adds a flat fee of 5 Canadian dollars. To avoid those charges, L. L. Bean and several other companies use a Canada Post service that brings their parcels across the border in bulk rather than individually. The American retailer collects Canadian taxes at the time of the purchase and the customer is not surprised by border fees at the doorstep. The service also enables a shopper to return items to a Canadian address. U.P.S. operates warehouses in Canada that hold inventory from American online retailers, including Crown Premiums, a collectible model-car maker in Bonita Springs, Fla. Orders placed on Web sites in the United States are filled with merchandise from the Canadian warehouses. The J. C. Williams Group, Canadas leading retail consultancy, estimates that American companies account for about a third of all Canadian online shopping. Canada Post said that reached about 60 percent at the height of the shopping season last year. Jim Okamura, a senior partner in J. C. Williams, said that growing business in Canada might allow retailers to offset an increasingly saturated market. And Canada could perform another role for American retailers. For many companies, Mr. Okamura said, Canada is really being seen as the first step in a broad international expansion plan. More Articles in Business »OTTAWA, Sept. 27  The ritual has resumed, as it always does when the Canadian dollar rises against the United States dollar. Large numbers of Canadians cross the border in search of lower prices and greater selection at American stores. But when the Canadian dollar reached parity with American currency last week, there was a new twist: online sales now let Canadians bargain-hunt in the United States without leaving home. If early indications hold true, some of the biggest gains from the Canadian dollars strength  it settled in New York late Thursday at 99.87 cents  may be at online retailers based in the United States. Because Canadas small population compared with the United States, some 33 million versus 302 million, makes online operations less cost-effective, relatively few Canadian retailers, less than a third by some estimates, sell on the Web. That limited local competition, combined with the strong Canadian dollar and the moderate cost of expanding into Canada, make the country a tempting target for American electronic retailers. No one measures Canadian crossborder spending, virtual or otherwise, but Paulina Sazon, a direct-marketing strategist at Canada Post, said the volume of shipments through the Canadian postal services special service for American retailers increased 38 percent over the last year. A spokeswoman at UPS Canada, Christina Falcone, said her company had also registered "significant growth" as a result of the strengthened Canadian dollar. Representatives of retailers tell the same story, including those from L. L. Bean, Crate &amp; Barrel and Brookstone: all posted noticeable increases in sales to Canada in the last few months. Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman for L. L. Bean, said double-digit growth had prompted the company to increase marketing efforts aimed at Canada and to begin advertising in this country. "We like our Canadian neighbors, and they seem to like us," Ms. Beem said. Several retailers, including Amazon.com, declined to discuss their Canadian trade, while others, like Lands End, did not respond to requests for comment. In some cases, American retailers could not say how much of their increase in Canadian sales was attributable to the weak American dollar and how much resulted from increased marketing efforts. Ms. Sazon of Canada Post said that research conducted by her office in conjunction with a retailing research firm, NPD Canada, showed strong interest among Canadian shoppers for buying online from the United States  but not from just any American retailer. According to the study, Canadians are most interested in buying clothing online from Target. But Target does not ship to Canadian customers and has no Canadian stores.

But in a crowded system plagued by delays, that may be enough to help smooth out bottlenecks. The carriers use of satellite navigation and other tools and techniques represents a step toward replacing a 50-year-old system of radar and radio beacons. In the process, they are pulling along a slow-moving government agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, that is eager for better air traffic control systems but short on money and the authority to put changes in place. It is a revolution in technology, but also in politics. Previously, the F.A.A. usually bought new systems on the ground and told airlines to equip themselves to use them; now the airlines are taking the initiative to outfit their planes, with safety regulation from the F.A.A. Airlines are even developing their own approach patterns for airports, which has almost always been a government job. U.P.S. Airlines, working with Aviation Communications and Surveillance Systems, based in Phoenix, is developing a landing pattern based on separating planes by time, not distance, so they land at the briefest safe interval. Were going to create the future, because we think we know where its going to go, said Karen Lee, director of operations at U.P.S. This is in contrast to the traditional way of doing business, typified by the F.A.A. tells us what the roadmap is, she said, then well start building the stuff to do it. This is not quite do-it-yourself air traffic control, because everything requires F.A.A. analysis and approval. But the agency is encouraging airlines to innovate, and is getting itself out of the picture, in many ways. For example, last Thursday it awarded a contract to a team led by the ITT Corporation, worth $207 million initially and possibly up to $1.8 billion, to build and operate a national network of radio receivers to accept signals from airplanes in flight. Each plane would give its position as determined by G.P.S. The ITT contract is part of a system that would process that data to allow controllers and pilots in flight to see a display showing where all the planes are. Another big step for the agency, which it hopes to take this year, is to publish a proposed rule giving the schedule for when airplanes will have to be equipped for satellite navigation and surveillance. No one knows how much this will cut delays and improve capacity. But there are glimpses. One is in Juneau, Alaska. For years, airplanes could not safely find the runway there, nestled between mountains, unless clouds were at least 1,000 feet above the ground and visibility was more than two miles. And if there were clouds, there was only one way out, to the west, with a quick U-turn, which could be frustrating for travelers. To assure that the plane could accomplish that maneuver under worst-case conditions  an engine failure on takeoff  Alaska Airlines often had to leave passengers or freight behind at the airport. Today, Alaska Airlines planes land there as long as clouds are 337 feet above the surface and in visibility down to one mile. And they can take off in either direction. Of the approximately 3,600 flights the airline operated in and out of Juneau last year, 754 could not have been tried in years past. Its a thing of beauty, said Kevin Finan, acting vice president for flight operations at Alaska Airlines. The more reliable operations happened because of a system developed largely by the airline. Through a combination of G.P.S., traditional navigation aids and instruments on board that give the planes position by measuring each turn, Alaska Airlines Boeing 737s know their position within 600 feet, the airline equivalent of the head of a pin. In contrast, the older system required pilots to draw a mental map of the planes position, using compass cards and a display of how far the plane was from some land-based radio beacon, and a paper chart showing the mountains in the area. Now the planes have a map that shows the mountains, the weather and the planes position. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »WASHINGTON, Sept. 4  At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Delta Air Lines said its jets take off an average of 10 minutes after pushing back from the gate  three minutes faster than in previous years.

Jon S. Corzine wrote a letter urging it to comply with the state’s five-month-old civil union law. The policy decision was a reversal for the company, which had said it could not offer such benefits because the couples were not legally married, and will affect an unspecified number of United Parcel’s 8,700 employees who belong to the Teamsters union. Two couples, through a lawyer, formally appealed to the company in recent months to give them benefits. One of the employees, Tom Walton, received a letter yesterday from the claims review committee, telling him that his and his partner’s request had been approved. “We were very, very excited,” said Mr. Walton, a driver who has worked at U.P.S. for 14 years. His partner, Mearmon Davis, a hospital security supervisor, had wanted to share Mr. Walton’s health benefits, which include dental and vision coverage. Mr. Walton added: “U.P.S. is a good company, a very diverse company. When we thought we weren’t going to get benefits, we were very disappointed.” Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality, a gay-rights organization, said that more than 200 same-sex couples had complained that their employers had not recognized the civil union law, enacted after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last fall that all couples must be treated equally. The court left it to the Legislature whether to achieve that through same-sex marriage or civil unions. In February, lawmakers made New Jersey the nation’s third state, behind Vermont and Connecticut, to recognize civil unions. Massachusetts is the only state where gay marriage is legal. David S. Buckel, who represented Mr. Walton and another U.P.S. driver, Nickie Brazier, said that he had been working with more than a hundred couples “who are struggling to get respect for their civil union laws.” Many of the companies have granted benefits after he negotiated with them, but other cases are still pending. “It’s a long hard slog through company after company,” he said. “The Legislature could stop it with the stroke of a pen.” Norman Black, a spokesman for the shipping company, said the change in his company’s policy came about after conversations with state officials. “In the course of those discussions, at least in the case of New Jersey, it became clear that the state is treating civil union partners as if they are married partners,” he said. Teamsters who work for United Parcel Service in Massachusetts are already eligible for health benefits, but the company is currently reviewing the law in Vermont and Connecticut, Mr. Black said. In all, the company employs about 238,000 Teamsters nationwide, and whether the same-sex couples among them will be extended the same health benefits as their colleagues in New Jersey depends on a round of collective bargaining currently under way, Mr. Black said. The company already offers these benefits to management and administrative employees in New Jersey. Lilo Stainton, a spokeswoman for Governor Corzine, said that an official from United Parcel Service delivered the news yesterday to the governor’s office in person. “The governor is extremely pleased with the news, not just for what it means for these couples, but also for the larger implication and the greater meaning of New Jersey’s civil union law,” she said. The company, she said, “got the big picture.” She added that Mr. Corzine “hopes that other companies will follow this excellent example.” Mr. Walton said he and his partner received the news of the health benefits on the same day that they applied for a home equity loan. “They asked if we were married,” he said. “We said, well we’re civil union partners. But there was no box to check. There was single, married, and divorced.” “The woman looked at us like she had never heard of such a thing,” he added. “The fact is, we have to explain ourselves.” More Articles in New York Region »United Parcel Service said yesterday that it would offer health benefits to its employees’ partners in civil unions in New Jersey, 10 days after Gov.

Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey sent a letter on Friday urging United Parcel Service to provide the same benefits for civil union partners as it does for married couples, intervening for the first time in the question of whether companies are appropriately following the states mandate for equal treatment of same-sex couples. The letter stemmed from complaints made by a truck driver for the company who has been unable to get health benefits for her partner after they became one of the first New Jersey couples to obtain a civil union. In February, the state became the third in the nation to authorize civil unions. The provision of employee benefits to civil union partners on the same terms as spouses would be more than a symbolic gesture of your companys commitment to eliminating discrimination, the governor wrote. Spousal benefits are a key element of the financial and physical well-being of working couples and their children. Company officials said on Friday that they had not received Mr. Corzines letter, and that the question of providing benefits to the driver, Nickie Brazier, is tied up in the legal complexities of a continuing contract negotiation with her union. But beyond the specific situation at the company, the governors letter hinted at the possibility of a broader battle that advocates for same-sex couples have warned about since a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling last fall saying that all couples must be treated equally, but leaving to the Legislature whether to achieve that through same-sex marriage or civil unions. Without marriage, the advocates say, many companies  either willfully, or because of the resulting legal confusion over how to define spouse  will not treat same-sex couples equally. Andrew Koppelman, a law professor at Northwestern University and author of the book Same Sex, Different States: When Same-Sex Marriages Cross State Lines, cited two pressing issues as states wrestle with the evolving definitions of couples: tangible benefits and symbolic approval. If you read the New Jersey statute, it gives couples all the same rights and responsibilities and benefits as heterosexual couples, Mr. Koppelman said. The objection that gay couples have is that civil unions are different, and by implication, inferior to heterosexual unions. Steven Goldstein, chairman of Garden State Equality, a statewide gay-rights organization, said that to date, 193 of the 1,359 couples who have registered for civil unions in New Jersey have reported to him that their companies are not recognizing their unions, though none have yet filed suit to challenge the law. Companies are offering a gazillion excuses, Mr. Goldstein said. The law says civil union partners should be treated as spouses, he said. It doesnt say they are spouses. Some companies, particularly those that are self-insured  like 51 percent of New Jersey businesses  contend that federal law creates obstacles to providing equal benefits. Some cite the federal Defense of Marriage Act, while many others, including United Parcel Service, refer to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The act, known as Erisa, pre-empts state laws and allows self-insured employers to choose how to define spouse. Erisa doesnt say that companies have to discriminate, said David S. Buckel, a senior attorney at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, who is representing Ms. Brazier. Their argument is that Erisa gives them a choice. The question is, will they make the right choice? A spokesman for United Parcel Service, Norman Black, said the company had a policy of extending domestic partner benefits to all of its employees, but had been advised by its lawyers that it could not give such benefits to employees represented by the Teamsters union under a contract that does not expire until next summer. In May, the company wrote to Ms. Brazier, saying that the company could not provide her partner, Heather Aurand, with health benefits because the state of New Jersey does not currently recognize same-sex marriages. Ms. Braziers health plan, the company said, provides benefits to her legal spouse as defined by state law. In summary, you cannot add Ms. Aurand as a spouse because New Jersey law does not treat civil unions the same as marriages, the letter concluded. Mr. Buckel, of Lambda Legal, said when he read the letter from the company, I fell off my chair. For advocacy organizations, there was no better evidence of the limitations of the civil union law than the companys letter. But in his response to United Parcel Service, Governor Corzine disagreed, arguing that New Jerseys law in no way prevents the company from providing benefits. New Jersey law intends that civil union partners be viewed as partners under all facets of New Jersey law and that a reference to spouse in a legal context, including in a contract, embraces civil union partners, he said.

The objection that gay couples have is that civil unions are different, and by implication, inferior to heterosexual unions. Steven Goldstein, chairman of Garden State Equality, a statewide gay-rights organization, said that to date, 193 of the 1,359 couples who have registered for civil unions in New Jersey have reported to him that their companies are not recognizing their unions, though none have yet filed suit to challenge the law. Companies are offering a gazillion excuses, Mr. Goldstein said. The law says civil union partners should be treated as spouses, he said. It doesnt say they are spouses. Some companies, particularly those that are self-insured  like 51 percent of New Jersey businesses  contend that federal law creates obstacles to providing equal benefits. Some cite the federal Defense of Marriage Act, while many others, including United Parcel Service, refer to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The act, known as Erisa, pre-empts state laws and allows self-insured employers to choose how to define spouse. Erisa doesnt say that companies have to discriminate, said David S. Buckel, a senior attorney at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, who is representing Ms. Brazier. Their argument is that Erisa gives them a choice. The question is, will they make the right choice? A spokesman for United Parcel Service, Norman Black, said the company had a policy of extending domestic partner benefits to all of its employees, but had been advised by its lawyers that it could not give such benefits to employees represented by the Teamsters union under a contract that does not expire until next summer. In May, the company wrote to Ms. Brazier, saying that the company could not provide her partner, Heather Aurand, with health benefits because the state of New Jersey does not currently recognize same-sex marriages. Ms. Braziers health plan, the company said, provides benefits to her legal spouse as defined by state law. In summary, you cannot add Ms. Aurand as a spouse because New Jersey law does not treat civil unions the same as marriages, the letter concluded. Mr. Buckel, of Lambda Legal, said when he read the letter from the company, I fell off my chair. For advocacy organizations, there was no better evidence of the limitations of the civil union law than the companys letter. But in his response to United Parcel Service, Governor Corzine disagreed, arguing that New Jerseys law in no way prevents the company from providing benefits. New Jersey law intends that civil union partners be viewed as partners under all facets of New Jersey law and that a reference to spouse in a legal context, including in a contract, embraces civil union partners, he said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD81E3EF930A25754C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Corrections: For the Record<date>Published: July 13, 2007</date><text>An article in Business Day yesterday about technology advancements by United Parcel Service misspelled the surname of a Merrill Lynch analyst who commented on the company's likely return on its investment in its high tech changes.

But increasingly, it is the researchers at its Atlanta headquarters, its technology center in Mahwah, N.J., and its huge four-million-square-foot Louisville hub who are asking the questions that will drive the companys future. What if the package contains medicine that could turn from palliative to poison if the temperature wavers? What if it is moving from Bangkok to Bangor and back to Bangkok, and if customs rules differ on each end? And what if the package is going to a big company that insists on receiving all its packages, no matter who ships them, at the same time each day? Increasingly, it is the search for high-tech answers to such questions that is occupying the entire package delivery industry. U.P.S. and FedEx are each pumping more than $1 billion a year into research, while also looking for new ways to cut costs. When you handle millions of packages, a minutes delay can cost a fortune, said John Kartsonas, an analyst with Citigroup. Information technology has become essential. Customers of both FedEx and U.P.S. can now print out shipping labels that are easily scannable by computers. Meteorologists at both companies routinely outguess official Weather Service forecasts. And both are working with the Federal Aviation Administration to improve air safety and scheduling. U.P.S. specifically is collaborating with the F.A.A. on a system  formally, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, but usually just called A.D.S.B.  that may make conventional radar obsolete. We want to make A.D.S.B. the backbone of our future air traffic system, said Vincent Capezzuto, the manager of the program for the F.A.A. The research at U.P.S. is paying off. Last year, it cut 28 million miles from truck routes  saving roughly three million gallons of fuel  in good part by mapping routes that minimize left turns. This year, U.P.S. began offering customers a self-service system for redirecting packages that are en route. And now the U.P.S. researchers are working on sensors that can track temperatures of packages, on software that can make customs checks more uniform worldwide and on scheduling processes that accommodate the needs of recipients as well as shippers. Recipients do not pay U.P.S., but they sure influence which carriers their suppliers use, David A. Barnes, the chief information officer, said. U.P.S. has the most at stake in the technological race. It handles an average of 15.7 million packages a day, more than twice the volume of FedEx. Unlike FedEx, U.P.S. has a huge unionized work force whose salaries and benefits soak up more than half of operating revenues, so it has the most to gain from automation. U.P.S. spent more than $600 million on package flow technology, and theyll recoup it and more over the next few years, said Ken Hoexter, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Every tidbit of package information, from size to destination to special handling needs, is embedded in those customer-generated scannable labels. That alone has enabled U.P.S. to offer premium-price early delivery in many more ZIP codes. And it has reduced the chaos that human error once caused drivers. Even the most seasoned loaders messed up sometimes, jumbling the packages, forgetting to list stops or setting up a schedule that made drivers retrace their steps. And when your regular loader was on vacation, you were really in trouble, recalled Mark Casey, a U.P.S. driver. Now the computer tells loaders what goes where. A hand-held device does the same for Mr. Casey. It also flags special requirements, like the need for an adults signature. It warns him if he must deviate from the route to make a timely delivery, or to accommodate a change in a packages destination. Mr. Casey said the system lets him drive fewer miles, yet make more stops. For U.P.S., it offers another bonus. It is much easier to train loaders, because the job has been deskilled, said Roger Hicks, a business manager at the package center. Conversely, though, jobs have grown more complicated at the Global Operations Center, the focal point for the airline side of U.P.S.s business. People there now schedule some 600 owned and chartered planes and crews around the globe each day. They also set up 11 spares, which can pick up packages trucked in from a fogbound airport, or pinch hit for a plane with mechanical problems. There arent many nights when we dont launch at least one, said Scott E. Warner, contingency shift manager for U.P.S. Airlines. The necessary coordination is formidable. To help make that work, all U.P.S. planes have transponders, of course, that signal their location, but 107 of them have A.D.S.B receivers. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: July 13, 2007 An article in Business Day yesterday about technology advancements by United Parcel Service misspelled the surname of a Merrill Lynch analyst who commented on the company’s likely return on its investment in its high tech changes.

The cancellation by U.P.S., four months after its main competitor, FedEx, also abandoned an order for 10 planes, leaves Airbus without a customer for the A380 freighter. It is another blow to the company, which announced this week the details of a cost-cutting plan that is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs across Europe over the next four years. This is another slap in the face for Airbus, said Doug McVitie, a consultant at Arran Aerospace in Dinan, France. U.P.S. will probably turn to Boeing now for good. The move follows a confirmation by Airbus late Monday that it had halted work on the A380 freighter to concentrate on the passenger version of the plane, now two years behind schedule. This is a decision; its final, said Mark Giuffre, a spokesman for U.P.S. in Louisville, Ky. U.P.S. said its decision would be formally presented to Airbus at the first opportunity allowed under the terms of an agreement reached last week that gave either party the right to cancel the order. The date has not been disclosed, but John Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer for customers, said last week that the date fell in the second half of this year.

Those planes are scheduled to be delivered between 2009 and 2012. U.P.S. said at the time that the Boeing order was not related to its review of its A380 order. For Airbus, there may still be a silver lining in the U.P.S. decision. The company has repeatedly said in recent months that the lack of a large order book for the A380 freighter made it possible for the company to focus its energy on delivering the 166 passenger versions of the plane to airlines as quickly as possible.

Scott Davis, said. “It’s just a moderating economy that we expect to get back on trend by the end of 2007, early 2008.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/technology/18ecom.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Last-Minute Help for Those (Mostly Male) Holiday Shopping Slackers<date>Published: December 18, 2006</date><text>IF women have any doubts that their men truly love them, this wont help. According to at least one poll last week, nearly half of all men in relationships had yet to buy gifts for their spouses. But forces of the corporate world are set to bail out shopping slackers yet again, only you wouldnt know how unless you somehow noticed that delivery trucks were making fewer left-hand turns than ever. Spurred by the growth of e-commerce, shippers like U.P.S. and others are shaving precious minutes from their delivery times by arranging shipping routes to avoid left-hand turns, among many other things. Online retailers, meanwhile, have tweaked their own product handling systems, thanks to improved technology and lessons sometimes painfully learned in years past. The result is that many online merchants this year will still sell goods with standard shipping terms through Monday, Dec. 18, or Tuesday, Dec. 19, thereby lending a hand to late holiday shoppers and, e-commerce executives hope, stealing more sales from offline merchants. Retailers and industry analysts said they expected the trend to help build sales, if not cure road rage, especially from procrastinators who in years past would have sped to the mall rather than go online and pay for expedited delivery service. Theres no question these sales are going to go right to our bottom line, because weve never been able to get the procrastinators, said Shmuel Gniwisch, chief executive of the online jeweler Ice.com, which pushed its standard shipping cut-off date closer to Christmas by one day this year, offering free two-day FedEx shipping for orders placed by noon on Dec. 20. They always went to the store. According to a poll by BizRate, a division of E. W. Scripps, 30 of 76 Internet retailers said they would guarantee standard shipping for orders placed by Dec. 18 or 19. That is double the number from last year, but the shift is even more profound, since in 2005 there were four business days between Dec. 19 and Christmas, versus three this year. A few years ago, such promises may not have made much difference to consumers, who had fresh memories of late packages from ToysRUs.com, Macys.com and others back in 1999. But retailers have managed to deliver packages on time since then, even while pushing their shipping deadlines closer to Christmas. Consumers are forgetting the fiascos of 1999 and are starting to replace those with positive experiences, said John Chandler-Pepelnjak, an analyst with Atlas, an online marketing technology company. Theyre brushing up against the tightest boundaries now, and they still have a reasonable expectation of getting their gifts. Mr. Chandler-Pepelnjak said that last year the peak online shopping day was Dec. 13, whereas in 2000 the peak came on the day after Thanksgiving. Another factor that could spur late sales this year, he added, was the propensity of consumers to shop online on Mondays and Tuesdays. I think people will do a lot of shopping on the 18th and 19th this year, he said. Although to me, thats cutting it close. John Thompson, a senior vice president at BestBuy.com, said his company had improved its own shipping acumen, and had also benefited from better coordination with U.P.S. As a result, he said, BestBuy.com had extended its holiday shopping deadline by one day for each of the last four years. The Friday after Thanksgiving was a huge day for us, and because we share forecast information with U.P.S., we knew we had the right size trucks  and enough of them  outside our facilities, he said. That was huge, and it worked as well as we couldve hoped. Among other things, Mr. Thompson said, BestBuy had gotten better at predicting the most popular items of the holiday season for various regions, and making sure those items were adequately stocked and ready for shipment from the closest distribution centers. Norman Black, a U.P.S. spokesman, said the company had become more efficient in its own right, announcing in March a new routing system that reduced by one day the average transit time for many popular routes. That technology system is a refinement of one introduced last year, that, among other things, reduced the number of left-hand turns encountered by drivers. Were aggressively trying each year to do more and more for our customers, largely because of e-commerce, Mr. Black said. As we do, and as our competitors do, customers start to trust you more and more, and that shows up in something as mundane as the date of the last recommended shopping day. FedEx has also improved its efficiency, said Mike Mannion, a senior vice president of FedEx Ground. Over the last three years, he said, the company had reduced by one day the time to ship a package across most of its routes. The company has added shipping facilities in major cities, allowing employees in Cleveland, for instance, to load Orlando-bound packages on a trailer bound directly for that city. In the past, packages from Cleveland would have been collected in Columbus, then put on trucks to Orlando. Increased volume has helped justify such expenses, Mr. Mannion said. In fiscal year 2006, FedEx Ground shipped more than 2.81 million packages daily, 8 percent more than the previous year. U.P.S., meanwhile, shipped 6.6 percent more packages during the first nine months of this year than during the same period last year. Mr. Gniwisch of Ice.com said the later shipping deadlines would help the company cater especially to men, who tended to shop later than women, and spend more. (Ice.com polled 400 of its customers last Tuesday and found that 46 percent of men who were in relationships had yet to buy a gift for their partners.) Ice.com this year had a comparatively conservative shipping deadline, of midnight Dec. 14, for those who chose free United States Postal Service delivery. But Mr. Gniwisch said the company was pushing it to the limit this year by offering two-day FedEx delivery for orders placed before noon on Dec. 20. In part, Mr. Gniwisch said, that was because his company reduced the amount of time required to processes an order this year, from 6 hours to 2.5 hours. Two years ago, it took 26 hours to process an order. Everybody gets better at this the longer you stay in business, Mr. Gniwisch said. You work out the kinks. More Articles in Technology »IF women have any doubts that their men truly love them, this wont help.

Eskew is known as a plain speaker. Yet Mr. Eskew, 57, is also a cautious speaker, who, when asked to compare his company with the competition  namely FedEx  demurs. Im not that kind of guy, he says. Skip to next paragraph Michael L. Eskew He is also reluctant to engage in conversation about the price of gasoline, which, after all, must be a constant anxiety to the man who runs the biggest package delivery system in the world: planes and trucks fueled by guess what. Finally, badgered by questions, he says the company is trying hybrid cars and weve done a lot with compressed natural gas. Oh, and, he says, those brown vehicles you see clogging up the city streets, they are emphatically not trucks. In a telephone interview this week, Mr. Eskew discussed friction with some of his franchisees, advancing technology and, of course, the Christmas season, when, on the companys peak day, Dec. 20, he expects to deliver 240 packages a second. Following are excerpts: Q. So what can you predict about this Christmas? A. Well, you know each Christmas is a little different, each one has a different personality. This year, well have almost the biggest span of shopping days possible: Thanksgiving fell on the 23rd  the earliest it could fall is the 22nd  and as we move through that last week, we are gearing up for huge volume. Q. Will it be your biggest Christmas ever? A. It could be; it depends on the weather. Q. Isnt your company  along with the other carriers  benefiting enormously from Internet shopping? A. Yes, its so different now, its so efficient; just point and click. Q. And it affects your international business? A. Oh, yes. This is our 30th year in Europe; for the last eight or nine years, weve had double-digit growth in Europe. Q. How does the rising price of gasoline affect you? Prices have moderated now, but they are still tremendously high compared with those we all grew up with? A. Our concern is that the cost of gas and energy eats into the pockets of the average consumer. Q. But what about your own fuel costs? A. We do our best to minimize those costs; weve made our routes more efficient and weve put two men on our package cars. Q. Package cars? A. Yes, we dont consider ourselves truckers; weve considered ourselves service providers since the days when I was delivering packages. Q. What is your most recent major change in the company? A. Within the last year, weve made significant refinement in the way packages are tracked. Now, you can go to the same tracking page on the Web, and see any kind of U.P.S. shipment movement. We made an acquisition of a trucking company and that has made it all much more simple. Q. I read some angry letters from some of the Mail Boxes Etc. franchisees, who didnt want to change the name of their store. What was that dispute about? A. Yes. We bought Mail Boxes Etc., and weve converted most of those franchises to UPS Stores. There are now over 5,700 UPS Stores and Mail Boxes Etc. stores, where before there were a little over 4,000. We test marketed the two brands  U.P.S. vs. Mail Boxes  and found that the U.P.S. name was much stronger. In the end, some of the Mail Box franchisees decided to end the contract. Part of our takeover included redecorating stores with our brand, which has been great for us. Q. How do you think U.P.S. stock is doing? Looking at its history, its price has seemed relatively stable, even in erratic times. It closed yesterday at $78.11. A. We like the way its doing. Weve only been a public company for six or seven years  and we think the stock has room to grow. Q. Is FedEx your biggest competitor? A. We trade at a slightly higher price/earnings ratio, but we have a much larger market cap. Weve been trying to expand the kind of things we do, theyre concentrating more on individual products. Q. Are there any specifics you want to brag about? Like how U.P.S. has year-over-year revenue growth of 15.8 percent, compared with an industry average of 4.2 percent? A. I dont do that. The best part of the business is the people in the brown suits: theyre better than any in the world.

The plane  the first of which was flown in 1970 by Pan Am after being christened by the first lady, Pat Nixon  was no longer in strong demand, as the world seemed to be moving to smaller, more fuel-efficient planes. And the new double-decker A380 from Airbus, Boeings archrival, had captured the industrys imagination, even though it was years from being built. The 747 was on a heart-lung machine, Howard Rubel, an aviation analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company, recalled. It looked like Boeing was about to shut it down. But a funny thing happened to the 747 on the way to the graveyard: it found a new tailwind, and a strong one at that. Demand is growing for the new 747-8 Intercontinental, which was introduced a year ago. Boeing now has 73 orders for the plane after its latest lift yesterday from Lufthansa, the big German carrier, which announced it was placing a $5.5 billion order for 20 747-8s, and took options to buy 20 more. Its taken us time to evolve the plane, said Larry S. Dickenson, Boeings vice president for sales, at a news conference yesterday. We think we have a winner. This reversal of fortune comes as Airbuss superjumbo A380 has stumbled, falling two years behind its delivery schedule amid persistent wiring problems and a management shake-up at the company. While Boeing takes pains to say that the two planes are not head-to-head competitors, the industry generally sees them that way. They are the only two planes in the very large category: The 747-8 is designed to carry up to 467 passengers, while the A380 can carry up to 555. In large part, the 747s new lease on life is owed to global trade. Until the Lufthansa deal was announced, all 747-8 orders had been for the freighter version of the plane. Even the initial orders for the latest model were for air freighters, an unusual move in an industry that likes to kick off new models with orders from high-profile passenger carriers. But, technological advances, particularly next-generation fuel-efficient engines, improved the economics of operating a four-engine passenger plane like the 747. The new 747 is an inexpensive way for Boeing to capture some passenger orders, a lot of cargo orders and make a fair amount of money because of the Airbus 380 hiccup, said Jon B. Kutler, chief executive of Admiralty Partners, a private investment firm in Santa Monica, Calif., that specializes in aerospace. The 747-8 is even being sold and outfitted by Boeing as a private jet much like Air Force One, which is a 747. Each plane carries a list price of about $275 million. Boeing will not identify the customers, but many in the aviation world say the orders are probably coming from people in the Middle East who are flush with oil riches. They are historically big buyers of Boeing jets for personal use. Of course, these events have not gone unnoticed at Airbus, which has lost some freighter orders for its A380 to Boeing in recent weeks. Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus North America, called the new 747-8 a brand-new Edsel, the famous new-car failure of the late 1950s. The 747 is on its last legs, Mr. McArtor said in an interview. It doesnt have any legs to stand on. Boeing is trying to breathe life into a 1960s-era design. There is only so much you can do with a plane. He added: But it is irritating. Boeing is getting orders only because of our inability to meet demand. Had we not stumbled with the A380, there would not be orders like the Lufthansa order for the 747-8. Boeing executives, not surprisingly, have a different view of the plane. The 747 is a plane that is tough to beat, said Dan Mooney, Boeings vice president for the 747 program. The 747 will do what our customers are looking forward to. We now have a plane that works for them. Todays 747, of course, is not the same as the one flown in the 1970s. The first version, the 747-100, featured a piano bar on the upper deck. Todays 747-8, which will be delivered in 2009, is longer, faster and will carry over 100 more passengers than earlier models. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »After air traffic fell off sharply following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Boeing 747, the hump-backed giant of the skies, appeared to have run out of lives.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge this Image A U.P.S. truck with a hydraulic hybrid system in Washington last week. Multimedia Graphic: Hold the Volts, Please Related The Scent of Danger? (June 25, 2006) But just as drivers have grown comfortable with concepts like regenerative braking and issues like battery life expectancy, new types of hybrids are emerging  including one that uses no electricity at all. For instance, a United Parcel Service delivery truck the government rolled out in Washington last week was equipped with a prototype hybrid system using hydraulic fluid and a high-pressure pump instead of electrical current and a generator. In this design, energy is stored in a series of pressurized tanks, rather than in nickel-metal hydride or lithium-ion batteries; the energy moves not as high voltage current in copper wires but as hydraulic fluid pressurized to thousands of pounds per square inch. Standing next to the truck painted with U.P.S.'s signature color, Stephen L. Johnson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: "Brown is the new green." The Army is testing a truck with similar technology and FedEx is watching with interest. The E.P.A., which holds some patents on the technology, has visions of full-size sedans that will go 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline, with better acceleration and lower emissions, at a cost premium so small that fuel savings will quickly pay for the hybrid hardware. A hydraulic hybrid is more specialized than the gasoline-electric hybrids sold today. It works better on heavier vehicles, and in stop-and-go traffic; backers say the ideal vehicle for this system is a garbage truck, but that it could work well in vehicles as small as S.U.V.'s. "We've always said there's a lot of flavors of hybrid," said Bill Van Amberg, executive vice president of WestStart, a government-industry research consortium. The hydraulic hybrid is conceptually similar to battery-electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius or the Honda Civic. It has an internal combustion engine, and its design makes it possible to store power for a while before sending it to the wheels. When the driver presses the brake pedal, the storage system may engage, slowing the vehicle by capturing the energy of its forward motion rather than using the brakes. This design, known as regenerative braking, is more efficient than conventional friction brakes which simply convert the vehicle's momentum into wasted heat. The captured energy can be stored and returned to the wheels when the traffic light turns green. A hydraulic hybrid has several advantages. One is that it can accept and deliver huge amounts of energy quickly, which batteries cannot. And its storage ability does not degrade over time, which is a fact of life with batteries available today. Generally speaking, though, hydraulic systems do not store as much total energy as an electrical battery does, because the storage tanks are bulky. The U.P.S. van has four "accumulator tanks" of 22 gallons each which can be pressurized as high as 5,000 pounds. When fully charged, the system holds 2,000 horsepower-seconds of energy, according to Benjamin M. Hoxie, engineering manager for hydraulic hybrids at Eaton, an automotive supplier that built the prototype, using technology developed by the E.P.A.. Stated differently, it could deliver 100 horsepower for about 20 seconds. In electrical terms, that is less than half a kilowatt hour  but no electric battery could absorb and deliver energy so quickly. When the truck is in operation, its diesel engine runs a pump to fill the storage tanks with fluid. The tanks contain nitrogen gas to When the driver presses on the accelerator, pressurized fluid is released from the high pressure tank and routed to the pump. The pressurized fluid pushes a piston down in its cylinder, recycling some of the energy to turn the vehicle's wheels. The company says that because the diesel engine runs at constant speed, it will have a head start in meeting the stricter pollution standards that take effect in 2010. The prototype truck has a 6-liter V-8 diesel engine but Eaton engineers say that with the hybrid system it could use a much smaller engine and still get the same performance; soon they will try a 4.5-liter V-6. But even using the existing engine, the truck is expected save about 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year, the company says. Hydraulic hybrids use technology that has been in service for decades, and unlike a computer-controlled Prius, they might not require a mechanic with an engineering degree to do repairs. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Automobiles »BY now, hybrid vehicles are familiar enough that buyers find nothing peculiar about a car's gasoline engine getting help from an electric motor.

The planes carry a list price, not including customer discounts, of as much as $236 million each. They will be delivered starting in June 2007, with the last arriving in 2008, Mark Giuffre, a U.P.S. spokesman, said. They will be used on flights between the company's hubs in Asia, Europe and North America, he said. James Corridore, a Standard &amp; Poor's equity analyst in New York, said: "It's definitely smart for U.P.S. to be ramping up their international capacity now, as opposed to later. Demand is there now and growing." The company is buying directly from Boeing for the first time since 1993. It chose the planes, which will use General Electric engines, in part because it could not obtain other jumbo aircraft quickly enough, Mr. Giuffre said. Boeing, which is based in Chicago, has dominated the jumbo jet market with its 747 for more than 30 years and is trying to stave off competition from the A380 made by Airbus of France. In January, U.P.S., which is based in Atlanta, ordered 10 A380 cargo jets valued at $2.8 billion from Airbus, with an option for 10 more. The planes will be delivered in 2009 through 2013.

But the high cost of oil already appears to be curbing growth, translating into unusually modest gains in employment and pay. If history is any guide, higher prices will hurt consumption, curb the nation's output and shift spending patterns. The risks of a domino effect on the economy are real, economists say. "We can't lose sight of the fact that energy restricts growth," said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. "It is doing so." So far, the economy has showed much more resilience in the face of higher energy costs than most analysts had anticipated. Although prices began rising in early 2002, consumers have kept shopping, companies have expanded and inflation has remained under control. At times, it seemed a new economic era had dawned. Without question, economists say, rising oil prices cause less economic pain than they once did. It takes half as much energy to produce $1 of gross domestic product today, adjusted for inflation, than it did 30 years ago. Even at today's prices, oil is cheaper than it was in the early 1980's, once adjusted for inflation. The falling costs of other goods, thanks in large part to global competition, have also helped cushion the blow from higher energy costs. While energy prices rose 3.8 percent from June to July, the price of all other goods inched up only 0.2 percent, the Labor Department said yesterday. "There seems to be a greater tolerance in the economy in terms of what can be withstood," said Doug Leggate, an energy analyst with Citigroup in New York. But a spike in oil prices still hurts, economists say, even if the pain does not come immediately. In the past, the full effect was not felt until a year, or even two years, after prices began rising. Both of the last two recessions - in 1990-91 and in 2001 - began more than a year after energy prices started a sharp climb. "It is way too soon to be sanguine," said Andrew J. Oswald, an economist at the University of Warwick in England, who has written about oil. "The influence of a petroleum shock runs deep and runs slow. My own view is that we will find oil shocks still hurt, and hurt fundamentally." It was only 13 months ago that the price of a barrel of crude settled above $40. Oil, which closed yesterday at $66.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, is not likely to become much cheaper anytime soon, analysts say. Nor are natural gas prices, which have gained 73 percent this year. This means that winter heating bills for American households are set to soar. 1 2Next Page &gt; Jennifer Bayot and Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York for this article and Jeremy Peters from Detroit.

In February last year, a magnetic tape with information on about 120,000 Japanese customers of its Citibank division disappeared while being shipped by truck from a data management center in Singapore. The tape held names, addresses, account numbers and balances. It has never turned up. And this week the company revealed that it had happened again - this time the loss of an entire box of tapes in the care of the United Parcel Service, with personal information on nearly four million American customers. Citigroup executives noted with a bit of chagrin that the Singapore incident had helped prompt a companywide transition to "secure electronic channels" for moving sensitive data - a process nearly completed. But not fast enough, it turned out. Indeed, while handing over the names, addresses, and Social Security and account numbers of millions of customers to a U.P.S. driver may seem anachronistic, it is in fact common, security experts and lawmakers say. While things are changing, the process of moving away from these vestiges of a bygone era - when the world was not coursing with electronic back alleys and computer-savvy thieves who just might know how to pull data and profits from reams of magnetic computer tape - needs to be kicked into high gear, some experts say. The problem of data security goes well beyond couriers and data tapes. And improving things takes time and money. When so much commerce is conducted online and when just a few bits of stolen data - a Social Security number, a name, an address, a date of birth - can be turned into cash by opening false credit accounts, thieves have proved themselves skilled at getting the information they need. ChoicePoint, a commercial data broker, was duped by con artists posing as legitimate businesses, allowing them to download sensitive information on thousands of consumers. And a thriving trade in credit card and bank account numbers continues to unfold on underground Web sites and Internet chat rooms. Combating the crooks requires a holistic approach to data security, said Mike Gibbons, a security consultant for the global technology services company Unisys, and the former chief of cybercrime investigations for the F.B.I. That includes creating more secure online access methods, robust customer authentication, hiring dedicated data security staff, and improving the way large amounts of consumer data are stored or moved. "All of these things have cost impacts," Mr. Gibbons said. "Businesses have to pony up the capital to change the way they are storing and holding data." Given that 10 million consumers are now falling victim to some form of identity theft each year, according to the Federal Trade Commission, the stakes are high. "I think there are some people who dismiss this as a sky-is-falling problem," Mr. Gibbons said. "But the sky has already fallen and it's just a matter of when a piece hits you in the head." Citigroup and U.P.S. said that the data loss reported this week at Citigroup's CitiFinancial division - the most recent in a long string of reported data losses and thefts at other banks, colleges and media companies - appeared to be a simple mishap rather than a result of foul play. But Mr. Gibbons said that in terms of public perception, the circumstances of the loss made little difference anymore. "There's going to have to be a shift in corporate thinking in managing these new business risks," Mr. Gibbons said. "The public won't stand for it." Anthony A. Caputo, the chief executive of SafeNet, a company that provides encryption technology high-speed networks as well as data-security services for the Pentagon and the Homeland Security Department, among other federal agencies, said that a reason sensitive data is still being transported using tapes and trucks is that "the amount of data being transmitted is frequently too much for an Internet connection," and creating secure, dedicated networks takes money and time. But, Mr. Caputo added, "over the coming years, or months, with so much focus on this, the data will be moved to networks." The impetus for change is almost certain to be legislative. A 2003 California law is widely credited with what Bruce Schneier, a highly recognized data security expert whose books include "Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World," calls the "public shaming" method of security enhancement. The law, which requires that the state's consumers be notified of security breaches involving data on them, has prompted a string of previously unheard-of corporate confessions - from big data brokers like ChoicePoint and LexisNexis, and from other financial and investment companies, like Wachovia and Ameritrade. That is a start, Mr. Schneier said, but he said the fact that highly sensitive data was still being shipped by courier - on unencrypted tapes, as in the CitiFinancial case and in a loss of Time Warner employee data in transit earlier this year - is evidence that data aggregators of all stripes, acting rationally, have no particular incentive to speed the adoption of new and expensive methods of handling data. "This is a capitalist society," Mr. Schneier said, suggesting that no company can be expected to spend money to improve things simply "for the public good." 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Perhaps more than most corporations, Citigroup knows the perils of moving personal data.

Executives at Citigroup said the tapes were picked up by U.P.S. early in May and had not been seen since. The tapes contained names, addresses, Social Security numbers, account numbers, payment histories and other details on small personal loans made to millions of customers through CitiFinancial's network of more than 1,800 lending branches, or through retailers whose product financing was handled by CitiFinancial's retail services division. The company said there was no indication that the tapes had been stolen or that any of the data in them had been compromised. It was, however, the latest in a series of recent data-security failures involving nearly every kind of institution that compiles personal information - ranging from data brokers like ChoicePoint and LexisNexis to financial institutions like Bank of America and Wachovia to the media giant Time Warner to universities like Boston College and the University of California, Berkeley. All these institutions have reported data breaches in the last five months, affecting millions of individuals and spurring Congressional hearings and numerous bills aimed at improving security in the handling of sensitive consumer information. The fear is that Social Security numbers, when combined with a consumer's name, address and date of birth, can be used by thieves to open new lines of credit, secure loans and otherwise steal someone's identity. Whether the recently reported breaches indicate an epidemic of data loss is unclear. Many privacy and security advocates have suggested that a California law, requiring that consumers be notified of data security breaches, has led to more confessions of data losses and increased awareness of a longstanding problem. "I think what we're seeing is a situation that's been going on for a long time," said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in San Diego, "and one which has only been made visible by California's law." The California law, which went into effect in July 2003, requires state government agencies as well as companies and nonprofit organizations - regardless of where in the country they do business - to notify California customers if the personal information maintained in their data files has been compromised. Yet in an age of transnational banks, Internet commerce and giant data aggregators, notifying only California residents when data on consumers all over the country is potentially lost or compromised has proved to be a public relations impossibility. (ChoicePoint was widely accused of planning to notify only California residents when it learned that information on at least 145,000 Americans had fallen into the hands of thieves; the company, however, said it was planning on nationwide notification all along.) Now, with each week bringing new reports of data loss, whether because tapes fell off the back of a U.P.S. truck or because data was electronically stolen by hackers or thieves, at least five other states - Arkansas, North Dakota, Georgia, Montana and Washington - have passed similar notification laws. As of last month, dozens of other states were considering similar laws. In the most recent incident, Citigroup executives say the box containing the tapes was handed over to U.P.S., along with other items for shipping, on May 2, under "special security procedures" that the bank required of the courier. One of those special procedures, said Citigroup's chief operations and technology officer, Debby Hopkins, included scanning the bar code on each package, rather than scanning only the single bar code on the shipment manifest, which is a summary document listing all the packages being moved in one shipment. According to Ms. Hopkins, just the summary document was scanned for the box, which was picked up in Weehawken, N.J., so U.P.S. was unable to track where in the delivery chain the box was lost. It was not until May 20 that an employee of Experian, the credit reporting agency that was to receive the tapes, called CitiFinancial to report that they had not arrived at Experian's data-processing center in Allen, Tex. An investigation by U.P.S. failed to locate the package. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Business &gt;In one of the largest breaches of data security to date, CitiFinancial, the consumer finance subsidiary of Citigroup, announced yesterday that a box of computer tapes containing information on 3.9 million customers was lost by United Parcel Service last month, while in transit to a credit reporting agency.

And leave it did. The owner of the six-foot-tall resin figure recently took it to the QuikDrop store on Long Island to have it photographed and put up for auction on eBay for 14 days. An online bidder from Utah paid $750 and the store's workers packed it and were preparing to send it last night. Next in line were 59 videotapes with several years' worth of "I Love Lucy" episodes, a pile of aluminum wheel rims and a Happy Holidays Special Edition 1988 Barbie. Such troves of junk are innocent enough. But as more eBay drop-off stores spring up around the nation to help redistribute the accumulated cargo of an acquisitive culture, some public officials worry that they could become unwitting fences for stolen goods. As some states push to regulate the industry, eBay and the stores are joining together to oppose oversight. States like California and Florida are debating whether drop-off stores like QuikDrop International, AuctionDrop and iSold It should be governed by the laws to prevent the sale of stolen items that currently apply to pawnbrokers, secondhand stores and auctioneers. The focus on drop-off operations is intensifying because they are multiplying rapidly. According to eBay, there are more than 7,000 locations listed in the company's directory of independent businesses, or trading assistants, that sell on behalf of others and offer drop-off services. Many of these, including about 3,800 AuctionDrop locations in U.P.S. Stores, are retail-style storefronts. And hundreds more of these stores are expected to open in the next year. The stores and eBay have no corporate connection, but they are closely linked. EBay's revenue growth is based in part on signing up new eBay sellers; the drop-off stores help bring into the eBay fold people who might be reluctant to hold an online auction themselves. In California, where the number of drop-off centers has grown quickly, secondhand dealers are required to report transactions, fingerprint people selling items like high-priced jewelry and electronic equipment, and hold onto those items for 30 days. EBay is lobbying against a proposed law that would set up an electronic database to track stolen goods sold at secondhand stores in California. The state attorney general recently released an opinion that the drop-off stores should be classified as secondhand dealers. EBay asked that the bill exempt the centers from regulation, but such an exemption has not yet been written into the bill. "We simply cannot see the need for any of this legislation," said Tod Cohen, vice president for government relations at eBay, which is based in San Jose, Calif. Some law enforcement agencies, however, argue that drop-off centers could well become conduits for stolen items as Internet-based crime rises. So far, there has been little evidence of stolen goods passing through drop-off stores. But law enforcement officials say that is because there is no easy way to track stolen items in and out of the centers. "People are using pawnshops less and less," said Danny R. Macagni, chief of police in Santa Maria, Calif. "These eBay drop stores don't have to notify us like a pawnshop, so stolen property could be sold and we'll never even know about it." The drop-off stores typically take in an item, photograph it and put it up for sale on eBay. If a sale goes through, the store sends the seller a check, minus a store commission that is often as high as 35 percent as well as a fee for eBay and other processing charges. If the item does not sell within a certain number of days (at QuikDrop, it is two weeks), the owner is asked to retrieve it. Chief Macagni said that as more commerce - and crime - move into the online world, increased monitoring of online sales can only help. State and municipal laws regulating pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers vary, but usually require that dealers report transactions to the police, hold items for a certain period before selling them, and even take fingerprints of customers. California, Florida and Texas have been considering legislation that would impose regulations on drop-off stores. And in New York City, where secondhand stores must obtain a license and maintain transaction records for police inspection on demand, the Department of Consumer Affairs is considering whether the drop-off stores qualify as secondhand stores, said Dina Improta, a department spokeswoman. EBay officials and store owners, however, say criminals are not likely to walk into a drop-off store, offer personal information, leave a telephone number and wait for a check to arrive in the mail. Still, lawmakers say legislation is needed as a deterrent.

Is Buying Overnite<date>Published: May 17, 2005</date><text>By Reuters United Parcel Service said yesterday that it would buy the trucking company Overnite Corporation for about $1.25 billion to add the ability to deliver heavier freight in North America. U.P.S. said it agreed to pay $43.25 a share for Overnite, a 46 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Friday on the Nasdaq. The Atlanta-based U.P.S., the world's largest package delivery company, said that acquiring Overnite would enable it to offer a variety of less-than-truckload and truckload freight services in North America.

The experience not only changed him personally but he says he feels it improved his team-building and problem-solving skills and made him a more sensitive manager. Along with others participating in U.P.S.'s community internship program - where executives leave their offices for four weeks to do community service working with local agencies, Mr. Sheppard cooked for the homeless at a shelter, worked with children in Head Start programs and spent time with elderly residents in need of companionship. At the same time, he enhanced his career. Last year, when an elderly woman living in a housing project complained to U.P.S. that she could not get to the door fast enough to sign for urgently needed medication, Mr. Sheppard looked into it. He found a pattern of problems with deliveries in the area and suggested to the tenants' association that drivers be permitted to leave packages at the community center. Nine housing projects now allow the practice. "Complaints are way down," Mr. Sheppard said. "This woman became a face behind a problem, and that's how I think all the time now. I look to see beyond what's apparent." The approach has paid off professionally: Mr. Sheppard was one of eight U.P.S. executives nationwide chosen for what is considered a plum assignment - training 3,000 supervisors in communication skills. About 65 million people did volunteer work last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and what motivates them is often very different from what motivated their counterparts a generation ago. Volunteerism today has an aura of deal-making at times: people want to give, but they also need to get, in the form of enhanced professional skills, real-life experience for their résumés and valuable business contacts. LaVerne Campbell, director of volunteer services for Volunteers of America, a service organization in Virginia with 90,000 volunteers nationwide, said that people increasingly come with specific projects in mind. They are college students, people looking for a career change and women who want to re-enter the work force after raising their children. "Even if they haven't yet decided what to do, they volunteer where they have a passion and it leads them to a new job," Ms. Campbell said. "Volunteering helps them build their skills." In February, Monster.com, a leading global online career site, joined with two Web sites - Idealist.org, which matches people with nonprofits, and boardnetUSA.org, which connects nonprofit boards with potential members - to start an online volunteer center that allows users to search for opportunities. A poll released in January by Monster showed that 66 percent of its users planned to seek volunteer work in 2005, up from 54 percent last year. Ami Dar, director of Idealist.org, said traffic at the site had doubled in two years and was now about 35,000 visitors a day. Human resource professionals say volunteer experience is invaluable for recent graduates without experience in their chosen fields. In fact, lack of experience is the No. 1 complaint of recent graduates searching for jobs at the online career network CollegeRecruiter.com, which has about three million visitors a month. "Graduates and students say they can't get an internship, a part-time position, anything," said Steven Rothberg, CollegeRecruiter's president. "We tell them to spend the time volunteering. Employers don't care how much you were paid to work; they want to see evidence you can perform the job." A few months ago, Jill A. Searing, vice president for human resources at Advanced Health Media, a medical marketing firm in Union, N.J., that coordinates speaker programs, hired a college graduate without any experience, on the basis of the woman's record of volunteering. "She volunteered as a student for an organization that did drug and alcohol prevention for teens and became their youngest board member," Ms. Searing said. "She also ran fund-raising programs for a cancer research organization. It showed me she was a very dedicated person and she had developed skills in planning she wouldn't have had otherwise. Absent that, we wouldn't have considered her." Skills honed or expanded through volunteer jobs can give internal candidates an advantage when vying for promotions; it also helps build the résumés of those wanting to switch careers. Two and a half years ago, Renee Martinez, an assistant customer service manager at the Denver office of Safeco, a property and casualty insurer based in Seattle, applied for her current position but was turned down and told she needed stronger presentation and communication skills. Because Safeco strongly encourages its employees to volunteer as a personal development tool, Ms. Martinez, a mother of three, joined the board of a support organization for young parents. Being on the board forced her to work with people of varying backgrounds and perspectives. "I learned how to influence someone making a decision or move a decision forward in a certain direction," Ms. Martinez said. Last fall, she was given the promotion at work. Web sites like Idealist.org and VolunteerMatch.org can be a starting point for deciding where to volunteer. Both offer free databases that list thousands of nonprofit groups looking for volunteers in a wide variety of capacities. Idealist.org allows prospective volunteers to post their profiles online. "The bottom line is that today volunteering can and should be approached very much like finding a paid job," said Susan J. Ellis, author of "The Volunteer Recruitment Book" (Energize, 1996) and president of Energize Inc., a consulting firm in Philadelphia that specializes in volunteerism. "Craft an assignment for yourself that lets you use your skills or learn something completely new. Then approach the organization with your proposal." Barry Miller, a career counselor and manager of alumni career services at Pace University in lower Manhattan, advises clients to examine a nonprofit's board of directors before deciding to apply there as a volunteer. "Are they influential people in your industry?" he said. Those board members could become important contacts and employment references later on, Mr. Miller said. Wherever you volunteer, branding yourself as a person who cares makes you a better job candidate, said Shel Horowitz, a marketing consultant in Northampton, Mass., and owner of Accurate Writing and More, a résumé-writing business. "It says to an employer: If you hire this person, you can trust them."</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5D8143DF935A15751C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">COMPANY NEWS; U.P.S.

Conceptually akin to gas-electric hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius, the approach uses a hydraulic transmission rather than a mechanical transmission with an internal combustion engine. Using technology developed by the E.P.A., the Eaton Corporation will take a familiar brown U.P.S. delivery vehicle and replace its mechanical transmission with one that stores and transmits energy using a pressurized fluid. The United States Army is among the project sponsors. Advertisement The vehicle's diesel engine will be used to create pressure of 5,000 pounds per square inch in a hydraulic tank and that pressure will drive a turbine that will in turn drive the wheels. Early lab tests show a gain in fuel efficiency of 60 to 70 percent, according to the E.P.A., and the sponsors are eager to try a real-world demonstration. "We're pretty sure we have something here," said Margo Oge, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency's air program. The agency owns several of the patents to be used in the vehicle. In mass production, the system would raise the cost of a standard truck by about $5,000 but would save about $2,500 a year in the cost of diesel fuel, she said. "What U.P.S. is seeing is a business case," she said. "What we are seeing is a huge environmental case that can be made for all of this, because of the potential reductions in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide." Sharp reductions in smog-forming emissions are also likely, she said. In the hydraulic system, a diesel engine running at nearly constant speed continuously builds and maintains pressure in a series of tanks. When the driver wants to accelerate, pressure is released to spin the turbine. The first vehicle will use a standard 6-liter, 175-horsepower engine. But a much smaller engine would work, the developers said, because the transmission uses stored power, much like a bagpipe uses stored air. A smaller engine would mean a lighter truck, and even less fuel consumption, they said. Diesel engines belch smoke when operating at low revolutions per minute and high torque, as when a truck begins to accelerate. But if the engine runs at a constant speed, as with the hydraulic hybrid system, pollution-control devices could be tuned to operate best at that continuous R.P.M. Another way the system saves fuel is by reversing the energy flow so that when the car needs to stop, the wheels drive the turbine and raise the pressure in the tanks. This "regenerative braking" is also common on gasoline-electric hybrids like the Prius, but in an electric system much of the energy cannot be recaptured because the batteries cannot absorb current fast enough. There is no such problem with the hydraulic system, which captures about three-quarters of the braking energy, compared with 35 or 40 percent for an electric hybrid. Although the system might be well suited to stop-and-go package delivery, experts say, it would be far less useful in vehicles that tend to operate more often at cruising speeds. The hydraulic hybrid has other advantages over the gas-electric hybrid, including cost and simplicity. The gas-electric hybrid has two entirely separate drive trains, and the second, the electric one, raises the cost by thousands of dollars. Because the hydraulic system replaces the conventional transmission, the projected additional cost is smaller than for a gas-electric hybrid. The U.P.S. hydraulic truck, still being built, would not be the first to use a hydraulic transmission. In Memphis, an independent tinkerer named John M. Hewitt is using a hydraulic system on what used to be a Chevy S-10 pickup. The truck, which he says accelerates adequately with an engine of less than 100 horsepower, achieves more than 100 miles per gallon. He uses a diesel engine designed for marine use, because it is meant to run long hours at constant speed. Ford Motor announced in 2001 that it was working with the E.P.A. on such a system for S.U.V.'s and hoped to have a fleet on the road by 2010. The company said it was now concentrating on gas-electric hybrids, instead.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/15/national/15rlist.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">The Deep-Pocket Donors to Bush's Second Inauguration<date>Published: January 15, 2005</date><text>ASHINGTON, Jan. 14 - Following is a list of companies, organizations and people who had given $250,000 to President Bush's second inauguration as of Friday, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee.

The rest of us have to pack presents in boxes and wait days, if not weeks, for them to reach their destinations. The Postal Service and the major commercial carriers - United Parcel Service, FedEx and DHL - handle almost two billion parcels during the holidays. Many are gifts sent by individuals whose good cheer may dim when they face long lines at drop-off sites, high shipping fees or, in the worst case, lost or damaged shipments. No one carrier has an edge in pricing, service or performance in all situations. But you can reduce the cost if you are strategic in your choice of gift, carrier and payment route. The best way to save money and grief would have been to mail packages before Saturday, when some carriers started to suspend delivery guarantees. Shipping after that increases the chance that the Christmas cookies you baked for Aunt Alice won't arrive in time. Procrastinating further and paying for expedited air service will cost 5 to 10 times as much as ground shipping. And even then, the package might end up lost, as Madeleine Sheehy of Houston discovered last year after she packed a holiday turkey and tamales in dry ice and sent them overnight to relatives in Wilmington, Del. "It was dinner and it didn't show up," she said. A small difference in weight can have a big effect on the shipping bill. A one-pound package can cost far less than one that weighs 1.1 pounds because carriers usually round up to the next pound. And a coffee-table book weighing 10 pounds is likely to cost more to ship than to buy. The same book will cost even more if you put it in a box, not a shipping envelope; boxes take up more space on the delivery truck. If you must send something big and heavy, it's less expensive to use U.P.S., FedEx or DHL. But the Postal Service "is a better deal if the package is less than five pounds," said Joe Loughran, president of SmartTran Inc., a consulting business in Pittsburgh that advises companies about shipping. The Postal Service is also a good choice if the recipient lives in a remote area, because commercial services are likely to levy a delivery-area surcharge of $1 to $30, depending on the weight. "It's the post office's mandate to deliver to every hamlet in the U.S.," said William Augello, who teaches transport law and logistics at the James E. Rogers College of Law at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The Postal Service is also a good bet when you are sending packages within your state or to a nearby state. But "the greater the distance, the more U.S.P.S. bulk-mail centers your package has to go through, and the more likely it's going to be missorted," Mr. Loughran said, adding that this is not the case with the commercial carriers, which have fewer sorting centers and handle less volume. Jill Jilek, a retired schoolteacher in Kalamazoo, Mich., said the holiday packages she sends every year through the post office to her brother in New Jersey tend to arrive in two days, while the ones she sends to her brother farther away, in Texas, can take four days to two weeks. Choosing a carrier based on price alone is not as simple as shopping among airlines for the best air fare. There is no Travelocity or Expedia to help find the cheapest option. You can go to each carrier's Web site for price quotations - as well as prepayment options and shipping labels. But look for asterisks, which indicate that the price quotations are only estimates; surcharges can increase the final cost significantly. (You'll find out the full charge upfront if you go to a drop-off site, but you'll probably have to wait in line.) At the Web site of FedEx, for example, you get a "courtesy quote" - with asterisk - but have to wait days, if not weeks, after the package is delivered to see what you actually owe. The Postal Service, on the other hand, may charge your recipient for additional postage if you incorrectly entered the package's weight or size online. Surcharges come in different varieties. For example, the big commercial carriers have a fuel surcharge of 13 percent this holiday season, reflecting the recent increases in gasoline prices. There are also fees for nonstandard shapes like cylinders: sending a rolled-up poster may cost more than sending it flat, between pieces of cardboard. And because the big commercial carriers cater mainly to businesses, they may also add a residential delivery fee of $1.40 to $1.75. To avoid that charge, Mark A. Taylor, chief executive of Taylor Systems Engineering, a company in Plymouth, Mich., that designs software to help companies cut shipping costs, said, "Either use U.S.P.S. or see if you can send packages to people's offices instead of their homes." And sending to a business, he added, "ensures there is someone there to sign for it." Independent pack-and-send outlets, which accept packages for the major carriers, can charge additional handling fees of $2 to $8. Shipping specialists say the Postal Service often has the fastest service, but its dependability can flag, especially during the holidays. For a combination of speed and reliability, they said FedEx was best, followed by U.P.S. and then DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post. But DHL has just completed a $1.2 billion expansion of its American operation, which Mr. Taylor said could change its profile here. Mr. Augello, the transportation lawyer, said none of the carriers stood out in terms of handling packages with tender, loving care. For best results, pack gifts carefully, use plenty of bubble packaging, and don't wrap the outside of the box with paper or tie it with string, as these tend to get caught in the sorting machinery. If a shipment is damaged, he said, be sure to save all the original packaging as proof that it was packed well. And writing "fragile" on your package "is a waste of ink," said Mr. Loughran, the shipping consultant. All packages get the same treatment as they trundle down high-speed conveyor belts and are tossed into cargo holds. Suspecting as much, Mary Beth Bishop, a potter in Durham, N.C., who ships her breakable wares to customers, friends and family members during the holidays, said, "You shouldn't ship it if you can't live with the thought of it getting busted."</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/business/yourmoney/12sship.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">8 Bags of Pecans, Delivered 4 Ways<date>Published: December 12, 2004</date><text>ECAUSE I could find no recent, unbiased studies of the relative performance of the Postal Service, U.P.S., FedEx and DHL, I did a little research of my own. Using each carrier's standard ground delivery service, I sent four identical two-pound packages of shelled pecans from Houston to the same business address in New York. I sent another four identical one-pound packages of nuts from Houston to a residence in California. My intent was to use the carriers' online services so I wouldn't have to wait in line. That plan was foiled by the DHL site, which takes several days to generate a new customer account. I had to go to an OfficeMax, where DHL now has counters. Web sites of other carriers allow customers to set up accounts immediately: FedEx and U.P.S. want your billing information first; the Postal Service lets you prepare a package without revealing your credit card number. I thought the Postal Service had the most convenient and user-friendly electronic service. Printing a label with a tracking number is free. And if you don't like paying for things online, you can pay for postage at machines at more than 2,500 post offices. Advertisement All told, the Postal Service was the least expensive - postage was $2.44 to California and $5.05 to New York - and the fastest (two days to California and New York), beating the others by at least a dollar and a day. The DHL packages took three and a half business days (including Saturday) to New York and three days to California; FedEx's took four days to New York and California; U.P.S.'s required five and a half days to New York and four to California. DHL, at $6.62, was the most expensive to California; U.P.S., at $6.40, the most expensive to New York. FedEx was in the middle, but as of Friday - three weeks after I sent it - I was still awaiting confirmation of the final charge, and my online account says I sent two packages to California, not one. When I called FedEx customer support, I learned that someone named Ernie Jenkins had sent that second package. I don't know Ernie, but I hope he's paying for it. Happily, all my pecans, wrapped in paper and slipped into Bubble Wrap mailers, arrived intact.

Bob Stoffel, senior vice president at United Parcel Service for its supply chain group, talked recently about ways to limit the risks of long-distance shipping. Here are excerpts from a conversation with him: Advertisement Q. What role is technology playing in the management of supply chains? A. A lot of technology is enabling things that weren't possible before, such as allowing us to see into the supply chain. We operate in a very dynamic environment, obviously, with security threats, wars, epidemics and a West Coast port strike a couple of years ago. Getting real-time information about where your goods are means that you can make smarter decisions about how to meet your customers' requirements. Q. Give me an example of what one of your supply chains can do. A. Take National Semiconductor. They have manufacturing facilities in Penang, Malaysia, and in China. We manage the distribution of their products from Asia to electronic and computer equipment customers. We can go from order to delivery within 72 hours anywhere in the world. Q. How have security concerns after Sept. 11 changed how you manage these chains? A. We work with our customers to declare the items that are coming into the United States before they arrive. Through electronic data interchange, we're able to access that information and pass it on to U.S. Customs. That avoids any delays. Q. But it still seems that these kinds of supply chains are vulnerable to any number of bad things. How can you protect them? A. The keys are information and visibility. You have to be connected to the whole supply chain and know who your reliable suppliers are. If you have multiple manufacturing providers, multiple trade partners, multiple freight forwarders, multiple airlines and other companies stringing together your supply chain, you can't see everything that is happening unless you have an integrated information technology system. As a result, we're seeing more single sourcing and risk mitigation taking place in the United States. By that, I mean there's more consolidation of supply-chain partners to streamline the processes and create more accountability if something goes wrong. If you don't have the footprint network around the world, you can't control the supply chain. Q. Is your global network big enough to control the entire supply chain? A. In our case, we don't have ships, but we can provide ocean service as a freight forwarder. We also could leverage other assets we have in case of a disruption. For example, we could use our aircraft fleet or our small-package network. Q. Still, if borders are closed and communications are interrupted, doesn't that disrupt these global supply chains? A. Not if you have visibility. We do contingency planning for the entire West Coast, for example. We knew in November that there was a backlog of ships at the port in Long Beach. There were 100 ships anchored at the port. There has been a shortage of dock workers and a shortage of trucks and trailers to move goods out of the West Coast. Also, the railroad situation wasn't good. It was sort of like the perfect storm. And it was all happening at peak season, as retailers were gearing up for the holiday shopping season. Q. How do you solve problems like these? A. We know what's on each ship and what's in each container. We know the timeline that our customers need these products by. So, as part of the Christmas planning process, we might even offload some goods into commercial or charter airlines. We might divert some traffic through the Panama Canal to come in via the East Coast. Q. If supply chains keep growing, is the logical conclusion that one day, very few things will be manufactured in the United States? A. Obviously, these supply chains provide an opportunity to move low-cost manufacturing. That's why you see some of the de-industrializing of the United States and Western Europe. But I see an increase in specialty manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe. There will be more final-stage assembly and final component manufacturing near the destination, wherever the customer is. If you can locate those functions near the consumer, you can reduce inventory. There will be fewer part numbers and less inventory sitting in the supply chain. You'll be able to differentiate those products. So I see more opportunities. Q. When I ordered a Dell laptop, it arrived at my doorstep directly from Malaysia and included components from Taiwan, Japan and other locations. If something that sophisticated can be assembled abroad, won't everything go that way? A. There are some specialized things you can't ship overseas. Take laptop repair. If you want to get your laptop back in a few days, you're not going to send it back to Malaysia. Q. So at the end of the day, all we have left is laptop repair? A. No, we're seeing this in different places in high tech. We're seeing it in semiconductor equipment manufacturing. And in telecommunications network equipment, we're seeing some final-stage assembly being done closer to the end consumer. Everything is not going away. It's just a different way of looking at manufacturing. William J.

BUYS CHINESE DELIVERY SERVICE, A FORMER PARTNER<date>Published: December 3, 2004</date><text>United Parcel Service said yesterday that it would extend its reach in China by buying direct control of services it has jointly run with a Chinese delivery company. In a deal worth $100 million, U.P.S. will take control of express delivery services in 23 cities and regions throughout China by the end of next year. The services have been part of a joint venture with the Sinotrans Group, a Chinese conglomerate. International delivery companies in China have been required to work in partnerships with Chinese companies, but the government has agreed to allow international companies to operate independently by the end of next year.

The strike, the first against United Parcel in Canada since 1991, affected about 1 percent of the company's 360,000 employees. A spokeswoman, Cristina Torelli, said ground shipments in transit would be delivered by nonunion workers. Pickups were halted three days ago. United Parcel, based in Atlanta, would not disclose the issues that led to the strike or the potential loss in revenue from the walkout. No new talks were scheduled.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/18/technology/circuits/18ship.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Delivery Web Sites Keep You Out of Long Lines<date>Published: November 18, 2004</date><text>OLIDAY preparations can try a shopper's patience. There's the hunt for a parking spot at the mall, the wait for a cashier and then the final indignity: waiting in line at the post office to ship all those gifts. Online shopping can alleviate some of the stress, and now the Web can also help shoppers avoid the post office. Shipping services are offered online by the United States Postal Service (usps.com) as well as FedEx (fedex.com) and UPS (myups.com). Some of the services these sites offer to consumers were previously available only to businesses that did a lot of shipping. Logging on to these Web sites lets senders plug addresses into a personal address book, calculate shipping costs, order pickups at home, print shipping labels and pay for it all by credit card. Shipping supplies, including boxes, can be ordered online in advance, too. Addresses and other information can be kept in free, secure accounts. Shipping online is convenient for people with a handful of packages to send (or after the holidays, to return), but online shipping services have been like fairy dust for small businesses that may have thousands of customer addresses in their database. Sharon Rowe, the owner of EcoBags Products in Ossining, N.Y., isn't worried about shipping this holiday season. She said she will be shipping about 100 packages of specialty canvas and net bags a day from her warehouse in Hamden, Conn., using an automated shipping system tied in to UPS. "It simplified everything," said Mrs. Rowe. "You hit a button that says Calculate Shipping, and it calculates cost based on weight, generates a label with a tracking number, and the tracking number gets linked to UPS." The system allows small businesses to print return labels, too, to include in their packages. Barry Brooks, the owner of cookiesfromhome.com, a specialty gift business in Tempe, Ariz., said that during the holiday season his company ships 100,000 cookies a day, 10 times the company's usual volume. When he started the business 23 year ago, he said, "we had to hand-write every line in the UPS book." Today shipping is automated through FedEx, whose trucks wait outside his bakery each day. Even those who are shipping a single tin of cookies can order pickups online. This service is convenient, but it comes at a price. UPS charges between $2 and $5 per pickup, and Fed Ex charges $4. There are ways to avoid paying these fees. Flagging down a driver is one way; they can accept a properly prepared package. Another is dropping off packages at the shipping companies' retail outlets, such as a UPS Store, FedEx Kinko's or the post office. UPS packages can also be dropped off at Staples. The United States Postal Service doesn't charge extra for pickup, which can be ordered online. And starting on Nov. 20, consumers can pay a flat $7.70 to ship a special Priority Mail box, regardless of weight or destination. A postage label can be printed from the computer, and senders can arrange for pickup the next day. If you are worried that your cookies might not actually reach their intended recipients, all of the shippers offer tracking services. Monitoring a package's progress seems to be a common holiday activity. FedEx said that last year it processed an average of 3.5 million tracking requests daily during the holiday season. On the busiest shipping day of the year, the Web site processed about 4 million requests.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/27/automobiles/27SCHW.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">Sleeping in a Delivery Van has Never Been Sweeter<date>Published: October 27, 2004</date><text>IKE many Texans, my father-in-law, John Mixon, chooses things that stand out. So when we rounded the corner on a tree-lined Brooklyn street, it was easy to find him: his bright red Sprinter towered above the sensible neighborhood cars. He and his wife, Judy, were visiting New York City from Houston, and had parked in front of the brownstone where Millicent, my wife's stepsister, lives with her husband. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com This was our first opportunity to see the Sprinter, which is built by Mercedes-Benz and commonly used in Europe as a delivery van or a tour bus, but a pretty uncommon sight in the United States. It is even less so in its incarnation as an eye-catching recreational vehicle that is big enough to serve as a rolling bedroom but small enough, at 22 feet bumper to bumper, to wedge into a generous parking space. The Mixons have joined the ranks of a small group of people who have taken to the roads in big-but-not-too-big vehicles that allow them to hit the road in idiosyncratic style. "When we roll into a campsite, the folks look at us like we're from outer space," Mr. Mixon said. They might be wondering just who it is who's cruising the country in a repainted United Parcel Service truck. Or, if they know something about the van's heritage, they might be burning with envy over the guy who's tooling around in the biggest Mercedes van they ever saw. Or they might just be seeing it as yet another example of how quirky the RV world remains. Recreational vehicle sales are booming in the United States, with wholesale shipments by August of this year rising nearly 19 percent over the same seven-month period the year before. The numbers are going up even faster for what are known as van campers, the smaller vehicles favored by people who believe that an RV does not need to be big enough to have its own gravitational field. They make up only 1.7 percent of all RV's that are shipped, but grew more than 21 percent in the first seven months of this year over the same period in 2003. And the Sprinter is an even smaller portion of that class. The van is sold in Europe with the iconic three-star Mercedes-Benz grille, and has been sold in this country as a Freightliner or a Dodge (which has not stopped many owners from buying a Mercedes grille for the European version and retrofitting their van with the status symbol). The buyer generally pays about $40,000 for the van, and then tens of thousands of dollars more to have it converted into an RV by companies like Sportsmobile in Austin, Tex., and Creative Mobile Interiors in Grove City, Ohio. Some people take on the job themselves. Andrew Bittenbinder, an automotive engineer in Pittsburgh, is converting his own van because he wanted a camper with a pop top with tent fabric, and could not find a company that could do the job. "It has been nine months of a few hours a day," Mr. Bittenbinder said, but he is on the verge of completing the body work and putting in a double bed "upstairs," where he and his wife will be able to sleep in the outdoors and feel the evening breeze. "No matter how much cargo, how much stuff you have downstairs, in one or two minutes you have a penthouse upstairs," Mr. Bittenbinder said. He is now moving on to the next phase: a removable galley so that the van can be used for camping, or for hauling a rebuilt Porsche engine to a customer. But few Sprinter owners  let's face it, few humans  have that level of skill or patience. Owen Connaughton, the president of Creative Mobile Interiors, said his company provided the kind of luxury conversions that the well-heeled might use for tailgate parties or to ferry executives around. One customer who was divorced and had three teenagers simply told him, "Build me something that makes them want to hang out with me." That van, which cost $157,000, included four flat-screen televisions with separate DVD feeds, a 1,200-watt surround sound stereo and in-motion satellite television.

But the company's stock fell $3.48, to $85.21, on concern that it would not be able to sustain its growth rate. The shares are up 26 percent this year. Kirk Schmitt, an analyst at KeyBank, which held 1.3 million FedEx shares as of June, said that recent gains had been helped by expense reductions, but that "most of the cost savings from the restructuring are behind them." Net income at FedEx, based in Memphis, rose 158 percent to $330 million, or $1.08 a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31, from $128 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 23 percent, to $6.98 billion. The $1.08-a-share profit met estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Last month, FedEx raised its quarterly profit forecast, to as much as $1.10 a share - 2 cents less than it reported yesterday - and its annual forecast to as much as $4.60, citing increased international and domestic manufacturing. In the United States, factory orders have risen for 14 consecutive months, buoying truck-shipment revenue. Ground shipments, mainly for packages, increased 16 percent, indicating that FedEx was taking market share from U.P.S., said Donald Broughton, an analyst with A. G. Edwards, who has a hold rating on the shares. "Demand for world air cargo is surging," Mr. Broughton said, adding that FedEx "is the biggest carrier in that business." But Jon Langenfeld, an analyst with Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, said the stock was being hurt by a drop in overnight package shipments in the United States, adding that higher fuel prices were prompting customers to use less expensive ground carriers. Stocks fell broadly yesterday, with leading indexes down more than 1 percent. Frederick W. Smith, the chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call that FedEx was adding 12 weekly flights to China in the next year to the existing 23. The company has forecast profit this quarter at $1.10 to $1.20 a share, compared with Thomson Financial's average estimate of $1.15.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/30/business/e-commerce-report-for-cut-proceeds-some-stores-will-help-you-sell-ebay-now-ebay.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">E-Commerce Report; For a cut of the proceeds, some stores will help you sell on eBay. And now, eBay will even help you find them.<date>Published: August 30, 2004</date><text>EBAY dropoff stores, which list, package and ship eBay items for people who cannot be bothered to do it themselves, have gotten a little help in their quest to find a market -- from eBay itself.Anyone looking for the stores would have, until recently, found almost nothing on eBay, even though at least 1,000 such stores exist solely to list more goods on eBay. But dropoff store operators say that some changes this month suggest that eBay could be steering them to more profitable waters. The company has begun promoting the stores on its site, listing them in a public database and creating standards of conduct to help keep sellers from handing their goods over to the wrong people.''This will give us visibility we need,'' said Jack Reynolds, a founder of QuikDrop International, a dropoff store franchise based in Costa Mesa, Calif.As a market, the dropoff stores are unproved, but Hani Durzy, an eBay spokesman, said the company was ''excited about the possibilities for these stores.''''We're watching intently,'' Mr. Durzy said, ''and figuring out what's the best way to support them without getting in their way.''He said eBay was treading carefully, partly because it had no direct financial stake in the auction dropoff businesses, which charge commissions of about 30 percent on items they sell. Last year, eBay said it would not open similar outlets, though such a move could conceivably increase the number of sellers on its site.Of eBay's 114 million registered users, roughly 90 percent are buyers, auction industry officials said. EBay would like to attract more sellers, but many people are unwilling or unable to take digital photos of their items, write competent descriptions and post the products on eBay for sale. New eBay sellers are also more skeptically regarded and their items fetch lower prices because they have no track record of successful transactions with which to market themselves.An army of auction assistants, typically individuals or small enterprises with experience selling their goods on eBay, has long stood ready to help sellers overcome such hurdles. More recently, though, some operations have started opening physical dropoff locations, and some of the more ambitious operations, like QuikDrop, AuctionDrop and iSold It, have begun expanding nationally.Even Circuit City has joined in. This spring, as part of a yearlong experiment, it opened what it calls Trading Circuits in eight stores.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/04/realestate/big-deal-ups-packages-parking-lot-for-eager-developers.html?ref=unitedparcelserviceinc">BIG DEAL; U.P.S. Packages Parking Lot For Eager Developers<date>Published: July 04, 2004</date><text>United Parcel Service has quietly been soliciting offers for a two-block-long parking lot it owns on West Street, which developers have long salivated over as an ideal spot for high-end apartments.''Now we're getting down to the nitty-gritty, we're getting down to the deal making, who's got what and what we want to do,'' said Bob Godlewski, a spokesman for the Atlanta-based company.An apartment building on the property, which runs from Spring Street to Charlton Street, would help string together the disparate developments that have popped up on West Street and its environs, from the green glass towers designed by Richard Meier at Perry Street to the celebrity-friendly Morton Square at Morton Street and the wavy-fronted building by Winka Dubbeldam, the Dutch architect, on Greenwich Street below Spring.Mr. Godlewski said the company reached out to about 25 developers early last year to gauge interest. He said U.P.S. has narrowed the field and is in talks toward reaching a deal. He declined to name the developers involved.U.P.S. uses the lot to hold tractor trailers waiting to be unloaded at a neighboring terminal on Greenwich Street. The company is seeking a deal that would still give it space for its trailers, such as continued access to part of the lot or a garage area.Mr. Godlewski declined to say when a deal might be expected. But three real estate executives aware of the bidding on the property said they believed U.P.S. had selected a developer and a contract was near. One executive said the 80,000-square-foot site was expected to fetch between $40 million and $60 million. The lot would have to be rezoned to allow an apartment house to be built.If a deal goes through, the lucky developer will want to speak with the Department of Sanitation, which has a garage across Spring Street, where garbage trucks are often lined up at the curb.A sanitation spokesman said the city planned to move the garage but had not yet found an alternative location.Feng Shui? Oy Vey!When Kim and Linda Renk, sisters who own a costume jewelry business called Sequin, moved into a new office and showroom at 234 West 39th Street recently, they were worried about negative energy.They had been told that the previous tenant, a fashion designer, had left the space after running into business difficulties and they were concerned about lingering bad vibes.</text></article></page></root>
