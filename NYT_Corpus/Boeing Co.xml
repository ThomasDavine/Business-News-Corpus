Buffett, take note. It is not just a few wealthy individuals paying unusually low taxes to the federal government. Corporate America is not far behind. A comprehensive study released on Thursday found that 280 of the biggest publicly traded American companies faced federal income tax bills equal to 18.5 percent of their profits during the last three years -- little more than half the official corporate rate of 35 percent and lower than their competitors in many industrialized countries. Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, has said that the tax code is unfair, allowing him to pay just 17 percent in federal taxes last year, about half the percentage his secretary paid. The corporate study, prepared by the left-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice, examined the regulatory filings of the companies to compute each year's current federal taxes. Some of the companies disputed the findings, saying that the study understated their tax payments by omitting deferred taxes that they may pay in future years. Using information from the companies' own corporate filings, however, the study concluded that a quarter of the 280 corporations owed less than 10 percent of profits in federal income taxes and 30 companies had no federal tax liability for the entire three-year period. The report is being released as corporations are pushing for a cut in their official tax rate, saying the current system puts American companies at a disadvantage with competitors abroad and encourages them to shift jobs and investments overseas. The Congressional supercommittee charged with cutting the budget deficit is also considering proposals to revamp the tax system, simplifying the corporate structure and possibly lowering corporate rates. The study said that the shelters and loopholes in the current tax system rewarded companies that aggressively avoided taxes at the expense of those that did not. A quarter of the companies in the study had a federal tax bill of 35 percent of their profits, while a similar number had an effective rate of less than 10 percent. ''Companies that are paying their fair share ought to demand that the tax-dodging companies pay their fair share too,'' said Robert S. McIntyre, the author of study. ''So should the public, which is subsidizing them in terms of increased federal debt.'' The report is based on data gleaned from the companies' regulatory filings, which can be different from their corporate tax returns. Even in a year when a company claims an overall tax benefit, it may pay some cash taxes while accumulating credits that can be redeemed in future years. But because most corporations do not release their tax returns, these corporate regulatory filings offer the best publicly available gauge of what companies pay and what strategies they use to reduce their tax bills. Among the companies that the study said escaped a liability for all three years were Boeing and Ryder System, whose chief financial officer, Art A. Garcia, said the company had benefited from the additional depreciation intended to stimulate the economy. Boeing officials said they, too, had paid some federal taxes, but would not say how much. They said they had lowered their rate by taking advantage of tax breaks intended to encourage hiring. Chaz Bickers, a company spokesman, said Boeing hired 9,000 American workers this year Also on the list was General Electric, which has come under close scrutiny since The New York Times reported earlier this year that the company had recorded $5.1 billion in American profits in 2010, but claimed a federal income tax benefit of $3.2 billion in its regulatory filing. ''The report is inaccurate and distorted,'' said Kenneth Juarez, a G.E. spokesman. He said G.E. paid ''billions of dollars in taxes in the United States over the last decade,'' but would not say what part was federal income taxes. The company that recorded the biggest reduction in taxes was Wells Fargo Bank, which is a large holding of Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. The banking company reported a total of $49 billion in profits in 2008 through 2010, yet received a tax benefit of $651 million. Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said much of the tax savings came from write-offs obtained after its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, which incurred big losses during the financial crisis. American corporations are paying a smaller share of taxes than in previous decades. They paid a total of $191 billion in federal income taxes in 2010, the Internal Revenue Service said, representing about 1.3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That is down from about 6 percent during the 1950s (although some of the decline is because a smaller percentage of businesses now file as corporations). Despite the decline in corporate tax rates since then, business advocates say the nation needs to lower its top rate further to encourage hiring and investment. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, said that the United States system was not competitive because it taxed income earned around the world, instead of just in this country. ''There are still Bolsheviks who recognize that we need to bring the rates down,'' he said. But the Citizens for Tax Justice study found that two-thirds of the American companies with significant profits overseas actually paid more in taxes to foreign governments than they did in the United States. Rather than lowering the corporate rate more, the study said, the federal government should end the subsidies and shelters that favor companies that game the system. ''Closing the loopholes will have real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources to improve our roads, bridges and school -- things that are really important for economic development here in the United States,'' the report said.

Boeing’s chief financial officer, James A. Bell, said Wednesday that individual plane sales would not become profitable until 2015, but that under accounting rules, the Chicago-based company would be able to average the low, single-digit profit over all of the first 1,100 planes sold, which is expected to take about a decade. The company expects that profit level to increase when production costs decline, he added. It expects to sell 5,000 787s in the next 20 years, he said. The 787 is the first commercial airliner made substantially with lightweight carbon composites, which promise to cut fuel costs for airlines. All Nippon Airways, the first 787 customer, inaugurated service with the 787 on Wednesday, taking 240 people from Tokyo to Hong Kong on a four-hour, 10-minute flight. The Japanese airline expects to take delivery of several more 787s by year-end. Because of the production problems, Boeing is having to redo a significant amount of work on the first 40 to 45 planes. But it also has orders for 821 planes, the most for a new commercial jet. Boeing earned $1.46 a share in the third quarter, up from $1.12 a share a year earlier and well above the average of $1.10 a share that analysts had expected. Boeing’s net income rose 31 percent to $1.1 billion for the quarter, from $837 million a year ago. Sales rose 4.5 percent to $17.7 billion from $17 billion. The company also raised its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $4.30 to $4.40 a share from the previous estimates of $3.90 to $4.10. But it said that given the rework issues and other problems, it would deliver only 15 to 20 of its 787s and new 747-8 freighters this year, down from a previous estimate of 25 to 30 in combined sales. It also cut its estimates of total plane deliveries for 2011 to 480 from between 485 and 495. Boeing said revenue for its commercial airplane division rose to $9.5 billion in the third quarter, from $8.7 billion a year earlier. Revenue for its military business was flat at $8.2 billion, though cost-cutting helped the company increase its profit in that area. Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics also reported Wednesday that they had topped quarterly earnings forecasts.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/a-new-use-for-leds-mind-control/?ref=boeingcompany">A New Use for LEDs: Mind Control<date>October 7, 2011, 8:37 am</date><text>NASANASA will use this LED light to adjust astronauts’ circadian rhythms. Fred Maxik wants to make a light bulb that will help you sleep. “Biological specific lights,” tuned so as not to interfere with an individual’s normal production of melatonin, the hormone secreted from the pineal gland linked to sleepiness, could begin to hit the market in about two years, according to Mr. Maxik, a founder of the Lighting Science Group, which specializes in LED bulbs. With a biological bulb, you could read at night without experiencing the nagging irritability that can occur after using a computer or sitting close to a lamp near bedtime. And other bulbs — or the same bulb programmed via a network— could help make consumers feel more refreshed in the morning by choreographing their wake-up ritual. “We could even do things like lights for sterilization, with photo catalysts” for bathrooms in perhaps five to six years, he added. While solid state lights and LED bulbs have been promoted as a tools for energy conservation, industry experts and executives suggest that efficiency will become a Trojan horse for a host of unexpected and arguably more valuable applications. Light-emitting diodes, after all, are semiconductors that can be programmed to emit light at precise wavelengths, colors and tones. Traditional light bulbs, the last vestige of the vacuum tube era, produce light with hot gases or wires. Greater control over light would ideally lead to greater control over the surrounding environment, researchers suggest. “Light has these biological and behavior effects — why not build on it?” said George C. Brainard, a professor of neurology at the Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University and one of the leading researchers in the field. Dr. Brainard predicts that over the next decade or two, health benefits will come to be considered one of the primary attributes of bulbs along with energy consumption, aesthetics and brightness. He and Lighting Science are working with NASA on LED lights that are intended to allow astronauts to better adjust to phenomena like the 90-minute “days” experienced on the orbiting International Space Station. Boeing included LEDs in the cabin of the new 787 Dreamliner that dim and increase in intensity to slightly adjust the circadian rhythms of passengers on transcontinental flights. The hope is that it will help passengers more easily adjust to jet lag. Meanwhile, researchers at Japan’s Keio University and elsewhere have experimented with LED traffic lights and car taillights that emit photons in pulses like optical fibers. While humans can’t visually perceive the difference, the pulses serve up a data stream about traffic conditions or potential accidents. “An LED is a light source, but it is an infinitely controllable source,” said Zach Gentry, an executive at enLighted, a company that combines LEDs with temperature, light and occupancy sensors to produce a device that monitors energy consumption and physical activity in office buildings. EnLighted just raised $14 million in capital. The National Institute of Mental Health discovered the connection between light and health in 1980 in an experiment that showed bright white light could suppress melatonin production. A few years later at Harvard, scientists demonstrated that circadian rhythms could be disrupted. Then in 2001, Dr. Brainard found that circadian rhythms could be disrupted with fairly low levels of blue light. He and others concluded that the eye must have undiscovered photoreceptors sensitive to blue light that perform nonvisual functions. It was a somewhat radical notion, but a year later, scientists at Brown University and Johns Hopkins physically isolated the receptor. Light therapy is already used to treat seasonal affective disorder and premature infants. The Lighting Research Center at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has noted associations between disruptions in the natural light-dark cycle and increased incidents of insomnia and breast cancer. Traditional light sources can have the same physiological impact. LEDs, however, are easier to control. More important, the physiological effects can be triggered with comparatively low levels of blue light, which LEDs emit natively. White light LEDs are actually blue LEDs covered by a yellow phosphor. Tinkering with the phosphors or combining blue and “white” LEDs in the same bulb could result in a somewhat more economical, compact “health” bulb. While mood lighting for ordinary consumers remains a few years out, the public has already begun to experience some of the hidden benefits of LEDs. Many upscale retailers have installed LEDs to achieve special lighting effects or to make jewelry cases sparkle. Subway, the sandwich chain, is installing LED fixtures from Lunera Lighting in some outlets to enhance their appearance. “You can create a color perspective that makes people look good,” said Don Peifer, one of the company’s co-founders. Before starting up Lunera, which specializes in LED fixtures that evenly “wash” offices and lobbies with light, Mr. Peifer worked as a lighting designer for photographers like Annie Leibovitz and Steven Klein. Lunera has also installed fixtures in eBay’s data centers that eliminate vertical shadows in computer racks. Redwood Systems, another Silicon Valley start-up, and enLighted are combining LEDs with temperature and occupancy sensors to help retailers determine whether consumers stop at certain aisles and whether check-out lines are growing shorter or longer. Humans and artificial lighting have never been an ideal combination. Circadian disorders result from placing humans in unnatural situations. “Before the Industrial Revolution, people worked in fields,” Mr. Peifer said. “There was a really strong dichotomy between night and day.” Maybe LEDs can restore some of the balance. “We don’t know what will happen in the future of lighting, and that is the exciting part of it,” Mr. Peifer said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/business/global/airbus-raises-its-forecast-for-aircraft-demand.html?ref=boeingcompany">Airbus Raises Its Forecast for Demand<date>Published: September 19, 2011</date><text>PARIS — The European plane maker Airbus raised its long-range forecast for commercial aircraft demand Monday, citing expectations of increasing wealth in fast-growing Asia and the continued expansion of low-cost airlines in the United States and Europe.Airbus predicted that airlines would buy 27,800 new jets by 2030. That estimate was up 7 percent from a forecast of 26,000 planes, which was made last December before orders this year for new Airbus jets from Asian carriers. The company said the new orders would be worth $3.5 trillion, up 9.4 percent from the $3.2 trillion forecast nine months ago. Its forecast is for aircraft that seat 100 or more passengers. Airbus said it expected passenger traffic globally to grow at an annual rate of 4.8 percent over the next two decades, just below the approximately 5 percent average rate of the last 30 years. According to the Airbus forecast, more than a third of the demand for new planes will come from the Asia-Pacific region, particularly from India and China. Domestic air passenger traffic in India and China is expected to grow at an average annual pace of 9.8 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, over the next 20 years. This year Airbus received major orders from Asia for its single-aisle jets, including a $18 billion deal for 200 planes from AirAsia, the Malaysian low-cost airline. It had two large deals with Indian carriers: a $16.6 billion sale of 150 planes to GoAir and a 180-plane order from IndiGo, worth $16 billion. By 2030, Airbus predicted, travel within Europe and North America would each represent about one-fifth of global passenger traffic and new aircraft demand, down from just under one-third each today. Airbus forecast that domestic travel within the United States would represent the biggest region in terms of overall traffic flows, as measured by the revenue that airlines earn per available seat for each mile flown, at 11.1 percent of the total. Europe would represent 7.5 percent of revenue per seat mile. John Leahy, the chief salesman at Airbus, acknowledged that the current economic climate was likely to lead to below-average growth in demand for air travel at least through 2012. But he emphasized that the long-term growth trends in air travel had remained consistent for at least three decades. “While we experienced a kind of ‘lost decade’ in the period since Sept. 11 in terms of economic growth, air traffic over that same period is still up by 45 percent,” Mr. Leahy said. “Over the next couple of years, we do expect to see another slow growth period, but we don’t foresee a double-dip recession,” he added. The majority of new jet sales were expected to be in the single-aisle category of planes like the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, which normally seat about 150 passengers. Airbus predicted that nearly 70 percent of sales over the next 20 years — 19,200 aircraft worth $1.4 trillion by 2030 — would be of this type. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 19, 2011 An earlier version of this article provided incorrect figures for forecast annual domestic air traffic growth in the United States and Europe for the period 2011-2030. Airbus predicted average growth of 2.4 percent per year over the period, not 11.1 percent, while intra-European traffic was predicted to increase by an average 3.2 percent, not 7.5 percent.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/business/house-approves-bill-restricting-nlrb.html?ref=boeingcompany">House Approves Bill Restricting N.L.R.B.<date>Published: September 15, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — The House voted on Thursday to approve a Republican-backed bill that would prohibit the National Labor Relations Board from trying to block Boeing from operating a new $750 million aircraft assembly line in South Carolina. The largely party-line vote was 238 to 186.Republicans denounced the labor board’s case against Boeing, asserting that the board was overreaching its authority and should not be dictating where companies can locate their operations. But many Democrats and union leaders condemned the legislation, arguing that it undercut an independent federal agency and favored Boeing, a potent lobbying force and prominent political donor. Under the bill, an unusual effort to curb a federal agency’s actions in a pending case, the labor board would be barred from seeking to have an employer shut, transfer or relocate employment or operations “under any circumstances.” The bill, called the “Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act,” is expected to face a battle in the Democratic-controlled Senate. In the House vote, the partisan divide was clear: only eight Democrats voted for the bill and only seven Republicans voted against. Republicans have repeatedly criticized the board’s acting general counsel for filing a complaint against Boeing last April, accusing the company of building an assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., as a form of retaliation against unionized employees in Washington State who have engaged in five strikes since 1977, including a 58-day-walkout in 2008. The National Labor Relations Act prohibits companies from taking any actions, whether firing employees or relocating a factory, against workers for exercising federally protected rights that include forming a union or going on strike. Republicans asserted that the N.L.R.B.’s move was causing some foreign companies to think twice about opening operations in the United States, while Democrats said the bill would speed the exodus of American jobs overseas. Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said: “This legislation represents an important step in the fight to get our jobs back on track. It tells job creators they don’t have to worry about an activist N.L.R.B. telling them where they can locate their business.” But Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, said the bill “would be devastating to workers across this country.” “It makes it easier to shift jobs overseas,” he said. “It eliminates the only remedy to force companies to bring back work from overseas. This outsourcers Bill of Rights is not only bad for the interests of workers, it’s bad for the economy at large.” The Boeing case is pending before an administrative law judge, who is to decide whether to order Boeing to move the South Carolina production plant, which assembles 787 Dreamliners, to Washington State. The House bill has a retroactivity clause that would bar the labor board from seeking such an order. Republicans argue that the bill would still let the labor board pursue many other remedies, among them back pay, although the opening of the assembly line in South Carolina has not caused any layoffs of Boeing workers in Washington State. But officials with the machinists’ union say 1,800 may soon be laid off after the new plant gets up to speed. The labor board’s acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, said on Wednesday that his decision to file a complaint against Boeing “was based on a careful investigation and a review of the facts under longstanding federal labor law.” “The decision had absolutely nothing to do with political considerations, and there were no consultations with the White House,” he said. “Regrettably, some have chosen to insert politics into what should be a straightforward legal procedure. These continuing political attacks are baseless and unprecedented.” The general counsel is independent from the full labor board and prosecutes cases asserting unfair labor practices. To prove that Boeing’s move was retaliatory, Mr. Solomon pointed to statements by top Boeing officials saying their unhappiness over past strikes motivated them to build the South Carolina plant. But Boeing officials say South Carolina’s low production costs were the reason behind the move. Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, applauded the House vote. “The N.L.R.B.’s actions are having a chilling impact on job creation and causing a great deal of uncertainty for manufacturers throughout the country,” he said. “Today’s vote is just one step in the process of reining in this rogue agency.” More than 250 professors signed a letter criticizing the legislation as “unprecedented interference with a pending legal proceeding for the benefit of a particular employer.” They said the legislation would severely diminish the board’s power to move against employers that illegally retaliate against unionization efforts or protests over working conditions by moving their operations elsewhere. They note that the bill would bar the labor board from bringing actions like the one against a California jewelry manufacturer that announced it was shutting its California operation and moving it to Mexico after its 118 workers voted to unionize. After a federal judge ruled that the company’s move was an illegal, retaliatory action, the jewelry company agreed not to move the plant.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/another-view-why-c-e-o-s-need-to-engage-washington/?ref=boeingcompany">Another View: Why C.E.O.'s Need to Engage Washington<date>September 15, 2011, 2:18 pm</date><text>Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Nels Olson is vice chairman and co-leader of the Board and C.E.O. Services Practice at Korn/Ferry International. American chief executives fall into two camps: those who relish opportunities to engage with Washington and those who engage only when threatened with a subpoena. This notion of engagement is even more relevant at a moment when the United States is struggling with high unemployment, slow economic growth and yawning budget deficits. In the coming months, Washington will be making decisions about federal spending and tax policy that will reshape the government’s fundamental role in the American economy for years to come. At the same time, both Congress and the Obama administration are under increasing pressure to find ways to create jobs and kick-start growth as the 2012 election approaches. As a result, chief executives and business leaders from companies of all shapes and sizes will almost certainly find their local representatives and senators eager to hear a private-sector perspective from outside the Beltway. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ivan Seidenberg, the former chief executive and chairman of Verizon, fits the archetype of the corporate leader who sees the long-term benefit of having a presence in the capital. As chief executive, he frequently met with regulators, members of Congress and White House officials (including invitations to speak with the president with other chief executives). President Obama named him to the President’s Export Council in July 2010, and he served for three years as chairman of the Business Roundtable, the Washington-based group that advocates pro-business policies. Among the senior executives working for him at Verizon are a former congressman and Verizon executive vice president for public affairs, Thomas Tauke; and a former general counsel for the United States trade representative, Peter Davidson, now senior vice president for government relations at Verizon. Also among them, until 2008, was William B. Barr, a former attorney general of the United States. “I’ve focused on Washington because it’s essential to the long-term health of Verizon, but also because I want to help develop solutions to the nation’s pressing problems,” Mr. Seidenberg said. As the White House, policy makers and legislators grapple with issues like deficit reduction, spending cuts and tax changes, engaging Washington is critical for corporate leaders, given the ramifications of regulation, taxation, global trade and more. While this is understood by top executives like Mr. Seidenberg and others, there is a clear need for leaders from outside the Fortune 500 to similarly ratchet up their efforts to have their voice heard and address what Mr. Seidenberg has characterized as “a growing disconnect between Washington and the business community.” Why Washington Engagement Matters The federal government and, to a lesser extent, state government are deeply entwined in sectors throughout the American economy. Regulation, in particular, can affect companies significantly and in unexpected ways, given that statutes are regularly being modified in a range of areas, including environmental protection, consumer privacy and workplace conditions. It is far preferable to try to influence the process than be stuck responding to the result. “If you’re not engaged, you can wake up one morning and find a big problem on your hands,” said Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive of Boeing, who is acutely aware of the need to develop relationships in Washington, given that the company is consistently the second-largest recipient of United States government contracts after Lockheed Martin. There is some evidence that companies increasingly recognize the likelihood of public policy’s affecting their operations, based on the findings of a McKinsey global survey of business executives in February. Among survey respondents from companies in North America, 71 percent said they expected increased involvement from both government and regulators — the highest percentage of any region in the world. Another indicator is that membership in the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of leading American companies, has increased to 205 from 143 over the past 12 months. How Chief Executives Should Engage The engagement of chief executives with Washington can take many forms. The traditional steps of making campaign contributions, joining trade associations and hiring government relations staff members remain important. But they are no longer sufficient. Mr. McNerney of Boeing recommends that work on public policy issues become one of the experiences expected of executives as they rise through ranks toward the chief executive’s office. “It is more important than ever to have experience with Washington built into the background of people who run companies,” he said. Reinforcing the importance of chief executive involvement is the proliferation of advocacy efforts by those who are not chief executives. In 2010, there were nearly 13,000 registered lobbyists in Washington. The large number of lobbyists creates more competition for companies as they seek to deliver their message to policy makers. “You can’t outsource the Washington knowledge to external lobbyists or your in-house government relations people,” says Bill Green, chairman and former chief executive of Accenture. “As a C.E.O., you have to have some level of depth on the issues of the day and the issues that could affect your company in the future. Relying solely on the government relations folks to raise the red flag is not sufficient and does not serve your shareholders well. In today’s world, you have to be part of the ongoing dialogue.” But even with their stature and mastery of issues, chief executives must be prepared for challenges and frustrations, said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. “There’s generally no one person you can talk to who can make the decision.” “Because Washington has 536 independent subcontractors, you have to do a lot of talking and a lot of participating to get buy-in,” Mr. Cote said, referring to the president and all members of Congress. “That can be frustrating for us who are used to talking to one person and getting a problem solved. But that’s the way it works, and you have to participate.” The Benefits of Engagement Washington engagement is undeniably a form of risk management — developing the relationships with officials that can help a chief executive to resolve differences (policy or otherwise) before they strike at the heart of a company’s brand or balance sheet. But engagement should not be viewed entirely as a defense mechanism. Being positioned to shape policies as they develop, and to seize opportunities emanating from policy changes, can also be a catalyst for corporate growth. And a healthy, vibrant relationship between chief executives and Washington, resting on communication and cooperation, will ultimately translate to a stronger, more dynamic economy that can deliver higher levels of job creation and greater prosperity for the American people.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/business/boeing-plant-is-expected-to-get-lift-from-house.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Plant Is Expected to Get Lift From House<date>Published: September 14, 2011</date><text>Leading House Republicans on Thursday will take up the contentious debate over the National Labor Relations Board’s efforts to block Boeing from operating a $750 million aircraft assembly line in South Carolina instead of Washington State.The Republican-controlled House is expected to approve an unusual bill that would bar the labor board from pursuing the board’s pending action against Boeing, which Republicans have been denouncing day after day. Republican leaders and business groups are vigorously backing the bill, saying it would safeguard the freedom of corporations to locate operations where they want. But many Democrats and labor unions have denounced the bill, asserting that it would badly weaken an independent federal agency and be an improper favor to Boeing, a prominent political contributor. The Republican bill, called “The Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act,” would prohibit the labor board from “ordering any employer to close, relocate or transfer employment under any circumstances.” Republicans are angry that the labor board’s acting general counsel filed a complaint against Boeing in April, asserting that the company had built an assembly line in South Carolina to retaliate against unionized workers in Washington State for engaging in numerous strikes. The National Labor Relations Act bars employers from taking any actions, including transferring an operation, in retaliation against workers for exercising their federally protected rights, including forming a union or going on strike. Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and the House majority leader, has condemned the board’s move, calling it an “overbearing action” that discriminates against right-to-work states in the South and makes it “nearly impossible” for Boeing to add additional workers. Several Republican presidential candidates have also criticized the complaint. For example, Mitt Romney visited South Carolina last Monday and called the move “an egregious example of political payback, where the president is able to pay back unions for the hundreds of millions of dollars they put in his campaign.” The labor board is an independent agency that enforces federal laws regarding unionization and labor-management relations in the private sector. The president appoints its board members and general counsel, who is independent from the board and prosecutes cases claiming unfair labor practices. The acting general counsel, Lafe E. Solomon, has asked an administrative law judge in Seattle to order Boeing to move the production line, which will build seven planes a month, from South Carolina to Washington State. The House bill to halt action against Boring has a retroactive provision that would nullify labor board complaints, like the Boeing one, for which “final adjudication” has “not been made.” If the administrative law judge rules against Boeing, the company could appeal to the full board itself. Mr. Solomon issued a statement Wednesday, saying his decision to issue a complaint against Boeing “was based on a careful investigation and a review of the facts under longstanding federal labor law.” “The decision had absolutely nothing to do with political considerations, and there were no consultations with the White House,” he said. “Regrettably, some have chosen to insert politics into what should be a straightforward legal procedure. These continuing political attacks are baseless and unprecedented and take the focus away from where it belongs — the ongoing trial in Seattle.” To prove that Boeing’s decision to assemble the 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina was retaliation, Mr. Solomon pointed to statements by top Boeing executives saying their dismay about past strikes was motivating them to open the production line in North Charleston. But Boeing officials say low costs were the reason they located the plant in South Carolina. Some assembly began there this summer. Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s president, said the Republican bill was “sleazy legislation,” and added, “This is sweeping legislation that would gut the National Labor Relations Act and result in serious harmful changes to workers’ rights throughout the country.” He said that if the bill passed, the labor board would be powerless to stop an employer from moving an operation to punish workers who staged a protest against unsafe conditions or sexual or racial discrimination. Republicans have voiced confidence that the bill will pass the House, which they dominate. But Bill Samuel, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s legislative director, said defeat of the bill was possible, although he said the bill’s chances were not good in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican and chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has strongly backed the bill. “No government board should have the authority to dictate where a private employer can run a business,” he said. But Representative George Miller of California, the committee’s senior Democrat, said the bill was “the Outsourcers’ Bill of Rights.” He said that Republicans were pushing the bill “to change the rules midtrial on behalf of one Fortune 500 company.” Aric Newhouse, senior vice president for policy and government relations with the National Association of Manufacturers, said the action against Boeing was hurting job creation and discouraging investment in right-to-work states.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/opinion/nocera-how-democrats-hurt-job-creation.html?ref=boeingcompany">How Democrats Hurt Job Creation<date>Published: August 22, 2011</date><text>The airplane’s aft section arrived early Monday morning. That’s what they’d been waiting for at the final assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C. They already had the wings, the nose, the tail — all the other major sections of Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner. With the arrival of the aft, the 5,000 nonunion workers in the plant can finally begin to assemble their first aircraft — a plane three years behind schedule and critical to Boeing’s future.The Dreamliner is important to America’s future, too. As companies have moved manufacturing offshore, Boeing has remained steadfast in maintaining a large manufacturing presence in America. It is America’s biggest exporter of manufactured products. Indeed, despite the delays, Boeing still has 827 Dreamliners on order, worth a staggering $162 billion. Boeing’s aircraft assembly has long been done by its unionized labor force in Puget Sound, Wash. Most of the new Dreamliners will be built in Puget Sound as well. But with the plane so far behind schedule, Boeing decided to spend $750 million to open the South Carolina facility. Between the two plants, the company hopes to build 10 Dreamliners a month. That’s the plan, at least. The Obama administration, however, has a different plan. In April, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Boeing, accusing it of opening the South Carolina plant to retaliate against the union, which has a history of striking at contract time. The N.L.R.B.’s proposed solution, believe it or not, is to move all the Dreamliner production back to Puget Sound, leaving those 5,000 workers in South Carolina twiddling their thumbs. Seriously, when has a government agency ever tried to dictate where a company makes its products? I can’t ever remember it happening. Neither can Boeing, which is fighting the complaint. J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel, has described the action as “unprecedented.” He has also said that it was a disservice to a country that is “in desperate need of economic growth and the concomitant job creation.” He’s right. That’s also why I’ve become mildly obsessed with the Boeing affair. Nothing matters more right now than job creation. Last week, President Obama barnstormed the Midwest, promising a jobs package in September and blaming Republicans for blocking job-creation efforts. Republicans, of course, have blamed the administration, complaining that regulatory overkill is keeping companies from creating jobs. They’re both right. Republicans won’t pass anything that might stimulate job growth because they are so ideologically opposed to federal spending. But the Democrats have blind spots, too. No, the Environmental Protection Agency shouldn’t be rolling back its rules, as the Republican presidential candidates seem to want. But a fair-minded person would have to acknowledge that the N.L.R.B.’s action is exactly the kind of overreach that should embarrass Democrats who claim to care about job creation. It’s paralyzing, is what it is. The law, to be sure, forbids a company from retaliating against a union. But the word “retaliation” suggests direct payback — a company shutting down a factory after a strike, for instance. Boeing did nothing like that. It not only hasn’t laid off a single worker in Washington State, it has added around 3,000 new ones. Seven out of every 10 Dreamliners will be assembled in Puget Sound. Before expanding to South Carolina, Boeing asked the union for a moratorium on strikes — precisely because it needed to get the airplane into the hands of impatient customers. The union said it would agree only if Boeing promised never to manufacture anywhere but Puget Sound. Boeing refused — as any company would. It is a mind-boggling stretch to describe Boeing’s strategy as “retaliation.” Companies have often moved to right-to-work states to avoid strikes; it is part of the calculus every big manufacturer makes. The South Carolina facility is a hedge against the possibility that Boeing’s union work force will shut down production of the Dreamliner. And it’s a perfectly legitimate hedge, at least under the rules that the business thought it was operating under. That is what is so jarring about this case — and not just for Boeing. Without any warning, the rules have changed. Uncertainty has replaced certainty. Other companies have to start wondering what other rules could soon change. It becomes a reason to hold back on hiring. When he was asked about the Boeing case earlier this summer, President Obama said that the N.L.R.B. is an independent agency and that his hands were tied. That may be true, though it’s worth pointing out that most of its top executives are his appointees. But when he gets back from vacation, he might do well looking at his own administration, instead of simply blaming the lack of jobs on the Republicans. As for the Republicans, there are plenty of regulations that would actually help create jobs — but which they won’t pass because of their own ideological blinders. I’ll be writing about that after Labor Day.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/global/2-asian-carriers-disclose-big-orders.html?ref=boeingcompany">2 Asian Carriers Disclose Big Orders<date>Published: August 10, 2011</date><text>HONG KONG — Two of the largest airlines in Asia, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines, announced aircraft orders worth billions of dollars Wednesday, in a sign that high oil prices and the recent market turmoil have not dented the willingness of Asian carriers to make sizable investments. Singapore Airlines said it had agreed to buy eight new Boeing aircraft, at a combined list price of $2.3 billion. Cathay Pacific, which is based in Hong Kong, said it was purchasing 12 aircraft, also from Boeing. That order is worth 25.6 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $3.28 billion, Cathay Pacific said — though it will obtain the aircraft at an undisclosed discount, a usual practice in the industry. The latest order means Cathay now has 97 aircraft on its books for delivery over the next few years. The announcements are the latest in a string of large aircraft orders in the Asia-Pacific region, where rising levels of affluence and buoyant economic growth are propping up demand. In June, AirAsia, a low-cost airline based in Malaysia, and IndiGo, an Indian low-cost carrier, announced some of the biggest aircraft orders the industry had ever seen, highlighting Asian carriers’ confidence that demand for service to and from Asia and within the sprawling region would soar in coming years. This is despite the fact that high fuel prices are once again weighing on the industry as a whole. Cathay Pacific cited higher fuel bills Wednesday as one of the main reasons that its first-half profits had declined sharply from those of a year earlier. The airline’s net profits for the first six months of 2011 totaled 2.8 billion dollars, 59 percent less than during the same period last year. Cathay’s fuel costs during the first half of 2011 increased almost 50 percent from last year. Had they remained at 2010 levels, Cathay’s operating profit for the first six months of 2011 would have equaled or even topped that of last year, Christopher Pratt, the Cathay chairman, said at a media briefing. Demand for premium-class travel remained strong, and despite the economic uncertainty in some of the world’s major economies “we have yet to see any drop-off in the front end,” Mr. Pratt said, referring to business and first-class bookings. Potentially more worrying, he said, was the cargo business, which was “appreciably weaker” in the second quarter of 2011 and which relies heavily on trade flows between Asia and Europe and the United States. A sustained downturn in demand “would put pressure on our freight business,” Mr. Pratt said. “After an exceptionally strong 2010, in which we made record profits, 2011 is proving to be more challenging,” Mr. Pratt said. “High fuel prices are increasing costs and recovering them through higher tariffs may affect demand. The outlook for the world economy is uncertain and a return to recessionary economic conditions would also affect demand and possibly average price levels.”</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/alan-mulally-ford-c-e-o-brings-the-focus-electric-to-late-night/?ref=boeingcompany">Alan Mulally, Ford C.E.O., Brings the Focus Electric to "Late Show"<date>August 4, 2011, 12:28 pm</date><text>John Paul Filo/CBSAlan Mulally on Wednesday during the taping of “The Late Show With David Letterman.” Alan Mulally, the Ford Motor Company president and chief executive, took his pitch for the electric car to late-night television just after midnight on Thursday, with an appearance on “The Late Show With David Letterman” on CBS. Introduced by his uncharacteristically effusive host as a “hero” and the man “responsible for rescuing the Ford Motor Company from the brink of bankruptcy,” Mr. Mulally took his seat with a smile and a wave to the audience and, beyond it, the country Mr. Mulally hoped to sell on the Focus Electric, a purely electric compact car due in showrooms in 2012. The conversation began in autobiographical cruise control, as the men swapped remembrances of early jobs bagging groceries and delivering newspapers. Mr. Mulally, at Mr. Letterman’s urging, then talked about his 37 years of experience in the aviation industry, specifically at Boeing. “Nearly 6 billion people have traveled on the 737,” said Mr. Letterman, to the applause of the audience. After a few minutes, the perfunctory give-and-take was steered not so deftly by Mr. Letterman into the car world. Mr. Mulally described the opportunity extended by William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker’s chairman, to lead Ford as his chance “to serve a second American global icon.” Mr. Letterman then pointed out that Ford weathered the global financial crisis without “government bailout money.” Cue a clapping audience and a beaming auto executive. “When I joined Ford five years ago, Dave, clearly we needed to move very quickly to a different strategy,” said Mr. Mulally. “We decided together to get focused on the Ford brand and divested all the other ones.” During Mr. Mulally’s tenure, Ford sold its Jaguar-Land Rover and Volvo divisions, closed its Mercury brand and significantly divested itself of its holdings in Mazda. Mr. Mulally sidestepped a question as to why other domestic automakers could not follow Ford’s example, before leading Mr. Letterman on a tour of the Focus Electric hatchback, which has a driving range of 80 miles, Mr. Mulally said. Sliding behind the wheel, Mr. Letterman drove the car from one side of the stage to the other. Mr. Mulally’s sales pitch was on target, but the shared moments of schtick were flat and felt scripted. The appearance felt like a car commercial, which is probably what it was meant to be.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/business/sales-gain-helps-boeing-beat-profit-forecasts.html?ref=boeingcompany">Sales Gain Helps Boeing Beat Profit Forecasts<date>Published: July 27, 2011</date><text>Boeing on Wednesday exceeded profit expectations for the second quarter as a result of more plane sales, a development that helped it raise its 2011 earnings guidance. The company said it remained on track to deliver its first 787 Dreamliner passenger jet and 747-8 air freighter in the third quarter. But Boeing, based in Chicago, also narrowed its delivery forecast for the new models. It now expects to deliver a total of 25 to 30 of them this year, compared with its previous expectation of 25 to 40. Still, that projection was trimmed less than many analysts had anticipated. And the increase in plane deliveries in the second quarter helped drive a rebound in that part of Boeing’s business, which had slipped behind its military work in total revenue and profit. W. James McNerney Jr., Boeing’s chief executive, told analysts that the company’s decision to install new engines on its single-aisle 737 jets, rather than build a new version of the plane, evolved over the last two to three months. The decision was unveiled in an unusual fashion last week, when American Airlines announced that it would split a $38 billion plane order between Boeing, its longtime supplier, and Airbus, Boeing’s European rival. Airbus announced several months ago that it would redesign its A320 models to accommodate more fuel-efficient engines. Boeing executives had said publicly that they were leaning toward building a new plane by 2020. But Mr. McNerney told the analysts on Wednesday that two things had changed in Boeing’s calculations. With Airbus quickly picking up orders for the plane with new engines, American and other airlines made it clear to Boeing that they would rather have “greater certainty in the midterm” on fuel savings than wait for “the more perfect solution,” Mr. McNerney said. He said that Boeing’s studies also showed that it would be riskier than previously expected to set up a production system for an entirely new plane, especially given that production rates have been surging for the single-aisle jets. Mr. McNerney said that Boeing believed that new engines would yield 10 to 12 percent in fuel savings on the 737s. Boeing officials said the changes could enable the 737 to retain what Boeing claims is an 8 percent advantage in total operating costs over the A320, even after that plane has new engines as well. Boeing has announced plans to expand 737 production to 42 planes a year by 2014. Mr. McNerney said that the order backlog was so substantial that Boeing was likely to increase that to 50 or 60 planes by the end of the decade. Boeing reported that its earnings increased 20 percent to $941 million, or $1.25 a share, from $787 million, or $1.06 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 6 percent to $16.5 billion from $15.6 billion. Analysts had expected Boeing to earn 97 cents a share. The company raised its earnings forecast for all of 2011 to $3.90 to $4.10 a share. Its earlier forecast was $3.80 to $4 a share. The company’s stock rose 47 cents to $70.63, on a day when the overall market was down sharply.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/business/global/american-places-record-order-with-2-jet-makers.html?ref=boeingcompany">American Orders 460 Narrow Jets from Boeing and Airbus<date>Published: July 20, 2011</date><text>PARIS — American Airlines announced on Wednesday a record order for 460 single-aisle planes from Airbus and Boeing in a deal worth more than $38 billion. The order breaks the longstanding monopoly that Boeing has had with the airline and forced a significant shift in the company’s strategy.American, based in Fort Worth, Tex., said that it planned to acquire 260 of the Airbus A320 aircraft and 200 Boeing 737s — half of which will be equipped with a new, more fuel-efficient engine. The move is a clear commitment by Boeing to revamp its best-selling 737 with new engines rather than develop an all-new version of the plane — a strategy that until now it had said most of its customers preferred. The deal, which American described as the largest commercial aircraft deal in history, also includes options and purchase rights for as many as 465 additional planes through 2025. The airline said Airbus and Boeing had provided a combined $13 billion in financing through lease transactions, which it said would fully cover the cost of the first 230 deliveries, set to begin in 2013. American said it expected to begin receiving its first Airbus and Boeing aircraft equipped with the more advanced engines starting in 2017. “Today’s announcement paves the way for us to achieve important milestones in our company’s future, giving us the ability to replace our narrow-body fleet and finance it responsibly,” said Gerard Arpey, the chairman and chief executive of American and its parent company, AMR. “With today’s news, we expect to have the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet among our peers in the U.S. industry within five years.” The order represents a coup for Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, which has not sold new planes to American in more than two decades. American retired its last Airbus jets — a handful of A300 widebodies — in 2009. “Not only have they sold jets to American, but they have forced Boeing’s hand into pushing for a re-engined 737,” said Saj Ahmad, an analyst at FBE Aerospace in London. Of the 260 Airbus jets on order, 130 will be for the A320neo, an upgraded version of its A320, which Airbus expects to bring to market beginning in 2016. Airbus has been promising fuel savings with the A320neo of as much as 15 percent over current engines. The new plane is also expected to run more quietly, cost less to operate and be able to fly farther or carry heavier loads while emitting less greenhouse gases. “This is significant for Airbus, but even more significant for Boeing,” said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners, a London brokerage. Boeing, he said, had been “chastened” by the market response to the A320neo, “which is making better headway than anyone had expected.” Mr. Ahmad of FBE Aerospace agreed. “Boeing has said for months it wouldn’t rush to a decision. But now that they have had to react to this deal, they, too, will capture new swathes of orders.” Airbus has said it expects to spend around $1.5 billion on the enhancements, and Boeing has placed the costs of fitting a new engine to the 737 within that range. Analysts had estimated that developing an all-new replacement for the 737 would probably have cost Boeing as much as $12 billion. The 737s and A320s, each of which typically seats 150 to 180 passengers, have formed the backbone of the air travel system for decades. More than 10,000 of them shuttle passengers between large airports. Boeing predicted last month that North American carriers would purchase more than 7,500 new airplanes between now and 2030, valued at $760 billion. Nearly three-quarters of those are expected to be single-aisle jets. Boeing currently holds a 51 percent share of the North American market, according to Ascend, an aviation consultancy based in London. As recently as last month, Boeing had appeared reluctant to commit to a significant redesign of the 737 as it faced delays with the 787 Dreamliner. The company, based in Chicago, indicated at the Paris Air Show in June that it did not expect to make a decision until the end of this year on whether to revamp the 737 with new engines or to develop an entirely new single-aisle jet for delivery around the beginning of the next decade. American trails Delta, United and Southwest among United States carriers in terms of number of passengers. The new orders will help American update a fleet of more than 600 planes which, with an average age of 15 years, is one of the oldest among the six top United States airlines. Its stable of single-aisle workhorses includes more than 200 McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s, which average more than 20 years of age and went out of production in 1999. Analysts noted that American’s move also places its competitors under pressure to update their fleets. Delta is also in talks with Boeing and Airbus and has said it aims to place an order by the end of the year. Southwest Airlines and United are also considering orders, according to industry executives. “If fuel stays high, and AMR can start pricing fares based on operating aircraft with new-generation engines, everyone might need to respond,” Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst for the Teal Group, wrote in a note to clients. Thomas Horton, AMR’s president, told analysts in a conference call that he expected the new aircraft would eventually reduce American’s overall fuel bill by 15 percent. The effect of fuel on AMR’s bottom line was clear in the company’s second-quarter results, which were also announced on Wednesday. American paid an average of $3.12 a gallon for jet fuel in the quarter, up 32 percent from an average of $2.37 a gallon in the period a year earlier — an increase of $524 million. That fuel bill increase more than offset a $440 million gain in revenue, to $6.1 billion. AMR reported a net loss of $286 million, compared with an $11 million loss a year earlier.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/business/global/thai-princes-plane-impounded-in-germany.html?ref=boeingcompany">Thai Prince's Plane Is Impounded in Germany<date>Published: July 13, 2011</date><text>A Boeing 737 used by the Thai crown prince has been impounded in Germany as part of a long-running commercial dispute, and the Thai government said Wednesday that it was seeking the jet’s release. Peter Prümm, a spokesman for the Munich Airport, said that the German federal authorities seized the plane there on Tuesday and that it remained parked at the airport. Werner Schneider, administrator for Walter Bau, a German construction company that declared bankruptcy in 2005, said by telephone that his office had requested the action in a lengthy contractual dispute over a Bangkok elevated highway project. Walter Bau was part of a consortium to design and build the Don Muang Tollway in the Thai capital. An international arbitration panel in July 2009 found the Thai government to have been in breach of its obligations to Walter Bau for, among other things, refusing to raise tolls on the road, as had been agreed in the contract. It ordered the Thai government to pay more than €30 million, or $42 million, in damages and legal costs. “This drastic measure is virtually the last resort,” Mr. Schneider said earlier in a news release. “The Thai government always stalled and did not respond to our demands.” Thai officials say the case is under appeal, but Mr. Schneider said the Thai government had made no effort to challenge the arbitrators’ ruling. Thani Thongphakdi, a spokesman for the Thai Foreign Ministry, confirmed that an aircraft had been impounded, but said it belonged to Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. The prince, who spends much of his time in Germany, is a trained pilot and flies the plane himself. “What transpired last night was the impounding of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince’s plane,” Mr. Thani said. “It’s a misunderstanding on the German side that his plane is the property of the Thai government, when in fact it is not. The plane belongs to His Royal Highness.” The Thai government has contacted the German authorities and “expressed concern,” Mr. Thani said. “We are working with them to rectify the situation.” “The case has yet to be finalized,” Mr. Thani said. “The legal procedures are still ongoing.” Mr. Prümm, the airport spokesman, said ownership of the plane was unclear after the legal action. John Reyels, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, said, “We regret the inconvenience caused to the Crown Prince,” adding, “But I cannot comment on the steps taken by the judicial authorities.” The plane, a 737-400 built in 1995, would most likely have a resale value of $5 million to $6 million, said Paul Hayes, head of insurance at Ascend, an aviation consulting firm in London. It is configured with 36 seats, he said, compared with the maximum 189 seats such jets have in commercial airline use. Walter Bau was one of the largest construction companies in Germany when it sought protection from creditors in February 2005, costing more than 4,000 workers their jobs. Mr. Schneider, the administrator, noted that in October 2005, he used the same tactic in Istanbul to impound an Airbus jet owned by Middle East Airlines in a dispute with the Lebanese government over debts owed to Walter Bau. David Jolly reported from Paris and Thomas Fuller from Bangkok. Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/business/04boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing’s Dreamliner Lands in Japan for Week of Tests<date>Published: July 3, 2011</date><text>TOKYO — Boeing’s long-delayed 787 completed its maiden trans-Pacific journey this weekend and landed in Japan, where the more fuel-efficient jet will undergo testing this week with All Nippon Airways in preparation for its first commercial use.The plane, called the Dreamliner, touched down at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport from Seattle early Sunday to applause and a white “Welcome to Japan” banner held by flight attendants and workers. Two fire trucks shot out celebratory arches of water as the aircraft approached the hangar. ANA even offered a live video feed of the landing on Ustream. As of Sunday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 37,000 times. The pilot Masayuki Ishii said he stayed calm during the flight but grew emotional upon landing and seeing the excitement on the ground. The 787’s much-anticipated arrival marks the near-end of a long wait by ANA, the first customer in line for the next-generation aircraft. Boeing missed the initial May 2008 delivery goal and has repeatedly delayed its introduction because of problems in development. The twin-engine jet is made mostly of carbon fiber and other composite materials instead of aluminum, making it lighter and 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other mid-sized airliners, according to Boeing. As airlines around the world grapple with rising fuel prices, demand is high for low-consumption planes. Boeing, based in Chicago, has taken orders for 835 of the Dreamliners, and hopes to deliver the first one to ANA in August or September. ANA has ordered 55 787s. Qantas and United Continental Holdings have each ordered 50, and Japan Airlines has ordered 35. Rival Airbus is expected to have its competitor to the 787, the A350, ready to enter service with Qatar Airways in 2013. Airbus has racked up nearly 600 orders for the new jetliner, which is also made mainly of carbon-fiber polymers. The test aircraft will fly several of ANA’s domestic routes out of Tokyo this week. Maintenance crews will also practice refueling, towing and other routine servicing operations. It is scheduled to depart for Seattle on Saturday, according to ANA.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/business/01boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Dispute Becomes Political Football in South Carolina<date>Published: June 30, 2011</date><text>NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Boeing’s gigantic new $750 million airplane factory here is the pride of South Carolina, the biggest single investment ever made in a state that is far more associated with old-line textile mills than state-of-the-art manufacturing. In just a few weeks, 1,000 workers will begin assembling the first of what they hope will be hundreds of 787 Dreamliners.That is, unless the federal government takes it all away. In a case that has enraged South Carolinians and become a cause célèbre among Republican lawmakers and presidential hopefuls, the National Labor Relations Board has accused Boeing of illegally setting up shop in South Carolina because of past strikes by the unionized workers at its main manufacturing base in the Seattle area. The board is asking a judge to order Boeing to move the Dreamliner production — and the associated jobs — to Washington State. Companies can generally move a plant anywhere they choose, although federal law bars them from doing so if a move involves punishing employees for exercising their federally protected right to unionize or strike. On several occasions, Boeing executives mentioned past strikes as a reason for the move to South Carolina — most directly, when one told the Seattle Times that the “overriding factor” in the decision was “we can’t afford to have a work stoppage every three years.” The unusual legal action, filed in April at the behest of Boeing’s principal union, has grown into a political conflagration, fanned by deep resentments between North and South, Democrats and Republicans, union and nonunion workers, and fans and foes of Big Government. Republican presidential candidates have denounced the case as a symbol of President Obama’s liberal agenda because he appointed the labor board’s top officials. This week, Mitt Romney called the labor board’s case a job killer. Newt Gingrich has proposed terminating the board’s funding, and Tim Pawlenty said the case evokes “the Soviet Union circa 1970s.” At a time of great economic anxiety, the case raises questions about the federal government’s role in promoting — or impeding — corporate investment and job creation. Facing so much heat, Mr. Obama said on Wednesday that he did not want to discuss details of the case because the N.L.R.B. was an independent agency. However, “as a general proposition, companies need to have the freedom to relocate,” he said. “We can’t afford to have labor and management fighting all the time, at a time when we’re competing against Germany and China and other countries that want to sell goods all around the world.” Business and government leaders in the South argue that the labor board is undermining Boeing’s competitive advantage, and they are particularly incensed that officials seem to be favoring unionized workers and plants. “This is a huge issue because economic development in the South has really been accelerated by the growth of nonunion plants,” said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University. “This case directly threatens the Southern model of economic development.” For South Carolina, the Boeing plant means far more than just the thousands of jobs it will create directly and indirectly. Boeing is a marquee company, and state leaders hope its presence will help erase South Carolina’s lingering image as an industrial backwater. “Boeing was a dream come true for South Carolina,” said Gov. Nikki R. Haley in an interview. “They came in and brought the hope of the American dream to this state to create real, good-quality jobs.” Those kinds of jobs are hard to come by in the Charleston area. “Everybody I talk to here is excited about this plant,” said one worker, Wayne Gravot. On a recent day at the plant, which is the size of 12 football fields, he and five co-workers were practicing drilling through carbon fiber — a lightweight composite material, as hard as metal, used for much of the Dreamliner’s body. “It’s a good job, a secure job,” said Mr. Gravot, 45, an Air Force veteran and father of two. Not long ago, he was laid off from a medical devices company and he does not want to end up unemployed again. The outcome of the case may not be certain for years, as it winds through N.L.R.B. proceedings and likely court appeals. If Boeing loses, it could be ordered to move its three-a-month Dreamliner assembly line from South Carolina to Washington State. As Ms. Haley and South Carolina’s members of Congress see it, federal bureaucrats have no right to snatch away the state’s prize or tell a global company where to locate a factory. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/business/global/24airshow.html?ref=boeingcompany">Airbus Adds $18 Billion Plane Order From AirAsia<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>LE BOURGET, France — Airbus capped off a frenetic week of new aircraft sales Thursday with a record-setting $18.2 billion order from AirAsia, the Malaysian low-cost airline.But before the ink had dried on what was the last of more than $72 billion in signed orders and commitments secured at the Paris Air Show this week, the head of Airbus warned that major investments would be required by aerospace suppliers worldwide to cope with the wave of aircraft deliveries that is expected to begin around 2015. “The huge challenge for us over the next four years will not be to sell new aircraft, but to be able to deliver them in high quantity,” Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, said in an interview. Tony F. Fernandes, the chief executive of AirAsia, flew to Paris overnight to announce an order for 200 of Airbus’s revamped A320 single-aisle jets, the A320neo. The order — which Airbus said was the largest civil aircraft order by number in history and the third-largest ever by market value for Airbus — was initially agreed to in February, but it was not completed until early Thursday morning. The AirAsia order came after an order for 72 A320neo jets from GoAir of India, bringing Airbus’s backlog for the plane to 1,029. The GoAir transaction, worth $16.6 billion at list prices, was for 150 A320neos and 30 classic A320s. “Travel is going to explode in our part of the world, and this is why we are doing this deal,” Mr. Fernandes said at the air show. He said that he expected to receive 12 to 18 of the planes each year beginning in 2016 and that they would be financed out of the airline’s cash flow rather than through borrowing. More than 90 percent of the 730 Airbus orders announced here this week were for the A320neo, a version of the company’s popular A320 narrow-body plane. Airbus is revamping the A320 with a more aerodynamic wing and new engines that promise a 15 percent reduction in fuel use over current A320 models. Neo stands for new engine option. Those orders come on top of an already significant order book for Airbus’s standard A320 planes, bringing the company’s total single-aisle-plane backlog to well over 3,000. Airbus already plans significant increases in the monthly production rates of all of its models, but the latest wave of orders puts particular pressure on its single-aisle assembly lines. Production of A320 family jets is set to rise to 38 a month in August and to 40 a month in the first quarter of next year from 36 a month now. It will step up to 42 a month by 2013. Mr. Enders said he would like to push those rates even higher, especially with the first A320neo deliveries looming for 2016. But he said one main constraint was the ability of aerospace suppliers to cope not only with Airbus’s surging demand but also with the more than 2,100 single-aisle 737 planes on the backlog at Boeing, Airbus’s American competitor. “We are not the only manufacturers in the world,” Mr. Enders said. “Right now, I don’t know where the limit is” in terms of production rates. Many of the companies that supply material to Airbus and Boeing, as well as to Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil, are eager to invest in new plants and equipment to meet the surge in business from plane makers, Mr. Enders said. But those companies — many of them small and privately owned — are struggling to raise the money to make those investments. “It’s becoming more and more of a concern,” Mr. Enders said. “Everybody wants a healthy industrial structure, but financing is becoming more and more difficult. The rates that banks are currently charging for loans to our suppliers are outrageous.” For now, there have been only isolated shortages of components. But analysts predicted that supply-chain concerns were likely to become a major topic of discussion soon. “We expect this to be an ongoing theme for the next two-plus years,” said Philip Toy, a commercial aerospace analyst at AlixPartners in Southfield, Mich. Airbus and Boeing together had $93 billion in new jet orders and commitments in Paris this year, more than double the $42 billion in deals struck at the last major international aviation bazaar, in Farnborough, England, in July 2010.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/business/global/23airshow.html?ref=boeingcompany">At Paris Air Show, an Affirmation for Bombardier<date>Published: June 22, 2011</date><text>LE BOURGET, FRANCE — The head of Bombardier’s civil aircraft division said Wednesday that the new orders received this week for its latest regional jet, the C-Series, demonstrated that the program would be economically viable. Gary R. Scott, president of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft, also dismissed speculation that the Canadian plane maker would be obliged to abandon the project because of lack of demand. “We are way beyond any uncertainty about the C-Series program,” Mr. Scott said during an interview at the Paris Air Show. His comments came as Airbus and Boeing announced signed orders and commitments for more than $36 billion worth of new jets on Wednesday, bringing the total haul for the world’s two largest jet makers nearly $80 billion in three days. Bombardier has announced two new deals for the 100-130 seat C-Series so far this week. On Tuesday, Korean Air said it had ordered 10 planes, worth more than $600 million, and also signed for 10 options and 10 purchase rights on the larger version, the C300. On Monday, Bombardier announced a 10-plane order from an unidentified “major network carrier.” Bombardier now has 123 orders from seven customers for the plane, which is expected to enter service in 2013. Airlines have also purchased a similar number of options, bringing the company’s expected order book for the C-Series to around 250 planes. Mr. Scott added that Bombardier was in discussions with a handful of other airlines and did not rule out the possibility of one more C-Series order during the air show, which ends on Sunday. Analysts have stressed the need for Bombardier to line up more customers to help share the risk as well as the development and capital costs for the plane, currently estimated at around $3.4 billion. Mr. Scott declined to say when he expected the program — which has received about one-third of its financing from the Canadian government — to be profitable. “We expect the C-Series will provide a good return to all of our stakeholders — government, suppliers and shareholders, and we are on track to do that,” Mr. Scott said. He predicted that the order backlog for the C-Series would be around 300 planes by the time it enters service in two years. Still, others note that regional jets have seen far more limited sales growth in recent years than larger single-aisle and wide-body jets, particularly as fuel prices have risen. Commercial jets with fewer than 150 seats are expected to make up just 6 percent of new aircraft sales over the next 20 years, equivalent to about $70 billion. That is down from around 14 percent of sales from 2000 to 2010. Mr. Scott dismissed repeated claims by Airbus that its A320neo — a revamped version of the fast-selling A320 with new, more fuel-efficient engines — had killed the business case for the C-Series. “Our aircraft is optimized for the 100-150 seat market, while the A320neo is optimized for 150 seats and above,” Mr. Scott said. Per seat, he argued, the C-Series would be 12 percent more fuel-efficient than the A319neo, the smallest version of Airbus’s neo series. Neo stands for new engine option. That said, Airbus was doing its best on Wednesday to tout the success of its revamped single-aisle jet, announcing more than 160 new A320neo orders and commitments. The total order book for the A320neo family now stands at more than 750 planes. Among those was a commitment from Republic Airways, a U.S. airline holding company, to buy 80 A320neo family aircraft for use by its Frontier Airlines subsidiary. The deal is valued at $7 billion at list prices, though such large transactions normally are made at deep discounts. The Colombian airline Avianca and LAN of Chile also ordered 33 and 20 A320neos, respectively. Aviation Lease and Finance Co. of Kuwait ordered 30 A320neo jets and six A350-900 wide-body jets, valued at $4.3 billion at list prices. The Indian budget carrier IndiGo on Wednesday formalized a record order for 180 Airbus single-aisle planes it announced in January. The deal, worth $16.6 billion at list prices, is for 150 A320neos and 30 classic A320s. It is the largest single order by number of aircraft in commercial aviation history. Boeing, meanwhile, announced a large commitment for single-aisle planes from UTair Aviation of Russia. The carrier, based in Tyumen, Siberia, agreed to buy 40 next-generation Boeing 737 planes, including seven 737-900ERs and 33 737-800s, a deal worth $3.3 billion. That deal was the largest announced so far at the air show for the 737, Boeing’s biggest-selling jet, with a backlog of more than 2,100 planes. Boeing is considering whether to follow Airbus’s lead and offer a version of that plane with a more fuel-efficient engine or to develop a new single-aisle jet for entry into service around 2020.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/business/global/22iht-airshow22.html?ref=boeingcompany">Airbus Beats Forecast for Revamped A320 Orders<date>Published: June 21, 2011</date><text>LE BOURGET, FRANCE — Airbus raked in more orders for its revamped A320 single-aisle plane on Tuesday, tapping into growing demand for more fuel-efficient planes from leasing companies and fast-growing low-cost carriers, particularly in Asia.The European plane maker announced commitments for more than 100 more A320neo jets at the Paris Air Show here, bringing the total backlog for the plane, which has been on offer since December, to nearly 600 aircraft — well beyond the 500-order benchmark that Airbus had initially predicted it would achieve by the end of the show. Neo stands for New Engine Option. The momentum building for the 150 to 180 seat plane, which is being equipped with new engines that are 15 percent more fuel efficient than current models, is likely to put pressure on Boeing to make a decision on whether to follow suit with an enhanced version of its competing 737 jet, or to develop an entirely new narrow-bodied jet for delivery at the beginning of the next decade. “It prompts Boeing to do something,” Henri Courpron, chief executive of International Finance Lease Corp., told Reuters. “It cannot do nothing.” Boeing executives have said they expect to decide on the company’s future single-aisle strategy by the end of this year. Airbus chalked up $11 billion in new jet orders and commitments on Tuesday, bringing its total haul for the first two days of the show to more than $26 billion. Boeing received new orders worth $4.7 billion, bringing its two-day total to nearly $16 billion. The U.S. plane maker also disclosed the buyers of planes worth several billion dollars more, which it had previously attributed to unidentified customers. CIT Aerospace, another leasing company, committed Tuesday to purchase 50 A320neos for delivery from 2016 to 2019. That commitment is valued at $4.6 billion at list prices. JetBlue Airways, the U.S. low-cost carrier, announced its first purchase of A320neos, committing to order 40 of the revamped single-aisle planes for delivery from 2017 to 2021. The carrier, which is the world’s largest A320 operator with a fleet of 119 of the planes, also said it would convert 30 existing orders for classic A320s into the stretched A321 version, which will be delivered starting in 2013. Elsewhere, Garuda Indonesia said it would buy 10 A320neo jets in addition to 15 classic A320s for its domestic low-cost subsidiary, Citylink, in a deal worth a combined $2.2 billion. Garuda, the Indonesian flag carrier, said the new aircraft would eventually replace Boeing 737s in Citylink’s fleet, though Garuda itself would continue to fly them. TransAsia Airways of Taiwan ordered six A321neos, valued at $635 million at list prices. “Passenger growth is a function of economic growth, and Asia-Pacific is where the growth is right now,” said Emirsyah Satar, the Garuda chief executive. He said air passenger traffic at Garuda had been growing at a “double-digit” pace for the past several years. Air passenger traffic within the Asia-Pacific region is expected to expand at an average annual pace of around 7 percent over the next two decades, according to a long-term forecast published last week by Boeing. That compares with forecasts for annual traffic increases of just 2.3 percent in North America and 4 percent in Europe. Asia-Pacific carriers are expected to receive more than one-third of all new aircraft deliveries between now and 2030, representing $1.5 trillion in sales. Boeing announced new orders on Tuesday for a further 25 of its single-aisle 737-800 jets, valued at around $2 billion at list prices. Norwegian Air Shuttle, a low-cost carrier based in Oslo, ordered 15 of the planes while Malaysia Airlines said it had exercised an option to purchase 10, bringing its total 737-800 orders to 45. The Malaysian order had been previously attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing’s order book. Norwegian Air Shuttle also finalized a contract for three 787 widebody jets, worth $650 million. Boeing also announced a number of widebody orders from GE Capital Aviation Services, the aircraft-leasing arm of General Electric. The lessor, known as GECAS, said it would buy eight long-range 777-300ER jets and two freighter versions of the stretched 747-8, which is making its debut at the Paris show. The value of that order was not disclosed, but would be worth $2.9 billion at list prices. Boeing also disclosed that the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot was the buyer earlier this year of eight 777-300ER jets, valued at $2.3 billion, which the plane maker had previously attributed to an unidentified customer. Elsewhere, Bombardier of Canada announced its second order in as many days for its forthcoming C-Series regional jet. The firm order for 10 planes, worth more than $600 million, came from Korean Air, which also signed for 10 options and 10 purchase rights on the 130-seat version of the plane, the C300. Bombardier on Monday announced a 10-plane order from an unidentified “major network carrier.” Bombardier now has 123 firm orders from seven customers for the plane, which is expected to enter service in 2013.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/business/global/21iht-RAV-OUTLOOK21.html?ref=boeingcompany">Aircraft Makers Not Put Off by Excess Capacity<date>Published: June 20, 2011</date><text>PARIS — At its annual general meeting this month in Singapore, the International Air Transport Association lowered its forecast for profits this year of its member airlines by more than 50 percent, to $4 billion from $8.6 billion predicted as recently as March 2.Although it raised its estimate for earnings last year to $18 billion from an earlier estimate of $16 billion, the forecast of an even steeper than expected fall in airline profitability makes a gloomy backdrop for the 49th Paris air show at Le Bourget airfield this week. The carriers are being squeezed between high oil prices — expected to average $110 per barrel this year, against $96 in 2010 — and an overly rapid expansion of capacity relative to demand. Global airline capacity this year is slated to rise by 5.8 percent, while demand is expected to expand by only 4.7 percent. “But with a dismal 0.7 percent margin, there is little buffer left against further shocks,” I.A.T.A.’s director general, Giovanni Bisignani, said at the annual meeting, referring to the $4 billion profit on projected revenue of $598 billion. In the U.S. market in particular, unemployment data and consumer sentiment indicators suggest that a bigger buffer might be welcome. Positioning themselves for a slackening market, JetBlue and AirTran airways, focused on budget-sensitive personal travel, have already announced promotional low-fare programs for the September post-holiday season, offers not usually made until late July or early August, according to Helane Becker, airline analyst at the investment bank Dahlman Rose. Yet even as airlines face the prospect of excess capacity, Airbus and Boeing say they are increasing production of their A320 and 737 airliners to meet an expected wave of new orders. Boeing is also stepping up production of its wide-bodied 777. Even taking into account strong growth in emerging markets and the attraction for the carriers of fuel-efficient offerings such as the A320 New Engine Option or Bombardier’s C Series — which has just notched up its 100th order — are the manufacturers at risk of getting out of sync with the economic cycle? Michael J. Richter, co-head of aerospace business at the investment bank Lazard in Los Angeles, says he takes a relatively optimistic view of the outlook for the manufacturers. “The aerospace industry is in a better position than last year at the time of Farnborough,” Mr. Richter said, referring to the British air show that alternates annually with Le Bourget. “Paris this year should be a vibrant deal-making environment.” Mergers and acquisitions business has been fairly active this year and is likely to continue, reflecting a greater availability of financing, he said. “While the aerospace industry remains vulnerable to economic cycles, there are numerous hot spots globally at present.” While “ultimately, consumer demand drives air traffic,” Mr. Richter said, “Asia-Pacific retains bright prospects, although the Japanese earthquake/tsunami/nuclear meltdown has naturally caused problems and disruptions. Private equity has re-emerged in the aerospace industry to finance strategic acquisitions, while buyers already in aerospace are executing fill-in purchases to cover gaps in their structures or product lines.” Lazard’s forecasts show commercial aircraft production rising this year over 2010 and rising again in 2012, then holding steady into 2013. James F. Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit, said his company would raise the production rate of the 737 model to 35 aircraft per month from 31.5 early next year, to 38 in the second quarter of 2013 and finally to 42 in the first half of 2014, to service a backlog of 2,100 orders. Together with increases of the much larger 777 family, Boeing is raising its overall aircraft output rate by 40 percent in the next three years. Airbus similarly announced in May it was stepping up production of its A320 family. Looking ahead over the next 20 years, Mr. Albaugh forecast global demand for 33,500 new commercial aircraft, worth nearly $4 trillion, of which $1.7 trillion worth would be in the 100- to 200-passenger 737/A320 size range. “Now is the time for us to commit to a new program,” Mr. Albaugh said. “We are leaning toward the New Small Airplane, to be in service by 2019 or 2020 with 20 percent better fuel efficiency than today’s 737.” Alternatively, the current model 737 could be re-engined. A decision between the two options should come this year. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/business/global/18airshow.html?ref=boeingcompany">At Paris Air Show, Strong Sales Are Expected<date>Published: June 17, 2011</date><text>PARIS — Their corporate chalets may be a touch less spacious and their delegations less numerous, but the titans of the global aerospace industry are returning to Paris this year for what most aviation executives expect will be an affirmation of a steady recovery that is likely to translate into a flurry of orders for newer and more fuel-efficient jets.The organizers of the Paris Air Show, which opens on Monday at Le Bourget airport, north of the capital, said that most major exhibitors had reduced their budgets for the weeklong trade show by 10 to 30 percent from the levels of 2009, the last time the industry gathered here. Still, the number of exhibitors was expected to reach a record, 2,100 — many of them subcontractors and suppliers to companies like Boeing and Airbus — from 80 countries. Louis Gallois, the chief executive of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent company of Airbus, said he expected a lively week. “The market is dynamic and definitely on the right track,” Mr. Gallois said during a recent interview. “Traffic is good and airlines are in a better financial situation.” The global airline industry made a net profit of $18 billion in 2010, bouncing back from combined losses of nearly $26 billion in 2008 and 2009. The airlines are expected to be profitable again this year, to the tune of about $4 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association. Despite the recent jump in oil prices and turmoil in Japan, North Africa and the Middle East, air passenger and cargo demand are expected to increase 4.4 and 5.5 percent, respectively, this year, largely in line with long-term trends. “The downturn in commercial orders was short-lived,” said Philip Toy, a commercial aerospace analyst at AlixPartners in Southfield, Mich. He, too, forecast the signing of a number of new contracts in coming days, particularly for the newest version of Airbus’s popular A320 single-aisle jet, which will be fitted with more fuel-efficient engines and a more aerodynamic wing. The A320neo — the letters stand for new engine option — will be available for delivery beginning in 2016, and Airbus has been promising fuel savings of as much as 15 percent over current engines. It is expected also to run more quietly, with lower operating costs, and be able to fly farther or carry heavier payloads while emitting less greenhouse gas. Airbus has booked more than 200 firm orders for the A320neo since it was introduced late last year, with commitments from customers to buy as many as 200 more. Analysts said the momentum building behind the A320neo was putting pressure on Boeing, the American plane maker, to follow suit with a revamped version of its 737, rather than produce a fully redesigned single-aisle jet. After more than 18 months of deliberation, Boeing has yet to decide which strategy to pursue. Boeing has indicated that an announcement is unlikely at Le Bourget. “They need to make an announcement very soon, before the end of this calendar year,” or risk losing customers to Airbus, Mr. Toy said. “Airbus is no doubt anxious to increase the noise about Boeing’s indecision.” Randy Tinseth, vice president for marketing at Boeing, said that the manufacturer continued to lean toward an all-new 737 replacement jet that would enter the market in 2019 or 2020 — an approach he said was preferred by customers. But Boeing was not ruling out a new engine, which he said would be 11 percent more fuel-efficient than those on existing models. “We are going to take our time,” Mr. Tinseth said. “When the decision is ready to be made, we will make it.” Meanwhile, Airbus also plans to give an update on the development of its latest plane, the A350-XWB, which is slated for delivery in late 2013. The assembly of the first test aircraft is expected to begin at the end of this year, with flight tests scheduled for 2012. Analysts said Boeing probably would seek to focus attention during the show on its newest twin-aisle jets: the 787 Dreamliner, its competitor to the A350; and the 747-8, a stretched version of the 747. Both the Dreamliner and the 747-8 will be on display at Le Bourget this year for the first time. “Boeing will quietly take their blows on the narrow-body front while playing up” its wide-body offerings, said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aerospace and defense consulting group in Fairfax, Va. After nearly three years of production delays, Boeing plans to deliver its first 787 — 52 percent of which is made from lightweight composite materials rather than metal — to All Nippon Airways in late July or early August. Meanwhile, delivery of the first freighter version of the 747-8, to Cargolux of Luxembourg, is also expected this summer. Lufthansa will be the first airline to receive the passenger version of the plane, which can seat as many as 500 people, in early 2012. At the smaller end of the spectrum, analysts said they would be watching closely to see how many orders the makers of regional jets, which typically seat 100 to 200 passengers, would manage to garner at the show. Despite relatively weak demand, the sector has become increasingly crowded in recent years, with manufacturers from Brazil, Canada, China, Japan and Russia. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/business/global/17boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Raises Forecast for Sales by 8.5%<date>Published: June 16, 2011</date><text>Boeing on Thursday raised its long-range forecast for commercial aircraft demand, citing expectations that annual increases in passenger and cargo traffic, particularly in Asia, would continue to outpace average global economic growth over the next two decades.The plane maker predicted that airlines would buy 33,500 new jets through 2030. That represented an increase of 8.5 percent from its previous forecast of 30,900 planes, made last July as airlines were just beginning to emerge from a downturn set off by the 2008-9 financial crisis. Boeing, based in Chicago, said that the new orders would be worth $4 trillion, up 11 percent from the $3.6 trillion forecast a year ago. “Not only is there a strong demand for air travel and new airplanes today,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president for marketing at Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, “but the fundamental drivers of air travel — including economic growth, world trade and liberalization — all point to a healthy long-term demand.” The 20-year forecast from Boeing was announced in advance of the Paris Air Show, which opens Monday at Le Bourget Airport. Airbus in December predicted sales of 26,000 commercial planes through the end of 2029, with a market value of $3.2 trillion. The International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva, predicted this month that carriers would report a collective profit of about $4 billion this year after recording a $18 billion profit in 2010. The industry lost a combined $26 billion in the 2008-9 period. Boeing predicted that global gross domestic product growth would average about 3.3 percent a year over the next 20 years, with the economies of China and India each expected to expand by about 7 percent annually. Global air traffic was likely to continue growing at an average yearly rate of just over 5 percent. Within the Asia-Pacific region, air traffic was likely to grow by an average of 7 percent a year, Boeing said, compared with just 2.3 percent annual growth within North America and 4 percent in Europe. “We expect passenger traffic to almost triple over the next 20 years, while cargo will more than triple,” Mr. Tinseth said. The majority of new aircraft sales — about 70 percent — would be of single-aisle planes like the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, which normally seat about 150 to 200 passengers, Boeing said. Twin-aisle wide bodies like Airbus’s planned A350-XWB and the coming Boeing 787 Dreamliner would represent about 22 percent. The single-aisle segment is the most hotly contested for both Boeing and Airbus, which each claim about 50 percent of the market. But the two companies are expected to begin to face competition at the beginning of the next decade when other manufacturers — including Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil — are expected to start deliveries of jets that can seat similar numbers of passengers.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/business/14boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Labor Battle Is Poised to Go Before Judge<date>Published: June 13, 2011</date><text>Barring a last-minute settlement, lawyers for the National Labor Relations Board will begin arguing before a Seattle judge on Tuesday that Boeing broke the law by building a new, nonunion production line in South Carolina instead of expanding its unionized operations in Washington State.Boeing, the N.L.R.B. and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local that initiated the case all still say they would like to find a way to settle. Appeals could grind on for years, clouding the future of Boeing’s $750 million Dreamliner assembly plant scheduled to start production in July in North Charleston, S.C. Negotiators and outside analysts said that any deal would most likely require Boeing to commit to adding some level of new production lines to its Puget Sound manufacturing hub in exchange for certain union concessions, like a no-strike pledge. The labor board’s top lawyer says Boeing’s decision to move the operation to South Carolina constituted illegal retaliation against Boeing’s unionized workers in Washington for engaging in their legally protected right to strike, including a 58-day walkout in 2008. Boeing has acknowledged that the fear of labor disruptions factored into its thinking, but it said the main reason for moving the line was South Carolina’s lower production costs. Starting pay at the South Carolina plant is $14 an hour, while starting pay in Washington is $15 an hour, rising to an average of $28 an hour. The case has stirred a political firestorm. Republicans have joined business leaders in accusing the labor board of trying to sabotage right-to-work states as well as the fundamental right of corporate managers to decide how and where to run their businesses. South Carolina’s governor, Nikki R. Haley, wants to make the dispute an issue in the presidential campaign, while Congressional Republicans have threatened to cut the labor board’s financing and have urged President Obama to withdraw the nomination of Lafe Solomon, the board’s acting general counsel, who brought the Boeing case. “It is absurd, in this country that represents free enterprise, that one unaccountable, unelected, unconfirmed acting general counsel can threaten thousands of jobs,” said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina. “This is something you would expect in a third world country.” Although the president appoints the board’s top officials, the agency operates independently. Several Republicans have accused President Obama of carrying water for organized labor by having the board bring the case. Mr. Solomon and Obama administration officials say the White House has had nothing to do with the dispute. The White House has been largely silent about the case, although numerous Congressional Democrats have assailed Republicans for attacking an agency that they say is merely enforcing the law and protecting workers’ right to strike. Mr. Solomon brought the case after the machinists’ union filed a complaint, arguing that the South Carolina plan was illegally taking jobs from Washington State. As a remedy, he wants Boeing to move the 1,000-employee production line, which will initially build three planes a month, to Washington. Mr. Solomon said in an interview that he spent three months in settlement talks with both sides before the board filed the case, and that contacts continue intermittently. “Nothing would make me happier than to reach a settlement,” he said. In a speech last week at a conference at the New York University School of Law, he added: “I felt and still feel these parties have a longstanding relationship with each other. They have a deep past together and have a deep future together, and it would be advantageous to all if a settlement could be worked out.” Many legal specialists say the N.L.R.B. and the machinists’ union have a good chance of winning before the administrative law judge in Seattle and in the next stage of the legal process, an appeal to the Democrat-dominated, five-seat labor board in the District of Columbia. The case before the law judge is expected to last weeks as the board and Boeing spar over which documents to turn over to the other side. Boeing and some legal specialists say the company is likely to win in the federal circuit court that would hear appeals after that. But no one wants the case to drag on for years. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/business/global/19wto.html?ref=boeingcompany">W.T.O. Ruling on Airbus Subsidies Upheld on Appeal<date>Published: May 18, 2011</date><text>A World Trade Organization appeals panel on Wednesday upheld a ruling that Boeing lost market share to its European rival, Airbus, as a result of billions of dollars in low-cost government loans, according to European and American officials.But the panel rejected claims by the United States that state financing for the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet was automatically prohibited under global trade rules, the officials said. Appeals judges at the trade body, which is based in Geneva, concurred with the initial finding that loans extended to Airbus over the course of four decades did constitute unfair subsidies that had caused Boeing to lose aircraft sales. But the ruling also appeared to upend what the Americans had considered one of the most crucial parts of the landmark case: namely, that the loans — known as launch aid — that Airbus received from Germany, Spain and Britain for the twin-deck A380 jets were expressly prohibited because governments expected a significant export market for the planes when they granted the support. The W.T.O. defines two broad categories of subsidies: those that are “prohibited” and those that are “actionable” — that is, subject to legal challenge or to countervailing measures like punitive tariffs. Prohibited subsidies are those that are specifically designed to promote exports or to encourage production using domestically made components. Under W.T.O. rules, any prohibited subsidy must be withdrawn within 90 days of the adoption of a dispute panel’s findings. Actionable subsidies are not prohibited automatically, but they can be challenged if the complaining country shows that the subsidy caused material injury — a loss of jobs, profit or production capacity — or “adverse effects” to its industry, like a loss of export market share or sales. The appellate ruling on Wednesday did not find European launch aid loans for the A380 to be prohibited. But it did find many of them to be actionable, which will require European governments to propose some form of remedy in the coming months to offset the benefit of any outstanding subsidies, trade lawyers said. Proving that the loans were export subsidies was seen as critical to the United States and Boeing, which have sought to thwart European plans to finance Airbus’s coming wide-body jet, the A350-XWB, using the same type of financing mechanism. The A350 is expected to enter commercial service in 2013 and is seen as the biggest challenger to Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, scheduled to be delivered to its first customers this year. Dating to 2005, the United States complaint against the European Union forms the first part of the most complex and voluminous case ever to have been brought before the global trade body. The original ruling last year ran more than 1,000 pages, and the appellate body’s report is more than 600 pages. A separate 850-page ruling by the W.T.O. in April found that Boeing had received at least $5.3 billion in improper United States government subsidies to develop the 787 and other jet models, giving it an unfair advantage over Airbus. That ruling has also been appealed. Both sides were quick to claim victory on Wednesday. “The U.S. central claim that Airbus received prohibited export subsidies has been dismissed in its entirety,” Karel De Gucht, the European trade commissioner, said in a statement. “I am particularly pleased with this important result.” European officials pointed to the appellate panel’s finding that the initial panel erred in its interpretation, saying that the United States had failed to demonstrate that European governments had granted loans to the A380 program specifically because they expected the planes to be sold overseas. The United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, asserted that the ruling affirmed Washington’s contention that European government loans — which he said totaled $18 billion over 40 years — had been used to support the development of every Airbus model ever produced and helped Airbus vault past Boeing in 2003 to become the world’s largest plane maker. “These subsidies have greatly harmed the United States, causing Boeing to lose sales and market share in key markets throughout the world,” Mr. Kirk said in a statement. 1 2 Next Page » Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/global/29india.html?ref=boeingcompany">India Rejects U.S. Bids for Big Order of Fighter Jets<date>Published: April 28, 2011</date><text>NEW DELHI — The United States lost a hard-fought competition to supply a new generation of fighter jets to India, which has listed two European manufacturers as the finalists for an order estimated to be worth $10 billion.The decision was a blow for President Obama, who had pushed hard for this and other defense deals during his visit to India in November as part of his agenda to deepen and broaden the United States’ relationship with India. The American ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer, who separately announced on Thursday that he would resign from his post for personal reasons, said the United States was “deeply disappointed by this news.” While political and economic relations between India and the United States have been warming for years, American arms makers have struggled to win big contracts here. After decades of frosty relations during the cold war, which pushed India to rely extensively on the Soviet Union for military hardware, many in the Indian defense establishment are still wary of American intentions and United States military aid to Pakistan, India’s main adversary. The American bid to build the fighters came from Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Boeing had offered its F/A -18 jets, and Lockheed Martin pitched its F-16 planes. But India instead narrowed the list to the Rafale fighter from Dassault and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet made by a consortium of European companies. Russian and Swedish bids were also turned down. The 126 planes are meant to replace aging Russian jets. A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said the country hoped to make a final decision by the end of March 2012. Both American companies are also looking to sell other military hardware to India, which unlike much of the Western world has been sharply increasing its defense spending. Some analysts say India could spend $50 billion to $80 billion on equipment in the next five years. One Indian international affairs analyst, C. Raja Mohan, played down the significance of the American companies’ loss of this deal. He said that the Indian government was buying more from United States contractors than ever before. “One deal doesn’t make everything,” said Mr. Mohan, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. “There has been a lot of hype about this deal. We are doing things with the U.S. that we never did before.” But another analyst, Nitin Pai, argued that India’s decision would hurt relations with the United States, at a time when the country needed stronger ties with America to advance its interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the United Nations Security Council, on which India is seeking a permanent seat. “This move will most certainly reduce India’s geopolitical leverage with the U.S. military-industrial complex, at a time when India needs it most,” Mr. Pai wrote on his blog, The Acorn. He added, “Is the United States more likely to be sympathetic to India’s interests after an $11 billion contract — which means much needed jobs for the U.S. economy — is awarded to someone else?” Dinesh Keskar, president of Boeing’s Indian operation, said that while the company was “obviously disappointed” about not making the cut for the fighter jets, it was “quite excited about the opportunities in India.” He added that the company was seeking a meeting with Indian officials to find out why its planes were not selected. Boeing said the company and the Indian Air Force were in the final stages of negotiating a contract for C-17 cargo planes that was announced by Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November. And it is hoping to win orders for attack and heavy-lift helicopters. “We are quite engaged with and will continue our partnership with India,” Mr. Keskar said in a telephone interview.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/business/28boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Chief Says Rivet Flaws Appear Limited to One Jet<date>Published: April 27, 2011</date><text>The riveting flaws in the roof of the Southwest Airlines jet that recently tore open in flight appear to be poor manufacturing work on that one plane rather than a broader design failure, Boeing’s chief executive said Wednesday.The executive, W. James McNerney, told analysts that preliminary data “points more in that direction.” The National Transportation Safety Board issued an interim report on Monday, saying that a laboratory examination of intact sections of the roof found that rivet holes on one layer of the plane’s skin did not line up properly with an underlying layer. A five-foot hole suddenly ripped open in the cabin roof on April 1, forcing the Southwest jet to make an emergency landing in Arizona. The safety board did not draw any conclusions about the cause of the rupture, which occurred at 34,000 feet. Independent experts said they were surprised that Boeing’s inspectors had not caught such a basic mistake when the plane was built in the mid-1990s. Mr. McNerney said federal investigators were still sorting out what happened. His comments came as Boeing announced that its first-quarter earnings rose 13 percent to $586 million, or 78 cents a share, from $519 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 2 percent to $14.9 billion, from $15.2 billion, on weaker revenue in the commercial airplane business. The company, which also has a large military business, reaffirmed its guidance for the year, with revenue expected to be $68 billion to $71 billion and earnings to be $3.80 to $4 a share. Mr. McNerney said that Boeing remained on track to make the first deliveries of its new 747-8 freighter and its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner passenger plane, and that it still expected to deliver 25 to 40 of these two models this year. He said the 787 deliveries would include a mix of the first planes it has built, which have needed extensive reworking to fix poorly made parts from suppliers, and the latest jets, which are coming off the production line in much better shape. The 787, built with lightweight composite materials to lower fuel costs, has attracted more sales — about 850 — than any commercial plane in history. But the production problems have added billions of dollars in costs, and Mr. McNerney said the project’s profitability would eventually be decided by how well longer-range versions of the plane sell. Mr. McNerney also said that Airbus’s plan to update its A320 series with new engines was taking sales from smaller competitors, like Canada’s Bombardier, rather than from Boeing. He said Boeing was still likely to forgo changing the engines on its 737 models and seek to introduce a new plane by 2019 or 2020.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/opinion/26tue2.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing and the N.L.R.B.<date>Published: April 25, 2011</date><text>It may be a difficult case to prove, but the complaint filed last month by the National Labor Relations Board against Boeing is a welcome effort to defend workers’ right to collective bargaining. The N.L.R.B. is accusing the company of setting up a nonunion production line in South Carolina to retaliate against unionized workers in Washington State for striking. The board wants to force Boeing to make all of its new Dreamliner jets in Washington, rather than make 30 percent of them at the new line in Charleston. The case hinges on proving Boeing’s intent. It is illegal to retaliate against workers for striking — there have been four strikes at the Washington facility since 1989 — or threaten workers in order to discourage strikes. But the company can decide to locate production in South Carolina because it makes business sense and may include “production stability” as a factor in its decision. Boeing says it wants to diversify its assembly to make it less vulnerable to disruptions caused by potential future strikes. Further complicating the N.L.R.B.’s case, Boeing says opening the line in South Carolina will not lead to layoffs in Washington, where it is adding jobs, too. The N.L.R.B.’s action lands squarely on an ambiguity in the nation’s labor protections — which enshrine the right to collective bargaining yet allow companies ways to avoid it by going to another state. Today, 1 out of 13 private sector workers is in a union, down from about 1 in 4 in the early 1970s. Many forces are contributing to this erosion, including globalization and the decline of manufacturing. But one important force is the flight of companies to “right-to-work” states where workers cannot be required to join a union. Currently, unionized workers nationally make 19 percent more than nonunion workers, on average. The N.L.R.B.’s case rests on statements by Boeing officials that, it believes, prove retaliation. One Boeing executive told The Seattle Times that the main reason to put the new line in South Carolina was “that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.” A hearing before an administrative law judge is scheduled for June. The judge’s decision can be appealed to the full board, and the board’s decision can be appealed in federal court. If the N.L.R.B.’s position is upheld, this case could draw some clearer lines on what businesses can and cannot do to avoid dealing with unions. At the very least, this case will shed light on the business strategies employed by a powerful company to resist unionization.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/business/26air.html?ref=boeingcompany">Rivet Manufacturing Flaw Suspected in Jet’s Roof<date>Published: April 25, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Federal investigators said Monday that they had discovered flaws in the riveting of the roof of the Southwest Airlines plane that tore open in flight on April 1, a finding that experts said probably showed manufacturing defects.The National Transportation Safety Board, in an interim report, said that a laboratory examination of intact sections of the roof found that rivet holes on one layer of the plane’s skin did not line up properly with an underlying layer. The board also said that it found paint from the exterior of the plane had bled through into the inside. Experts said that suggested the aluminum skin had not been properly bound together, leading to premature damage from fatigue. The board, as is its practice, did not draw any conclusions about the cause of the rupture, which occurred at 34,000 feet. It will not do so until research is complete and its five members receive a report from the staff, something that will probably not happen for months. But outside experts said that the 15-year-old Boeing 737 probably left the factory with flaws. “It means the assembly was wrong, it means the wrong tools were used, it means they were careless in drilling the holes, and maybe the drill was dull,” said John J. Goglia, an aircraft maintenance expert who is a former member of the safety board. Robert W. Mann Jr., an aviation industry expert in Port Washington, N.Y., said such flaws were unusual. “The key issue is whether this was systemic,” he said. “ Why weren’t the parts rejected?” Boeing, in a statement, said it would not speculate about the cause of the incident but that “we remain fully engaged with the investigation.” The safety board said it was also examining the five other Southwest planes that were found to have cracks. Those five planes and the one that ripped open all had about 40,000 cycles of takeoffs and landings. After the Southwest incident, Boeing said it did not expect that these models of 737s needed to be inspected before at least 60,000 cycles. In an emergency order days after the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines flying those planes to check for cracks at 30,000 cycles. The six planes were delivered by Boeing from 1994 to 1996. Boeing said it had completed a worldwide inspection of nearly 80 percent of 190 similar 737s and found no other problems. An F.A.A. official involved in the investigation, who asked not to be identified because the agency had not taken a formal position, said it was too soon to know whether the agency’s inspection order would have detected bad riveting. But the official added that the results of that inspection did not show that there was any generic problem. In fact, it was possible that the Southwest airplane had a one-of-a-kind problem, the official said. If the rivet holes on the two pieces of aluminum being fastened together did not line up right, that would mean they were egg-shaped instead of round, Mr. Goglia said. As the two pieces of metal were pulled in opposite directions when a plane is pressurized and depressurized, round holes would spread the forces evenly around the circumference of the hole. But if the hole is egg-shaped, he said, “they’re concentrated in one spot.” The aviation industry is well acquainted with cracks developing around rivets as airplanes age. In April 1988, an Aloha Airlines plane peeled open almost like a sardine can, resulting in new inspection requirements. But that plane had 89,000 takeoffs and landings. Hans J. Weber, owner of Tecop International, an aviation consulting firm in San Diego, said that manufacturing flaws were rare. “This is a real puzzle,” he said. “I am not fully satisfied with the explanation. The manufacturing of aluminum airplanes is very well understood.” Mr. Mann said he was concerned about the paint. “These are not small defects that you could have wicking of the liquids,” Mr. Mann said. “Paint is not a thin substance. It is pretty substantial.” If the parts were not the perfect shape as they came to the manufacturing plant, “that creates the necessity to redrill, which creates the ovalization,” Mr. Mann said, leading the parts to wear. Analysts pointed out that there had been several problems in 1990s with planes that had been miswired or misassembled. With major manufacturers like Boeing, the F.A.A. usually uses company employees to act as its designee in carrying out inspections, although it intermittently reviews their work. Mr. Mann said that in effect, “the F.A.A. designates the manufacturer as their own judge and jury.” Matthew L. Wald reported from Washington and Jad Mouawad from New York.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/business/23labor.html?ref=boeingcompany">Labor Board Case Against Boeing Points to Fights to Come<date>Published: April 22, 2011</date><text>For businesses, it was the type of action they have feared from a National Labor Relations Board dominated by Democrats. For labor unions, it was the type of action they have hoped for. And for both, it may be a sign of things to come.These fears and hopes were stirred this week when the labor board’s top lawyer filed a case against Boeing, seeking to force it to move airplane production from a nonunion plant in South Carolina to a unionized one in Washington State. Boeing executives had publicly said they were making the move to avoid the kind of strikes the airplane maker had repeatedly faced in Washington; Lafe Solomon, the labor board’s acting general counsel, said the company’s motive constituted illegal retaliation against workers for exercising their right to strike. The agency’s unusually bold action angered business groups and some politicians, who said it was an unwarranted attempt by the government to interfere with a fundamental corporate decision. But under President Obama’s appointees, the agency, including Mr. Solomon and his staff, has sought to reinterpret and more vigorously enforce the rules governing employers and employees, from what workers can say about their bosses on Twitter to the use of Internet and phone voting in union elections. How much ultimately changes will depend in large part on the decisions made by the five-member board, led by Wilma Liebman, that sits atop the agency. That panel hears cases brought by the board’s regional offices — overseen by Mr. Solomon — after employers, workers or unions file complaints. Democratic-dominated boards often tilt toward unions and reverse the decisions of Republican-leaning boards, which usually tilt toward management, and vice versa. The current board — made up of three Democrats and one Republican, with one vacancy — is expected to reverse a Bush-era decision that stripped graduate teaching assistants at private universities of their right to bargain collectively. Labor experts also predict that the board will adopt a policy that makes it easier to organize nursing home workers by allowing unions to go after smaller units of workers inside those homes. The biggest surprise has been the activist stance taken by Mr. Solomon, a career civil servant at the board for 39 years. He became acting general counsel in June 2010, and President Obama nominated him to be the permanent general counsel last January. The Senate has not yet confirmed him to the post. In the Boeing case, Mr. Solomon charged that the company had illegally moved some production work of the 787 Dreamliner passenger plane to South Carolina to punish workers for past strikes and to avoid future ones. The remedy proposed by Mr. Solomon has been denounced as extreme by many business leaders: that Boeing move the work back to its unionized Puget Sound facilities, after it made a $2 billion investment and hired 1,000 nonunion workers in South Carolina. Outraged, the National Association of Manufacturers warned that if the agency won this case, “no company will be safe from the N.L.R.B. stepping in to second-guess its business decisions on where to expand.” Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican, complained, “This is nothing more than a political favor for the unions who are supporting President Obama’s re-election campaign.” The Boeing case was not the first time that Mr. Solomon has riled the business community and its Republican allies. Saying it is the domain of the federal government, he recently threatened to sue four Republican-heavy states — Arizona, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah — in an effort to invalidate recent constitutional amendments that prohibit private sector workers from choosing a union by signing cards, a process known as card check. He has also sought to extend the labor board’s reach into the world of the Internet. He approved requests from regional labor board officials to bring complaints against businesses that punished employees for Facebook and Twitter posts, including one case against Reuters. Mr. Solomon has also proposed that electronic voting be used when workers decide whether they want to unionize their workplace — a proposal that business groups maintain will make it easier for unions to coerce workers. In an interview, Mr. Solomon, a 61-year-old Arkansas native, insisted that he was no radical. “My goal is to enforce the National Labor Relations Act,” he said. That law, enacted in 1935, governs private sector workers’ right to unionize as well as relations between tens of thousands of companies and employees. Mr. Solomon, who has worked for board members of both parties, said this case was straightforward: Boeing had retaliated against workers for exercising their federally protected right to strike. “They had a consistent message that they were doing this to punish their employees for having struck and having the power to strike in the future,” he said. “I can’t not issue a complaint in the face of such evidence.” 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: April 26, 2011 An article on Saturday about differences at the National Labor Relations Board under Democratic and Republican administrations misstated the political affiliation of Marshall Babson, a board member under President Ronald Reagan, who commented on the boardâs recent activities.

In its complaint, the labor board said that Boeing's decision to transfer a second production line for its new 787 Dreamliner passenger plane to South Carolina was motivated by an unlawful desire to retaliate against union workers for their past strikes in Washington and to discourage future strikes. The agency's acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, said it was illegal for companies to take actions in retaliation against workers for exercising the right to strike. Although manufacturers have long moved plants to nonunion states, the board noted that Boeing officials had, in internal documents and news interviews, specifically cited the strikes and potential future strikes as a reason for their 2009 decision to expand in South Carolina. Boeing said it would ''vigorously contest'' the labor board's complaint. ''This claim is legally frivolous and represents a radical departure from both N.L.R.B. and Supreme Court precedent,'' said J. Michael Luttig, a Boeing executive vice president and its general counsel. ''Boeing has every right under both federal law and its collective bargaining agreement to build additional U.S. production capacity outside of the Puget Sound region.'' It is highly unusual for the federal government to seek to reverse a corporate decision as important as the location of plant. But ever since a Democratic majority took control of the five-member board after Mr. Obama's election, the board has signaled that it would seek to adopt a more liberal, pro-union tilt after years of pro-employer decisions under President Bush. Although the board has not yet issued many major decisions reversing Bush-era policies, it has begun requiring private sector employers to post a notice about workers' right to unionize, and Mr. Solomon has begun moving more aggressively to win reinstatement of union supporters fired illegally by management during unionization drives. In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Solomon said: ''A worker's right to strike is a fundamental right guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act. We also recognize the rights of employers to make business decisions based on their economic interests, but they must do so within the law.'' South Carolina's two senators, both Republicans, Lindsey Graham and Jim DeMint, denounced the board's move. ''This is nothing more than a political favor for the unions who are supporting President Obama's re-election campaign,'' Mr. DeMint said. The labor board said that in 2007, Boeing announced plans to create a second production line that would make three 787 Dreamliner planes a month in the Puget Sound area to address a growing backlog of orders. That was to be in addition to a line already making seven Dreamliners a month there. In October 2009, Boeing said it would locate its second line at a new, nonunion plant in South Carolina. The N.L.R.B. asserted that on numerous occasions Boeing officials had communicated an unlawful motive for transferring the production line, including an interview with The Seattle Times in which a Boeing executive said, ''The overriding factor was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we're paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.'' Mr. Solomon brought the complaint after a union representing many of Boeing's Washington workers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, complained that Boeing had decided to move production to South Carolina largely in retaliation for a 58-day strike in 2008. ''Boeing's decision to build a 787 assembly line in South Carolina sent a message that Boeing workers would suffer financial harm for exercising their collective bargaining rights,'' said the union's vice president, Rich Michalski. Mr. Solomon said that if he failed to settle the dispute, an administrative judge would begin hearing the case on June 14 in Seattle. Mr. Solomon said he was not seeking to close the South Carolina factory or prohibit Boeing from assembling planes there. Boeing criticized the timing of the N.L.R.B.'s complaint, saying it came when construction of the factory in North Charleston, S.C., was nearly complete and after 1,000 employees had already been hired there. Boeing said on Wednesday that none of the production jobs in South Carolina had come at the expense of jobs in Washington. It noted that its unionized employment in the Puget Sound area had increased by 2,000 since it announced its decision to expand in South Carolina. The company also said it had decided to expand in South Carolina in part to protect business continuity and to reduce the damage to its finances and reputation from future work stoppages.

That was to be in addition to a line already making seven Dreamliners a month there. In October 2009, Boeing said it would locate its second line at a new, nonunion plant in South Carolina. The N.L.R.B. asserted that on numerous occasions Boeing officials had communicated an unlawful motive for transferring the production line, including an interview with The Seattle Times in which a Boeing executive said, “The overriding factor was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.” Mr. Solomon brought the complaint after a union representing many of Boeing’s Washington workers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, complained that Boeing had decided to move production to South Carolina largely in retaliation for a 58-day strike in 2008. “Boeing’s decision to build a 787 assembly line in South Carolina sent a message that Boeing workers would suffer financial harm for exercising their collective bargaining rights,” said the union’s vice president, Rich Michalski. Mr. Solomon said that if he failed to settle the dispute, an administrative judge would begin hearing the case on June 14 in Seattle. Mr. Solomon said he was not seeking to close the South Carolina factory or prohibit Boeing from assembling planes there. Boeing criticized the timing of the N.L.R.B.’s complaint, saying it came when construction of the factory in North Charleston, S.C., was nearly complete and after 1,000 employees had already been hired there. Boeing said on Wednesday that none of the production jobs in South Carolina had come at the expense of jobs in Washington. It noted that its unionized employment in the Puget Sound area had increased by 2,000 since it announced its decision to expand in South Carolina. The company also said it had decided to expand in South Carolina in part to protect business continuity and to reduce the damage to its finances and reputation from future work stoppages.

Airlines immediately stepped up inspections of aging jets. Federal regulators cut up old planes to look for the spots under the most stress. And Boeing redesigned the joints that hold its 737s together.They thought they had solved the problems. But the five-foot hole in the roof of a Southwest Airlines 737 this month and other recent incidents indicated that they had not. In fact, a stream of safety directives from the Federal Aviation Administration in the years since the Aloha incident shows that structural cracks from metal fatigue remain a persistent problem on older planes. Chillingly, the agency said in one directive that the discovery of some of the most serious damage had been “a purely random occurrence.” Safety experts say that the industry and regulators rely far too much on a patchwork of rules that are largely reactive: each time a problem in one part of the plane is found, inspectors add that area to their checklists. Late last year, the F.A.A. itself acknowledged the seriousness of the issue when, for the first time, it issued a rule to set flying limits for aging aircraft. “The potential for catastrophic structural failure,” it said, “is very significant.” Even so, the F.A.A. took more than four years to write the rule, as airlines objected that it would reduce the value of their planes and force them to ground some they thought could still fly. In response, the F.A.A. toned down the rule, extending a deadline for plane makers to come up with the lifetime limits. John J. Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents, says the F.A.A. needs to do more than wait for the industry to set plane-retirement deadlines and rely on the airlines to do piecemeal inspections. The Southwest incident showed, he said, that the agency should order thorough inspections of a couple of the older and most heavily used 737s, using the latest technologies, to determine where cracks might develop. Right now, he said, “it looks like you’re putting Band-Aids on the airplane.” Referring to both the Southwest incident and an earlier one in 2009, in which an 18-inch hole appeared in another Southwest 737, he said, “Here’s a case where we have a small hole, a big hole and if we’re not going to do something serious about the entire airplane, we’re going to end up with a smoking hole.” F.A.A. and industry officials say they are reviewing their policies on aging planes. But they note that fatigue problems have not caused any deaths on jetliners since the Aloha accident, even with millions of flights a year in the United States. J. Randolph Babbitt, the head of the F.A.A., and Boeing officials said last week that it was too early to conclude that the latest Southwest incident stemmed from metal fatigue. He said investigators were also examining Boeing’s manufacturing processes and other possible causes. But whatever the outcome of the investigation, the older 737s have provided an early warning about the kinds of fatigue damage that other planes could eventually face. They have been sold since 1968, although the Southwest planes that have had problems are part of the series that was redesigned after Aloha, built from 1993 to 2000. The 737 has been an industry workhorse because it is economical for both short and long trips. These planes tend to accumulate the highest number of flights. And given the weak financial state of the industry, some airlines have held on to them longer. But engineers have long known that metal fatigue can develop as a plane’s cabin is pressurized then depressurized over tens of thousands of takeoffs and landings. Crucial parts of the fuselage can develop cracks, much like a paper clip that snaps after being bent back and forth. It is when many small cracks link up that they pose a danger. The Aloha plane had flown nearly 90,000 flights. Boeing had pleaded with the carrier to ground its most-used planes and fix corrosion problems. Federal investigators faulted Aloha’s poor maintenance practices for the accident. 1 2 Next Page » Nicola Clark contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/business/07air.html?ref=boeingcompany">Other Carriers Follow Southwest and Inspect 737s<date>Published: April 6, 2011</date><text>Inspections of Boeing jets widened on Wednesday as Asian and European carriers said they would examine some aircraft as a precaution after cracks expanded into a hole on a Southwest Airlines jetliner last week and forced it to make an emergency landing.The incident, involving a Boeing 737-300, led federal aviation authorities to require inspections of at least 175 of the older Boeing planes after every 500 flights until the problems are better understood. Boeing, the manufacturer, has also recommended that airlines inspect the areas where the skin covers joints on the older 737 models. In response, Southwest, which operates most of the affected planes in service in the United States, has inspected at least 79 aircraft and found minor subsurface cracks in five 737s. On Wednesday, foreign carriers said they were following suit. Scandinavian Airlines said it would inspect four Boeing 737-500s, which while not the same model, were made during the same period as the Southwest jet. The British low cost bmibaby airline will inspect three 737s by April 7, a representative told the B.B.C. Lufthansa, the German carrier, is inspecting three Boeing 737-300s. Martin Riecken, the director of corporate communications, said the planes, which are in service in Europe, had undergone checks over the weekend but would be inspected again in the next few days. “They are going to be tested in our own facilities,” Mr. Riecken said. “We are using the ground times.” The South Korean government has ordered Asiana Airlines and its affiliated budget carrier, Air Busan, to inspect their 737 fleets, according to a report in The Korea Times. And Japan’s government ordered domestic airlines to inspect early model 737s, a total of 46 planes flown by Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and two smaller carriers, a transportation ministry official, Hideki Chiba, said. The official said five of the planes had exceeded 35,000 flights and must be inspected within five days, The Associated Press reported. The flights, referred to as cycles, were fewer than the 39,000 reached by the Southwest Airlines plane in Friday’s incident. The number of flights has attracted scrutiny in the aftermath of Friday’s incident because Boeing said that many of its older 737 jets were prone to metal fatigue much sooner than it had expected. Paul Richter, a senior Boeing engineer, said during a conference call that the company had thought the jets would not be vulnerable to serious cracks in their skin until “much, much later,” and that it was surprised that its safety projections were so far off the mark. Mr. Richter said Boeing had expected the aluminum skin and the supporting joints on the planes to last through 60,000 cycles of takeoffs and landings before airlines need to be concerned about cracks. But the Southwest jet had nearly 40,000 cycles, according to federal regulators. Boeing’s stark admissions underscored how regulators and industry officials were struggling to understand the broader ramifications of the accident. And analysts said the problems could eventually lead to more extensive inspections of a wider variety of aging planes. Southwest has been buffeted by questions about how intensely it operates its planes. But in describing how surprised Boeing was by the accident, Mr. Richter came to the defense of the airline, Boeing’s largest customer. Noting that Southwest operates more 737s than any other airline, Mr. Richter said he thought its involvement in the accident “was just a statistical event far more than anything to do with Southwest and how they operate the aircraft.” But the new information about how soon the fatigue set in raised concerns among aviation safety experts about how much progress the industry had made on such issues, which burst into view when a large section of the roof of a 737 flown by Aloha Airlines ripped open in 1988 and a flight attendant was sucked out of the plane. John J. Goglia, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board from 1995 to 2004, said the Southwest incident again highlighted a problem with older aircraft that endured tens of thousands of pressurization cycles. 1 2 Next Page » Christopher Drew and Jad Mouawad contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DC1039F935A35757C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Says Jet Cracks Are Early<date>Published: April 6, 2011</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED Boeing said Tuesday that many of its older 737 jets were prone to metal fatigue much sooner than it had expected, an admission that largely exonerated Southwest Airlines for the five-foot hole that opened in the roof of one of its planes last Friday.

Southwest has been buffeted by questions about how intensely it operates its planes. But in describing how surprised Boeing was by the accident, Mr. Richter came to the defense of the airline, Boeing's largest customer. Noting that Southwest operates more 737s than any other airline, Mr. Richter said he thought its involvement in the accident ''was just a statistical event far more than anything to do with Southwest and how they operate the aircraft.'' But the new information about how soon the fatigue set in raised concerns among aviation safety experts about how much progress the industry had made on such issues, which burst into view when a large section of the roof of a 737 flown by Aloha Airlines ripped open in 1988 and a flight attendant was sucked out of the plane. John J. Goglia a member of the National Transportation Safety Board from 1995 to 2004, said the Southwest incident once again highlighted a problem with older aircraft that endured tens of thousands of pressurization cycles. ''We're talking about the same issues today, and we're proposing the same fixes,'' he said. ''We need to take a few of these high-cycle airplanes and run them through a very vigorous inspection program and see where we can identify deficiencies, and see whether there is anything different than what the manufacturer thought there would be. But I don't see that happening because it is expensive.'' Mr. Richter, the chief engineer for Boeing's older 737 models, told reporters that Boeing had felt so confident about the joints that it had not planned to tell airlines to inspect that part of the plane until it reached 60,000 cycles. He also said Boeing had redesigned the joints -- where overlapping pieces of the outer skin are riveted together -- in 1993 after weaknesses appeared in an earlier version. After the Aloha accident in 1988, Boeing introduced hundreds of modifications to several of its 737 models. It also recommended that airlines replace joints after 50,000 cycles for the more than 2,000 737s it had already produced. Mr. Richter said the changes in 1993 were expected to make a row of rivets that fasten the flaps of skin together -- also known as lap joints -- hold up better against the tensions caused by repeated pressurization and depressurization. When the joints are stressed by that pressure, ''you get a slight rotation of the material that causes a bending in the skin, right at or adjacent to where this row of fasteners is located,'' he said. ''And it's a combination of the pressure loads in flight and the bending that promotes fatigue growth at a faster rate.'' Aviation experts said that Boeing might have been too confident about the durability of the new design. ''When you model something you make assumptions,'' Mr. Goglia said, ''and if your assumptions are weak, your outcome is compromised.'' Mr. Richter said that the newest generations of 737s -- starting with the 600 series that entered service in 1998 and known as the Next-Generation 737 -- incorporated significant design changes intended to reduce the chance of lap joint cracking. These changes reduce the amount of bending. Large cracks are rare, though they seem to be appearing with more frequency in recent years, including an incident involving a larger Boeing 757 last October in which a 1-foot by 2-foot hole opened up as the plane was flying at 31,000 feet. The F.A.A. issued an airworthiness directive in January mandating that airlines inspect their Boeing 757-200s and 300s, after it received several reports of cracking in the fuselage skin of roof panels. In July 2009, another Southwest flight between Nashville and Baltimore, also a Boeing 737-300, experienced a rapid decompression when an 18-inch hole opened up while the plane was flying at 35,000 feet. The N.T.S.B., in its report on the incident, said the hole was caused by ''continuous fatigue cracks initiated from multiple origins on the inner surface of the skin.'' Those occurred near a step formed at the edge of aluminum panels that had been chemically milled. Mr. Richter said this was fundamentally different from the latest incident on the Southwest flight. In the latest event, the cracks apparently formed inside the holes that fastened two pieces of metal together, he said. Under an emergency directive issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday, all of the planes with more than 35,000 flight cycles must be inspected within five days. Those with 30,000 to 35,000 cycles must be examined within 20 days, and Mr. Richter said that a total of 570 planes, including 737-300s, 400s and 500s built from 1993 and 2000 -- could eventually require the inspections as they reached those milestones.

The F.A.A. announcement applies to 175 aircraft worldwide, including 80 that are based in the United States. Most are operated by Southwest, which started inspections over the weekend and has found three more planes with small cracks. The airline also canceled 70 flights from its schedule of 3,400 departures on Monday. About 300 flights were canceled on both Saturday and Sunday. The incident on Friday was at least the third involving metal fatigue in the last few years, and the most terrifying. The others involved another Southwest 737-300 flight in 2009 and an American Airlines Boeing 757 last year. The recent string of similar problems has baffled safety experts who said the industry assumed it had successfully resolved the problem of metal fatigue after an accident in 1988 involving a 737 jet flown by Aloha Airlines. During the flight, an 18-foot section of the forward cabin ripped open and a flight attendant was blown out of the plane. Southwest insisted that it had done all the required inspections of its aircraft. But the latest problem focused attention on how the carrier uses its planes on up to 12 flight segments a day. Other airlines, which often fly longer routes, typically have six to eight segments for their planes. The plane involved in the incident on Friday had logged 39,000 takeoffs and landings, a relatively high number for a 15-year-old aircraft. The F.A.A. directive focused on planes that had accumulated a large number of takeoff and landing cycles. It applies not only to the 737-300 model but also to similar 737-400 and 500 models, a design that dates back to the early 1980s and is known as the 737 Classic series. “This was a very serious failure,” said William R. Voss, the president and chief executive of the Flight Safety Foundation, an independent nonprofit group. “Is there something wrong with the inspections we’ve been using in the past 20 years, or was there something wrong on the inspection with this one plane?” Hans J. Weber, owner of Tecop International, an aviation consulting firm in San Diego, said that jetliners could easily survive a small crack in the aluminum skin on the fuselage. But what happened in the Aloha accident and the more recent incidents is that multiple small cracks appeared near rivets in areas where the plane experiences the most stress, causing the skin to peel back. “It’s like it unzips,” Mr. Weber said. The F.A.A. directive is intended to detect cracks in places where the skins overlap and other structural weaknesses, J. Randolph Babbitt, the F.A.A. administrator, said in a statement. The directive came shortly after Boeing, the manufacturer, said it was also recommending that airlines inspect the areas where the skin covers joints on the older 737 models. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is conducting an investigation into Friday’s incident, said that it was probably the result of fatigue cracks in these joints. Southwest began flying the plane, which carried 118 passengers, in 1996 and it is among the oldest in its fleet. Mr. Weber said that after the Aloha accident, metal fatigue was a big issue, and the F.A.A. began to require the airlines to conduct more frequent and intense inspections as planes aged and accumulated more takeoffs and landings. “Over the last few years, the attitude has been that we solved the fatigue problem,” he said. “But are we seeing what happens when attention wanders to something else, that we slip a little bit in the quality of the work we do? This is just speculation, but this is what I’m worried about.” Whitney Eichinger, a spokeswoman for Southwest, said the airline was in full compliance with all F.A.A. and Boeing inspection requirements. “We take safety very seriously as do our maintenance folks, which is why our safety record is so solid,” she said. One expert, John J. Goglia, a former N.T.S.B. member, said that the Flight 812 episode might lead to a change in how airlines look for metal fatigue. “The cracking has been known about for a long time,” he said. “It’s nothing new. What might be new is finding it at this location.” But Mr. Weber said that even if the exact location was different from earlier incidents, the fact that it occurred in the roof of the plane “was no surprise.” He added, “Everyone knows the highest stress areas are up in the crown.” This is not the first time that a Southwest plane has had a crack in flight. In July 2009, another plane developed a skin fatigue problem that caused a small puncture in its fuselage. And last year, an American Airlines Boeing 757 experienced a sudden decompression after a 1-foot by 2-foot hole opened in its fuselage in the upper crown above the left door. This prompted the F.A.A. to issue a new airworthiness directive requiring repetitive inspections of more than 680 757s operated by airlines in the United States. The latest F.A.A. directive will require initial inspections that use low-voltage electric currents, called Eddy currents, to help inspectors detect cracks in the 300, 400 and 500 series 737s that have accumulated more than 30,000 flight cycles. It will then require “repetitive inspections” at regular intervals. More details are expected Tuesday when the directive is formally released. Mike Boyd, the chief executive of Boyd Group, an aviation consulting firm, said that while the Southwest episode may seem traumatic, especially to passengers on board, they are, in fact, extremely rare and would not have much impact on how Southwest or other airlines run their operations. “You can always find cracks on an airplane, but I don’t think this is going to be earth-shattering to anybody,” he said.

The airline said it has retested and cleared 19 other planes and planned to finish testing 58 more by Tuesday. Southwest had canceled about 300 daily flights on Saturday and Sunday after the problem on Friday. Robert L. Sumwalt, a member of the board, said in a telephone interview from Arizona that the fatigue would not have been apparent on a visual inspection of the lap joints in the fuselage of the Sacramento flight, and that current regulations did not require high-tech techniques like ultrasound that might have detected the hidden cracks. A fuselage section is being flown to the board’s labs in Washington for a more comprehensive metallurgical examination. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the airline identified and fixed 21 cracks in the fuselage of the plane 11 months ago during a scheduled inspection that lasted more than a week. Outside airline maintenance specialists say such fatigue cracks are not uncommon in older jets. Southwest Airlines has a history of maintenance problems. In 2008, the F.A.A. proposed a $10.2 million penalty, later reduced to $7.5 million, for Southwest’s failure to do mandatory inspections for fuselage fatigue cracking on some of its Boeing 737s. A report that year by the inspector general of the Transportation Department agreed with a whistle-blower’s complaint that an F.A.A. supervisor had been too cozy with Southwest. The report found “serious lapses in F.A.A.’s air carrier oversight.” The Southwest plane involved in the incident on Friday, a 15-year-old Boeing 737-300 carrying 118 passengers, had almost reached 35,000 feet when passengers were frightened by a gunshotlike explosion and the sight of a gaping hole in the cabin ceiling behind the left wing. Some people reported feeling the dizziness that occurs during a swift loss of cabin pressure. Oxygen masks were released and at least two people passed out as the pilot guided the plane to an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station in Arizona. No one was seriously injured. Mr. Sumwalt, a former pilot, said the hole — through which sunlight was visible — was about two feet behind the left wing on the upper part of the fuselage. An inspection found hairline cracks emanating from each of the rivet holes in the joints on the roof. “We have clear evidence that the skin separated along the rivet line,” he said. “The preliminary on-site inspection reveals fatigue along the entire fracture surface.” He said that the cracks were in the underskin of the joint — where two sections of the 737’s skin overlap and are riveted together. He said that federal regulations did not require more sophisticated inspections of the joints. But the board’s finding will go to the F.A.A., which can require such inspections. When asked about the new finding, Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the F.A.A., referred to an earlier statement that said “the F.A.A. is working closely with the N.T.S.B., Southwest Airlines and Boeing to determine what actions may be necessary.” The airline’s own in-depth inspection of the plane in March 2010 revealed 10 cracks in parts of the frame and 11 cracks in the “stringer clips,” which help secure the aircraft skin, according to Service Difficulty Reports listed on the F.A.A. Web site. They were all repaired, the reports said. At that time, the plane had 45,944 flight hours. A total of 288 Boeing 737-300s are flying for airlines in the United States and 931 worldwide, according to the F.A.A. Southwest said the 737-300s were the oldest planes in its fleet. Boeing, in a statement, said it had seen no reason to take fleetwide action involving the planes. The company said it was monitoring all of its in-service planes and helping Southwest and the N.T.S.B. Douglas Clark, an airplane maintenance specialist with Expert Aviation Consulting, an Indianapolis business not involved with the investigation, said, “It’s amazing it didn’t rip open further.” Metal fatigue, he said, “has been something that has plagued the industry for years.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/business/global/10cathay.html?ref=boeingcompany">Cathay to Add 27 Jets as 2010 Profit Soars<date>Published: March 9, 2011</date><text>HONG KONG — Cathay Pacific Airways, one of the biggest carriers serving Asia, on Wednesday announced its second major aircraft order in six months, which comes as it had record earnings and revenue last year.But Cathay cautioned that high oil prices and any slowdown in global demand could easily hurt its performance in the coming months, echoing worries expressed by other international carriers in recent weeks. “Aviation is a challenging and volatile industry,” said Christopher Pratt, the Cathay Pacific chairman, at a briefing announcing the company’s 2010 earnings. “The recent spike in oil prices following instability in the Middle East is a real concern.” The Australian carrier Qantas announced on Wednesday that it was raising its fuel surcharges for international flights for the second time this year, in a bid to compensate for its higher fuel bills. Singapore Airlines also said it would raise fuel surcharges. Still, a sharp rebound in demand for air transport services last year has spurred many airlines, especially in Asia, to expand networks and increase spending plans. Cathay, seen as a bellwether for the airline industry in the region, said that it had agreed to buy 15 Airbus A330-300 aircraft and 10 Boeing 777-300ER planes, and to lease two more Airbus aircraft. All will be delivered by the end of 2015. The purchases come on top of a record order for 36 Airbus and Boeing aircraft by Cathay last September. Together, the 27 aircraft that Cathay has ordered have a list price of about 51 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $6.5 billion. But the final price for Cathay will, as is usual with such transactions, be considerably lower. The company also said it was in discussions about the possible purchase of 14 more aircraft, highlighting the probability that its expansion and fleet-modernization plans were by no means at an end. “Cathay Pacific has ambitious plans moving forward, and we need to ensure that we have a highly efficient and environmentally friendly fleet to meet those plans,” said Tony Tyler, the airline’s departing chief executive. Together with a big order announced on Monday by the HNA Group, one of the largest airline groups in China, Cathay’s spending plans and record profit underscored the rebound last year in air traffic around the world, and in Asia in particular. Cathay’s profit jumped to 14 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2010, from 4.7 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2009. The airline carried 26.8 million passengers and 1.8 million tons of freight, more than ever before. Several other Asian airlines, including AirAsia and Korean Air, have also announced improved earnings for the year in recent weeks. Asian carriers have benefited from the rapid economic growth in the region, which is swelling the ranks of those who can afford air travel. This is making the airlines more resilient than many of their counterparts elsewhere, while rising incomes also make it easier for airlines to pass on fuel increases in higher fares and surcharges, analysts say. Still, analysts and industry executives caution that the rebound is unlikely to continue at the quick pace set last year. Fuel costs, which typically make up 25 percent to 35 percent of airlines’ operating costs, also represent a constant element of uncertainty. “Our results would be adversely affected, and very quickly so, by a return to recessionary economic conditions,” Mr. Pratt said. At present, he said, demand is expected to remain strong in 2011. But this could change if the high prices for oil damp economic activity, he added.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/business/global/09air.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Deals Show Rising Clout of Asian Airlines<date>Published: March 8, 2011</date><text>HONG KONG — Boeing said Tuesday that it had reached deals to sell a total of 43 aircraft to two Chinese airlines, underlining the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region, and China in particular, for airlines and aircraft makers.Air China, the country’s flag carrier, signed an agreement to buy five Boeing 747-8 aircraft, each capable of carrying more than 460 passengers, as part of its drive to expand its international network. In a separate agreement announced Tuesday but still being completed, Hong Kong Airlines, part of HNA Group, said it would purchase 38 Boeing aircraft, including 30 of the plane maker’s new Dreamliners and 6 freighters. Together, the Boeing aircraft are worth about $10 billion at list prices, though purchases are often subject to undisclosed discounts. HNA Group, which is controlled by the government of Hainan Province in China, also announced orders for several business jets from Dassault Aviation and Gulfstream Aerospace. The announcements, made at an aerospace show in Hong Kong, demonstrated just how rapidly many Asian carriers are expanding and how important the region has become for manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus. The market for air travel and freight services has grown dramatically in Asia thanks to the region’s rapid economic growth. Asia-Pacific carriers are forecast to generate collective profits of about $3.7 billion this year, the International Air Transport Association estimated last week. That makes the region the world’s biggest in terms of earnings. North American carriers’ profits are forecast to total $3.2 billion, while European airlines are likely to make a collective $400 million this year, the travel association said. For aircraft manufacturers, too, the region has become increasingly important. Boeing said Tuesday that it expected the region’s air traffic to grow at an annual rate of 6.8 percent over the next 20 years, well above the world average of 5.3 percent. Air travel growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy after that of the United States, will be even more rapid, with a pace of 7.6 percent, the manufacturer estimated. “Asia-Pacific will account for one-third of new airplane deliveries worldwide over the period,” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said Tuesday. “This demand is driven by the fact that Asia-Pacific will account for 44 percent of travel in 20 years’ time, up from around 34 percent today.” The recent increase in fuel prices presents “a challenge” to the airline industry, Mr. Tinseth acknowledged. Crude prices have risen sharply in recent weeks because of the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East. This has weighed heavily on the share prices of airlines, for which fuel prices represent a large part of operating costs. Despite that, Mr. Tinseth said, “we are at the beginning of an aviation upcycle.” The comments echoed statements from Airbus on Monday. Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to take delivery of about 8,560 new aircraft over the next 20 years, Airbus estimated. “Valued at $1.2 trillion, the requirement represents 33 percent of new aircraft deliveries worldwide over the forecast period, with the region overtaking North America and Europe as the largest air transport market,” the company said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/opinion/05sat3.html?ref=boeingcompany">End of the Tanker Saga<date>Published: March 4, 2011</date><text>The Air Force’s decision to award Boeing the multibillion-dollar contract to replace its fleet of Eisenhower-era KC-135 refueling jets appears to have been based on a fair assessment of costs and capabilities rather than favoritism for the home team over its European rival EADS, the maker of Airbus. A fair outcome for this decade-long, deeply marred procurement saga is a relief. We hope the Air Force and all of the military services have learned the right lessons — not just about avoiding possible corruption but also about the need to ensure that every step of the process is transparent to all bidders. The problems date to 2004 when it was discovered that an Air Force official involved in the tanker bidding was angling for a job at Boeing. Senator John McCain rightly scuttled the Air Force’s plan to lease Boeing jets. In a second round, the Air Force decided to buy the jets from a consortium made of EADS and Northrop Grumman. Boeing successfully challenged the decision, arguing that EADS had been given extra credit for offering a much larger jet when the original specifications didn’t award points for size. It also charged that the Air Force — perhaps trying to make up for its previous embarrassment — had provided more guidance to Airbus. The Air Force did a better job the third time. It called for a jet that could meet 372 specifications with no extra points for extra bells and whistles, reducing the space for favoritism or other contestable mistakes. But in its eagerness to protect itself from another challenge, the Air Force was less able to make trade-offs between the cost of the tankers, their performance and capabilities, and the risks that a project of this size entails. This meant that the competition was decided mostly on price, including the jets’ sticker price plus the cost of operating them. Boeing’s smaller 767, which consumes much less fuel, was the predictable winner. The new specifications so clearly favored a smaller jet that Northrop abandoned the contest, leaving EADS to bid alone. As budgets are sliced around the globe, competition for military contracts is likely to keep getting fiercer, with losers increasingly challenging the outcomes. To address this risk, the Pentagon could craft procurement contracts with narrow, rigidly refined specifications. Unfortunately, that could discourage future bidders from innovating and aiming to exceed expectations. A better route would be simply to avoid the kind of dumb mistakes made by the Air Force. All it had to do was avoid conflicts of interest, keep the rules clear and not move the goal posts midway through the game. The military today may be high-tech. But that approach to business has been around for a long time.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/business/global/05tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">EADS Won’t Protest Loss of Tanker Contract to Boeing<date>Published: March 4, 2011</date><text>The European contractor that lost a bid to build Air Force refueling tankers said on Friday that it would not protest the decision, ending years of struggle that had highlighted flaws in the Pentagon’s contracting procedures.The contractor, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, which makes Airbus planes, said it would drop its fight for the tanker business, worth up to $35 billion, and pursue other work from the Pentagon. The decision seals a major victory for Boeing, the Chicago company that won the bid and that also competes with Airbus for commercial plane sales. But it puts Boeing on the spot to deliver the tankers — which transfer fuel in flight to bombers, fighters and cargo planes — on time and on budget after dropping its price to win the contract. EADS said the Air Force had found that Boeing’s bid was 8.8 percent lower than its own after various adjustments were made. Sean O’Keefe, the chief executive of EADS’s North American subsidiary, said the bid rules were “not optimum” for the company, which offered a larger plane. But he said EADS knew that before it bid, and the Air Force evaluation was “handled exactly by the rules.” Ralph D. Crosby Jr., chairman of the EADS unit, said the choice came down to the lowest price and not extra features, like the Airbus plane’s more advanced avionics and its ability to carry more cargo. “I’d just say personally that I hope 25 to 50 years from now, the crews that are either operating these planes or receiving gas from these aircraft are appreciative of that approach,” he said, and then added: “But those were the rules of the competition, and it’s time to put the best interest of the war fighters first. So we’re stepping aside.” Mr. Crosby said that after the Air Force had worked through a complex formula to compare the bids and calculate the present value of the eventual cost of the planes, Boeing’s cost came in at $20.6 billion compared with $22.6 billion for EADS. Analysts have said Boeing won partly because it offered a smaller plane that would be cheaper to operate over 40 years. But they were surprised it won by such a wide margin, and that suggests Boeing was more aggressive in cutting its price. Boeing’s supporters had feared that EADS, which is partly owned by European governments, would use subsidies to lower the price of the tankers, as a panel of the World Trade Organization found that it had done with its commercial jets. But some analysts said on Friday that EADS might not have bid lower out of concern that it would intensify the subsidy debate. Mr. Crosby said the Pentagon faced greater risks in choosing Boeing and that those risks call for “vigilant oversight.” He said that EADS had done more work on tankers for other nations and that was reflected in estimates that EADS would have spent $3.5 billion on the design and engineering work for the Air Force tankers compared to $4.4 billion for Boeing. The Air Force’s pursuit of new tankers has been the Pentagon’s most politically charged contracting effort for nearly a decade. The bidding was its third effort to start replacing hundreds of tankers dating from the Eisenhower and Kennedy years. The first effort ended in a scandal involving a leasing deal with Boeing. EADS, bidding with Northrop Grumman, won the contract in 2008, but government auditors blocked the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective. EADS executives say they spent more than $100 million to bid alone in the final round, a sign of how much the company wants to expand in the American market. The company builds aircraft for the Army and the Coast Guard and needs to offset sharp cuts in European military spending, and Pentagon officials were pleased that it did not protest the tanker award. Lawmakers from the Gulf Coast supported EADS, which would have built a plant in Mobile, Ala., creating thousands of jobs. EADS had also planned to eventually assemble commercial freighter planes at the plant, which would have been its first aircraft factory in the United States. By winning the tanker contract, Boeing was able to dodge that threat. Boeing will have to design and build 18 tankers for $3.5 billion by 2017. It could then negotiate more contracts, worth around $30 billion, for up to 161 planes.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/business/global/26tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing’s Tanker Bid Was Aided by Air Force’s Shifting Rules<date>Published: February 25, 2011</date><text>When a European company offered a larger tanker than Boeing for a lower price in 2008, the Air Force grabbed what seemed like a bargain.But aviation analysts say Boeing won a rematch this week because the government’s preference had shifted to a plane with fewer bells and whistles but one that could be much cheaper to operate in the next few decades. The changes in the bidding rules for one of the Pentagon’s richest contracts were relatively subtle, making the $35 billion award to Boeing on Thursday a surprise for the company’s executives. In the end, the proposed size of the aerial fueling plane offered by Boeing’s rival, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS, seemed to work against it. And Boeing may have won, several analysts said, because its jet could save billions of dollars more in flying costs than any discounts EADS might have offered on its sticker price. Perhaps the most decisive advantage occurred through a change advocated by one of Boeing’s biggest supporters, Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington. Mr. Dicks said that after the earlier bidding collapsed, he persuaded the Pentagon to alter a crucial rule to better reflect the long-term cost of the planes. Under the change, the Air Force agreed to project the cost of the fuel used to power the tankers over a 40-year period, rather than 25 years. Air Force officials have said that the lengthier projections made sense, given that many of its tankers have already been operating for 50 years. Mr. Dicks promoted the change publicly before the latest bidding started, and EADS officials said on Friday that they knew about it. But they say it was one of several rule changes that could help explain how Boeing, America’s top aerospace firm, reversed its prospects on the bid after faltering so badly in 2008. EADS, bidding with Northrop Grumman, won the earlier contest only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing filed a formal protest. The auditors found that the Air Force had been too subjective in evaluating the bids and had given EADS too much credit for some of the extra features of its plane. The successful protest rattled the Pentagon. It had already been embarrassed after an effort to lease tankers from Boeing in 2001 collapsed in a corruption scandal, and it was wary of the intense advertising and lobbying campaigns that both sides had mounted. So top Pentagon and Air Force officials sought to make the evaluation more objective this time, creating a mathematical formula that weighed the bid prices, how well each of the planes met war-fighting needs and the 40-year operational cost estimates. EADS executives said on Friday that they had no reason to question the Air Force’s selection. Louis Gallois, the chief executive of EADS, told reporters that he was “disappointed” and “perplexed” by the decision. But he said EADS would not consider its next steps until the Air Force briefed the company on Monday about the award. EADS has 10 days after that to protest if it decides that the Air Force deviated from the bidding rules. The company, which planned to build an assembly plant in Alabama if it had won, has strong support from lawmakers in the gulf states counting on the jobs to help the region recover from Hurricane Katrina. EADS supporters say that the size of its plane, about 25 percent bigger than Boeing’s, had impressed Air Force officials in 2008. The plane could carry up to two dozen pallets of cargo along with the fuel needed to transfer to bombers and fighters in flight. But since then, the Air Force revised its needs, saying it already had more cargo planes than required. The Air Force also penalized Boeing more substantially than EADS in 2008 for not being as far along in developing its tanker. This time, the Pentagon insisted on a fixed-price contract and did not deduct any points from either bidder for possible production delays. Representative Dicks acknowledged in an interview that his push to weigh the operating costs over 40 years rather than 25 “may have made a big difference,” and independent analysts agreed. The Air Force plans to buy 179 tankers, and it has assumed that fuel prices will rise by an average of 2.5 percent annually over those decades. Boeing’s supporters had said earlier this week that Boeing thought that rate should be higher, and they contended that parts of the Air Force’s formula seemed to favor EADS. But Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of the Airline Monitor, an industry newsletter, said commercial models similar to the EADS tanker burned about 1,900 gallons of fuel per hour, while Boeing’s plane used less than 1,500 gallons. With fuel costs rising, that difference could have offset any advantages for the EADS plane, he said. Both the EADS and Boeing planes could carry more fuel than any of the aging tankers in use today. Analysts also said the Air Force would have had to make greater operational changes if it had bought the EADS plane. Boeing held a celebration Friday at its plant in Everett, Wash., where it made production changes last year to cut costs. As she left the rally, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said in a telephone interview that Boeing had “used sweat equity to get down to brass tacks” and lower its bid. Hundreds of Boeing workers attended the rally, cheering that the contract would save many of their jobs and add thousands more. A job at Boeing, once seen as a ticket to a comfortable life, has become dicier as competition has intensified in the aerospace industry. Boeing’s tanker is based on its 767 passenger jet, and the company had planned to end production of that plane if it had not won the tanker contract. The passenger version of the 767 will be replaced by Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner. Mr. Greenslet noted that the long delays in the 787 program had prompted Boeing to keep the 767 line open longer than planned. And if the new plane had not been delayed, Boeing might not have been in as good a position to bid for the tanker work, he said. Boeing officials had also feared that EADS, which is partly owned by European governments, could rely on subsidies to undercut Boeing’s price or to absorb losses if it won the contract with a low bid. But Guy M. Hicks, a spokesman for EADS’s North American unit, said that while the company’s bid was low, it had still projected a profit. He also said that EADS might have had a more realistic sense of the costs than Boeing, since it is building more tankers for other countries.

Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, said Boeing was “the clear winner” under a formula that considered the bid prices, how well each of the planes met war-fighting needs and what it would cost to operate them over 40 years. After weighing all the factors, the Pentagon determined that Boeing’s bid was more than 1 percent below that of its rival, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, Mr. Lynn said. If the bids had been within 1 percent, the Air Force would have considered 92 additional requirements for the plane as a tiebreaker, and some of those were widely thought to favor the larger EADS plane. The Air Force said the first phase of the contract would be worth $3.5 billion, and it would cover the construction of the first 18 tankers by 2017. Boeing would build 179 tankers in all for about $35 billion. Boeing, its supporters in Congress and independent analysts were all surprised by the outcome, because in recent days, the Chicago-based company seemed to have given up hope of winning. Lawmakers from Washington State, where Boeing assembles a substantial portion of its planes, had complained that the Pentagon had given EADS extra time to bid and had put in place several evaluation rules that seemed to favor the European company, which had submitted its bid through a North American subsidiary. And the choice could still face opposition from lawmakers on the Gulf Coast, who were counting on EADS’s promise to build an assembly plant in Mobile, Ala., that would have created thousands of jobs. “I’m disappointed but not surprised,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said. “Only Chicago politics could tip the scales in favor of Boeing’s inferior plane. EADS clearly offers the more capable aircraft. If this decision stands, our warfighters will not get the superior equipment they deserve.” Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, called the decision “a major victory for the American workers, the American aerospace industry and America’s military.” In a phone interview from her state, she said, “Everybody here is ecstatic. Our economy has been struggling, and this is a good news announcement that we really needed.” EADS had contended that its plane was bigger and better. EADS had also lined up companies from other politically important states, like Ohio, to supply parts. The company has 10 days to decide whether to protest the decision. But it gave no indication of its plans in a statement Thursday. EADS said only that it was concerned that the Air Force had selected a “high-risk, concept aircraft” over its “proven, more capable” refueling tanker. Under the contract, Boeing will eventually build 14 planes a year at plants in Washington and Kansas. The victory will also enable the company to keep open the 767 production line at its assembly plant in Everett, Wash. EADS’s confidence that it could win the competition stemmed partly from the success that its A330 series had in commercial sales over Boeing’s 767 jetliners. And Boeing had planned to phase out the 767 when its new 787 Dreamliner is ready for delivery. The contract, which could be the largest awarded for many years as military budgets tighten, could eventually reach $100 billion. The tankers are like flying gas stations. They transfer fuel in mid-flight to fighters, bombers and cargo planes. Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said the victory could also help Boeing in its battle with Airbus in their much larger fight over sales of passenger jets and freighters. If EADS had won the tanker contract, it planned to eventually assemble commercial freighter planes at the plant in Mobile, giving it a manufacturing foothold that could help expand other sales in the United States. And with sharp budget cuts in Europe, “EADS also faces a home defense market that is imploding like a black hole,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “So it was imperative that they get this contract.” The award could signal the end of a long and often embarrassing effort by the Air Force to replace its aging tankers, which date to the Eisenhower and Kennedy years. The bidding represented the service’s third attempt to obtain new tankers since 2001. The first effort collapsed after Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, blew the whistle on corruption involving an airplane-leasing proposal with Boeing. Northrop Grumman and EADS then won in 2008, only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective. Northrop dropped out last year, prompting the Pentagon to extend the bid deadline to give EADS more time out of concern that Boeing could charge a higher price if it were the only bidder. Boeing had complained that EADS could rely on subsidies from European governments to undercut Boeing’s price or to absorb losses if it won the contract with a low bid. Boeing’s concerns were heightened after a World Trade Organization panel concluded last year that Airbus could not have fielded all its models, including the A330 series, when it did without the subsidies. Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., had said it would be hard for Boeing to match EADS’s price while still meeting shareholder expectations for a reasonable profit. And at an investment conference this month, Mr. McNerney described Boeing’s final offer as “an aggressive but responsible bid.” He also told the investors: “I think the people in this room would be glad if we won at the bid level we put in and would be happy if we lost at a lower level.” Under the proposed leasing deal in 2001, the Air Force would have paid Boeing over $20 billion for 100 tankers, or more than $200 million a plane. Northrop Grumman has said that the bids fell to around $184 million in 2008. Most analysts thought they could come in 5 to 10 percent below that this time, and that Boeing would have to accept low profit margins to win the contract. But Boeing’s triumph could also irritate European leaders. And it could set back Pentagon efforts to encourage bids from foreign companies to create more competition and bring down the cost of weapons systems. The mayor of Mobile, Samuel L. Jones, said city officials had been confident that EADS would win. “It’s very, very disappointing,” he said, “especially since we had won this competition in 2008.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/business/24tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Worries About Imminent Air Force Tanker Deal<date>Published: February 23, 2011</date><text>As the Air Force tries to end its long and often embarrassing effort to buy new aerial fueling tankers, Boeing’s supporters are questioning the fairness of the bidding, while its European rival seems confident it will win the $35 billion contract.The Pentagon plans to announce the winner on Thursday afternoon. Boeing and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, known as EADS, have been locked for years in a nearly operatic struggle over one of the military’s richest contracts. The battle will shift to Congress once the Pentagon makes its choice. Both companies have a lot at stake, especially since the contract for the planes, which are essentially flying gas cans, could later be extended to $100 billion even if military spending falls. But the competition also includes thousands of high-paying jobs, and whether they will end up at Boeing’s plants in Washington State and Kansas or in Alabama, where EADS would build a factory if it won. No matter which company the Pentagon taps, “Congress might just automatically take up arms,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. “The last thing you want in this economic environment is to have your constituents back home think that you aren’t doing all you can to bring jobs to your district.” Boeing’s supporters acknowledge that they are worried. And if the Air Force picks EADS, that could revive concerns in Congress about putting a major military contract in the hands of a foreign company, though EADS says its North American subsidiary would eventually assemble much of each plane in Mobile. Lawmakers who support Boeing contend that the Pentagon’s formula for judging the bids favors the larger European plane over Boeing’s smaller one. They also complain that EADS, which is partly owned by European nations, could use subsidies to underbid Boeing even though the EADS plane would normally cost at least 10 to 15 percent more to build. “I think the Air Force has bent over backwards not only to get EADS to bid, but to give it an advantage,” Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, said Wednesday in an interview. Pentagon officials declined to comment on Wednesday. They have said they steered the bidding “straight down the middle” to get the best deal for the military and to push forward on a project that began in 2001. EADS and its supporters dismiss Boeing’s concerns, saying the rules of the contest have been clear for more than a year and their plane is more modern. “It is my hope that the Air Force will soon put thousands of Alabamians to work building the clearly superior aircraft our war-fighters deserve,” Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, said in a statement on Wednesday. Both companies said they had adjusted their bids in submitting their “best and final” offers on Feb. 10. When reporters asked last week how much EADS had lowered its price, Ralph D. Crosby Jr., the chairman of its North American unit, quipped: “Just enough to win.” EADS also has substantial political backing, particularly among Republican lawmakers. So the fight could also offer another test of how the new Republican majority in the House will handle spending and job issues. And some analysts believe that Congress could still order the Pentagon to split the purchase between the two companies. The bidding marks the third attempt by the Air Force to start replacing hundreds of aging tankers, which date back to the Eisenhower and Kennedy years. They transfer fuel in flight to fighters, bombers and cargo planes. Even some military officials note sardonically that the Allies won World War II in half the time it has taken the procurement process to get to this point. The first effort collapsed after Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, blew the whistle on corruption involving an airplane-leasing proposal with Boeing. Northrop Grumman and EADS, the parent of Airbus, then won in 2008, only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective. Northrop dropped out last year, prompting the Pentagon to extend the bid deadline to give EADS more time out of concern that Boeing could charge a higher price if it were the only bidder. Another complexity was that the EADS plane, based on an Airbus A330-200 commercial jet, could carry more fuel than Boeing’s offering, which is derived from its 767 jetliner, but also could have higher operating costs. So the Pentagon has relied on a mathematical scoring system to adjust the price of each plane, determined by how well it would meet various war-fighting situations and how much it would cost to operate the fleet over 40 years. Boeing’s supporters say that while they initially thought the system might give the smaller plane some advantages, it did not always turn out that way. Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat from Washington State, said that under one simulated war situation, some of the EADS planes were allowed to fly from bases closer to the battle areas than Boeing’s planes, reducing the amount of fuel that the EADS planes would have to burn to make deliveries. He also said the Air Force had projected that fuel costs would increase by an annual average of 2.5 percent over 40 years, while consultants hired by Boeing thought the rate would be higher. He said that reduced a possible cost advantage for Boeing. Guy Hicks, a spokesman for EADS North America, said his company had been hurt by other factors, and both companies were allowed to seek changes in the rules. “But now it seems that some people are taking steps in the ninth inning to try to change the rules,” he said. Boeing’s supporters have also long been rankled by the Pentagon’s insistence that it could not weigh the effects of government aviation subsidies while the World Trade Organization considers cases against both Europe and the United States. That issue is likely to flare up again if Congress debates the Pentagon’s tanker choice.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13emirates.html?ref=boeingcompany">Emirates Airlines Has Big Ambitions<date>Published: February 12, 2011</date><text>DUBAI, United Arab EmiratesBEYOND the artificial archipelagoes shaped like palm trees, not far from the tallest skyscraper in the world, stands another monument to this city-state’s stubborn ambition. Even in this oasis of extravagance, Terminal 3 at the Dubai International Airport startles. It is not merely the world’s largest air terminal. It is the world’s largest building, period. And all 370 acres of it — all 82 moving walkways, 97 escalators, 157 elevators, 180 check-in counters and 2,600 parking spaces — were built with one very well-connected company in mind: Emirates, Dubai’s fast-growing flagship airline. Emirates is pressing ahead with an ambitious expansion, despite the city’s financial near-collapse in 2009. Its executives, with the help of Dubai’s rulers, want to place this Persian Gulf city at the center of a transportation network linking vibrant economies like India and China to Europe and the United States. It might sound like bravado from the bubble years, another case of overreach in this sandy fantasyland. This is, after all, Dubai, where exuberant developers planned not one but three palm-shaped island chains and erected the glass-clad Burj Khalifa — more than twice the height of the Empire State Building — alongside an indoor ski resort. What is more, the recent political upheaval in Egypt provides a potent reminder that Dubai, for all its air-conditioned ease and stability, lives in a dangerous neighborhood. But here inside Terminal 3, the rise of Emirates hardly seems a mirage. Since its founding in 1985, Emirates, which is fully owned by the government, has grown into the world’s largest airline by passenger miles flown. By 6:30 a.m., Terminal 3 is teeming with travelers. Russians bound for Durban, Chinese headed for Khartoum and Indians traveling to San Francisco weave through the restaurants and duty-free shops. Families snooze on the white marble floors. It feels like a giant bazaar, devoted to a new era of air travel: crowded, animated, cosmopolitan. Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, says his airline represents the future of mass air travel. In an era when many international carriers are struggling to sustain themselves, Emirates has filled its planes, raised fares and consistently turned a profit. It earned $925 million in the six months ended last Sept. 30, up from $205 million in the year-earlier period. To win over customers, its executives want to bring a bit of glamour back to air travel. On the double-decker Airbus A380s, full bars are standard in business class, and the first-class cabin includes showers. No one pays for food or drinks, of course, on any Emirates flight. So far, Emirates’ success is partly an accident of geography. Roughly four billion people live within an eight-hour flight from here. But to the consternation of rivals, Emirates also enjoys the patronage of Dubai’s rulers, in particular, Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, who is its chairman. While home-grown airlines in places like Singapore and Hong Kong have also turned those cities into global hubs, Emirates stands apart for the scale of its ambitions. COMPETITORS are fighting back. SkyTeam, the global alliance that includes Delta Air Lines and Air France/KLM, said recently that it would add two airlines — Middle East Airlines, from Lebanon, and Saudi Airlines — to counter Emirates’ dominance in the region. “There is a reason that airlines around the world are afraid of the success of Emirates,” says John Leahy, chief operating officer of Airbus, the European plane maker, referring to Emirates’ mix of quality service, operating efficiency and low costs. “That should strike fear in the hearts of airlines around the world.” Emirates is one of Airbus’s top customers. Over the next two decades, air travel in the Middle East is expected to grow by more than 7 percent a year, outpacing every other region, according to a forecast from Boeing in 2010. Much of that growth will be spurred by Emirates and two other fast-expanding airlines based in the Persian Gulf area: Etihad Airlines, based in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar Airways. Emirates is by far the most ambitious of the three. Its greatest strides have come from building routes to developing countries long neglected by traditional carriers and providing an alternative to local airlines. Instead of connecting through European hubs like London or Frankfurt, all of these new routes run through Dubai. “The legacy carriers still see us as the monster of the Middle East, the bête noir of civil aviation in the 21st century,” says Mr. Clark, 61. “But they won’t accept that the business we are carrying wasn’t theirs anyway. The 21st century is very different from the 20th century.” Emirates, for instance, offers 184 flights a week from Dubai to India, to cities like Ahmedabad, the commercial hub in the state of Gujarat. It flies to 17 cities in Africa and, in China, to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. It runs two daily flights to Bangkok and nine to Australia. The strategy has prompted a strong reaction from airlines like Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. These carriers hope to persuade their governments to limit Emirates’ access to French and German airports. 1 2 3 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/business/12nocera.html?ref=boeingcompany">From the Pentagon, a Buy Rating on Contractors - Talking Business<date>Published: February 11, 2011</date><text>At the Cowen &amp; Company military industry investment conference on Wednesday, the breakfast speaker was a man named Ashton B. Carter. A former academic and industry consultant, Dr. Carter, as he likes to call himself — he has a doctorate in theoretical physics, in case you were wondering — is the Defense Department’s under secretary for acquisitions, technology and logistics. That is, he’s the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer.Cowen is a small firm, but its military analyst, Cai von Rumohr, has been on the beat for more than 40 years. Companies tend not to turn him down when he invites them to his conference. W. James McNerney Jr., the chief executive of Boeing, would be making a presentation later in the day, as would executives from Northrop-Grumman and other contractors. Big institutional investors like T. Rowe Price were out in force. As was the Defense Department. In addition to Mr. Carter, a top Naval official was scheduled to present the next afternoon. If you’re wondering what high-ranking Pentagon officials were doing at an investment conference, well, suffice to say that this was not a question on the minds of the people in this room. They’ve gotten used to it. For the last few months, beginning with a secret meeting last October, Defense Department officials have been making the rounds of analysts and investors. Their main message, to put it bluntly, is that even in an era of tighter budgets, the Pentagon is going to make sure the military industry remains profitable. “Taxpayers and shareholders are aligned,” Mr. Carter intoned on Wednesday. Then he laid out a series of reforms that he said would both increase competition and maintain, as he put it, “profitability over the long term” — a phrase he repeated for emphasis. He told the assemblage that the Pentagon would frown on mergers among the five giant military contractors — the so-called primes: Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman and Boeing. However, he added, the Defense Department was going to encourage mergers among smaller military contractors. And, he said, “we will be attentive” to innovative smaller companies that provide services (as opposed to weapons systems) to the Pentagon. If you were an investor in the military industry, would you find this useful information? You bet — this is the stuff that can move markets. Although Mr. Carter made several references to “market forces,” the only market for the military industry is the government, which spends some $400 billion a year on weapons systems and other purchases. In economic terms, the Pentagon is a “ monopsony,” a single buyer with life-or-death power over its vendors. If the Pentagon wants the military industry to be healthy and profitable, it can pretty much ensure that outcome. Not being an industry insider, however, I found myself a little taken aback by Mr. Carter’s “guidance.” Monopsony or not, why should the Pentagon be talking up the stocks, even implicitly, of the companies it buys from? Why was Mr. Carter going out of his way to talk to investors and analysts? Didn’t he have more important things to do? The answer, I eventually learned, has to do with something that happened a very long time ago, and goes under the category of “Be careful what you wish for.” Let’s just say that banking isn’t the only industry where the government has allowed a handful of companies to become too big to fail.  The year was 1993. Bill Clinton was the new president, and Les Aspin was his defense secretary. As recounted later by Norman R. Augustine, then the chief executive of Martin Marietta, Mr. Aspin called together about 15 C.E.O.’s of the prime military contractors for a dinner at the Pentagon. Mr. Augustine would memorably label this dinner the Last Supper. Mr. Aspin and several other high-ranking Pentagon officials (including Mr. Carter, who was then an assistant secretary of defense) had brought the group together to send a tough message. With the Berlin Wall gone, the Soviet Union dissolved — and the Pentagon budget flat-lining — the Defense Department was no longer willing, as Mr. Augustine later recounted, “to pay the ballooning overhead” of all those contractors. In no uncertain terms, Mr. Aspin told the group that they needed to start merging. “The rest is history,” Mr. Augustine later wrote. “General Electric Aerospace merged with Martin Marietta, which combined with Lockheed. McDonnell Douglas joined Boeing. Grumman joined Northrop. When the dust had cleared, there were only a few firms left standing.” Five, to be exact. The Last Supper has become part of the lore of the military industry — though partly that’s because Mr. Aspin’s prediction about tighter Pentagon budgets turned out to be so wrong. “On the day George W. Bush took office,” said Loren B. Thompson, a well-known military consultant, “defense spending was around $300 billion.” Today it is more than double that amount, around $700 billion. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — not to mention the Pentagon’s voracious appetite for expensive weapons systems, and the lack of competition among the remaining contractors — have been a gold mine for the Big Five. Not surprisingly, for most of the first decade of the 21st century, the stocks of these companies soared. But after peaking in 2008, they came crashing back to earth. Which, for the Pentagon, has turned out to be a problem. These companies need access to the capital markets, which is more difficult when their stocks are down. And the Pentagon simply can’t allow them get into serious financial difficulty; there are just too few of them. “What we can’t afford from the defense perspective is a sick industry,” said Jacques S. Gansler, a former procurement official for the Pentagon who teaches at the University of Maryland. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Belfiore-t.html?ref=boeingcompany">Book Review - Jet Age - By Sam Howe Verhovek<date>Published: February 4, 2011</date><text>In Sam Howe Verhovek’s “Jet Age,” a letter writer contemplates life at 35,000 feet. “My darling,” he says, “the blue Mediterranean Sea is under us and the coast appears in the distance as a dark shadow. In the sky there is much light, and never as now have I been so happy.” He paid a heavy price for that transcendent view. Moments later, he and everyone else aboard their de Havilland Comet perished when the plane blew apart in the air.The year was 1954, and the letter writer was one of the privileged few to travel in the first jet airliner. The Comet had fatal flaws, as it turned out, resulting in multiple crashes and giving the rival Boeing 707 the second-­mover advantage it needed to secure the market for itself. “Jet Age” is ostensibly about the race between two companies and nations to commercialize a military technology and define a new era of air travel. There’s Boeing with its back to the wall and its military contracts drying up, betting everything on passenger jets, pitted against de Havilland and the government-subsidized project meant to reclaim some of Britain’s lost glory. At the heart of “Jet Age” is a page-turning detective story (what made the first jet airliner keep crashing?) with characters as finely drawn as those in a work of fiction, and infused with the infectious sense of wonder for heavier-than-air flight that drove ordinary men and women to reach for extraordinary heights. But the book is really about the risk-taking essential for making any extreme endeavor common­place. “Jet Age” celebrates the managers, pilots, engineers, flight attendants and, yes, even passengers (for without passengers there is no business) who gambled everything so that we might cross oceans and continents in hours rather than days. It is easy to forget, in this time of overcrowded flights, demoralizing security checks, embattled flight attendants and dwindling service, that risk was once embraced as a necessary, even desirable, part of flying. Quoted in the book, the celebrated aviator Lord Brabazon summed it up in post-accident testimony: “You know, and I know, the cause of this accident. It is due to the adventurous, pioneering spirit of our race. It has been like that in the past, it is like that in the present, and I hope it will be in the future.” Verhovek, a former reporter for The New York Times, points out that the impact of the transition from props to jets in long-distance travel has yet to be equalled. What he leaves out is that we are now on the cusp of another movement to commercialize a mode of travel formerly reserved for governments: space flight. Rocket planes, orbital taxis and commercial space stations are all poised, like the jets before them, to open our vistas as never before. We just have to be willing to accept the necessary risks. Seen in that light, the events of the early jet age are as relevant today as they were half a century ago. “Jet Age” falls short on a couple of crucial technical points. How exactly did a crack in a window lead to catastrophic structural failure? Why were oval windows part of the solution? But those details can be found elsewhere. It’s the pioneers, the risk-takers, who shine in “Jet Age,” and that’s entirely appropriate. Michael Belfiore is the author of âRocketeers: How a Visionary Band of Business Leaders, Engineers, and Pilots Is Boldly Privatizing Space.â</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/science/space/01private.html?ref=boeingcompany">Where No Business Has Gone Before, With Help From NASA<date>Published: January 31, 2011</date><text>BOULDER, Colo. — Sitting in a testing facility at the University of Colorado, the inner shell of the Dream Chaser space plane looks like the fuselage of an old DC-3.The test structure has been pushed and pulled to see how it holds up to the stresses and strains of spaceflight. With an additional infusion of money from NASA, the company that makes the Dream Chaser, Sierra Nevada Space Systems, hopes to complete the rest of the structure and eventually take astronauts to orbit. “Our view is if we could stop buying from the Russians, if we could make life cheaper for NASA, and if we could build a few vehicles that do other things in low-Earth orbit that are valuable, isn’t that, at the end of the day, a good thing?” said Mark N. Sirangelo, the company’s chairman. The Dream Chaser is one of several new spacecraft that companies are hoping to launch into space with help from the government. Last year, the Obama administration pushed through an ambitious transformation for NASA: canceling the Ares I rocket, which was to be the successor to the current generation of space shuttles, and turning to the commercial sector for astronaut transportation. So far, most of the attention in this new commercial space race has focused on Boeing, which has five decades of experience building spacecraft, and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation — SpaceX, for short — a brash upstart that gained credibility last year with two launchings of its Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, a founder of PayPal and chief executive of Tesla Motors, already has a NASA contract for delivering cargo to the space station, and says that it can easily add up to seven seats to its Dragon cargo capsule to make it suitable for passengers. Boeing is also designing a capsule, capable of carrying seven passengers, under the corporate-sounding designation of CST-100. But Boeing and SpaceX are not the only competitors seeking to provide space taxi services, a program that NASA calls commercial crew. Last year, in the first-round financing provided for preliminary development, Sierra Nevada Space Systems won the largest award: $20 million out of a total of $50 million. In December, another space company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, announced it had submitted a similar bid for a space plane it wants financed during the second round. NASA is to announce the winners by the end of March, and they will divide $200 million. About half of NASA’s $19 billion budget goes toward human spaceflight — the space shuttles, the International Space Station — and $200 million this year is just a small slice. “If this is indeed the path to do this work, it’s probably not what they should be putting into it,” said Mr. Sirangelo, who is also chairman emeritus of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group. “But on the other hand, it’s a lot more than we had before. And it’s an acknowledgment there’s momentum in the industry and what we’re trying to accomplish. So that’s good.” After the second round, NASA would like narrow its choices down to two, maybe three, systems to finance. “We think this is in effect a one-year race to see who gets the furthest,” Mr. Sirangelo said, “and at the end of that, presumably the next two years of the authorization bill gets funded, and then you compete for that pot of money.” The blueprint for NASA, passed by Congress last year and signed into law by President Obama, calls for spending on commercial crew to rise to $500 million each year in 2012 and 2013. Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who was one of the primary architects of the blueprint, as the authorization act was called, has said the intent was to provide $6 billion over six years. But what Congress puts into the budget could be far less. “They’re not getting $6 billion over six years for commercial crew,” said a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak for attribution. “That’s never going to happen.” The aide estimated commercial crew might receive half that much. In addition, Congress has not passed the final 2011 budget, and Mr. Obama wants to freeze spending at many federal agencies. Whether the freeze includes NASA will not be known until the president’s 2012 budget request is released in two weeks. While Sierra Nevada has the lowest profile of the companies seeking commercial crew business, it is not new. The parent company, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, is a privately held defense electronics firm founded in 1963, and a few years ago, it bought several space companies and rolled them into the space systems subsidiary. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 2, 2011 An article on Tuesday about the emerging role of private businesses in NASAâs spaceflight program misstated the number of passengers a crew capsule in development at Boeing would be capable of carrying.

Is Said to Affirm That Boeing Received Improper Subsidies<date>Published: January 31, 2011</date><text>PARIS — A panel at the World Trade Organization ruled on Monday that Boeing had received up to $5 billion in improper subsidies for its 787 Dreamliner and other jets, giving it an unfair advantage against its European rival, Airbus, European officials said.The confidential ruling affirmed the W.T.O’s interim findings in September in response to a longstanding complaint by Europe over United States government support of Boeing, officials briefed on the decision said. The panel’s ruling came just weeks ahead of an expected decision by the Pentagon on a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with aerial refueling tankers. Airbus said it expected the final W.T.O. report to say that Boeing would not have been able to start the Dreamliner project without illegal subsidies. But Boeing responded that it would have built the plane just as it had even without the subsidies. European Union officials hope that the findings would undercut complaints by American lawmakers that Boeing is facing a subsidized rival in Airbus in the tanker contest. “This solid report sheds further light on the negative consequences for the E.U. industry of these U.S. subsidies and provides a timely element of balance in this long-running dispute,” said John Clancy, a spokesman for the European Union’s trade commissioner. The W.T.O’s ruling is subject to appeal. But it could bring a protracted battle over aircraft subsidies to a climax and help shift the competitive landscape. Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, would not discuss the findings. But she said officials in Washington remained “confident that the W.T.O. will confirm the U.S. view that European subsidies to Airbus dwarf any subsidies that the United States provided to Boeing.” In a case decided last June, the W.T.O. found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies to vault past Boeing to become the top jet builder. That ruling concluded that Airbus had received $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants to produce its six best-selling models, including the A380 superjumbo. It also concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,” without the subsidies. The ruling on Monday was on a countersuit by Europe contending that Boeing had received nearly $24 billion in research subsidies from federal space and military agencies and in tax breaks from three states. American officials have said the subsidies found to be improper amounted to less than $5 billion. An Airbus spokeswoman, Maggie Bergsma, said the company estimated it had lost as much as $45 billion in sales to Boeing from 2001 and 2006 as a result of the subsidies. Boeing, meanwhile, has asserted that low-interest loans to Airbus have yielded benefits to the European plane maker valued at as much as $200 billion in today’s dollars. Both sides have strained to calculate the largest numbers they can in terms of economic harm. The W.T.O. has not quantified the damages. European officials have focused on contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Defense Department since the late 1970s to research lightweight carbon composite materials similar to those used in the 787 Dreamliner. About half of the 787’s structure is made of the fuel-efficient materials, more than on any other jetliner. With 847 orders worth $90 billion to $100 billion, the 787 — despite a series of manufacturing hiccups — is the fastest-selling plane ever. Boeing is counting on it to move back ahead of Airbus in total sales. The Americans have said that only $2.6 billion of the NASA research money was found to have involved subsidies, compared with $10 billion claimed by Europe. But one person in Europe, who would speak only anonymously since the findings were confidential, said the latest report singled out eight NASA programs and about 130 contracts from 2001-6 as involving some form of illegal subsidies. The bulk of those contracts could be connected to the 787 development program, the person said, though many were also linked to Boeing’s 777 and 737 models. The trade panel pegged the value of the tax advantages from Washington State, Kansas and Illinois at $400 million, though Boeing was to receive more later. Both sides said the panel reiterated an earlier finding that Boeing had received $2.2 billion in export-related aid under a program canceled in 2006. Nicola Clark reported from Paris and Christopher Drew from New York.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/business/28tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Senate Looks at Accidental Release of Boeing Data<date>Published: January 27, 2011</date><text>It was hardly the 18 1/2 -minute gap of Watergate lore.But a Senate committee on Thursday delved into the forensics of whether a confidential data file related to a $35 billion Air Force contract was opened for 15 seconds or 3 minutes, and what did the service know about it and when did it know it. The file was opened last November by a manager for one of the bidders, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS. That set off a furor because it contained data about the Air Force evaluation of a bid by Boeing, a rival, to supply aerial refueling tankers. The Air Force has acknowledged that it accidentally sent each company data about the other’s bids. And once it found out that the EADS worker had briefly opened some of the data, but Boeing had not, it resent the discs to both companies to make sure the playing field was level. But as the Air Force prepares to seek final bids, the Senate Armed Services Committee, prodded by Boeing’s supporters, demanded the investigative files and held the hearing to examine how the service could have been so sloppy, especially given that two previous efforts to award the contract had collapsed. Steven Shirley, the executive director of the Defense Department’s cybercrime center, said an examination of an EADS computer and other records supported the company’s contention that the manager had looked at the file only briefly before realizing it involved Boeing’s data. Pentagon officials described the document as a one-page spreadsheet with 10 lines of preliminary data about how the service scored the Boeing jet’s efficiency in sample refueling missions. EADS executives said the employee had closed the file in less than 15 seconds and began trying to reach company security officers for help in locking up the disc. At one point, Mr. Shirley said he “roughly” agreed with that estimate. But he later said investigators had told him the file remained open for about three minutes, presumably while the employee was seeking the help. Still, he said, “what we found on the computer was consistent” with EADS’s assertions that it had quickly reported the mistake to the Air Force. A report from the forensics lab said that EADS had not saved or copied the data. EADS has said that it immediately took the employee off the program and allowed him to rejoin it only after the Air Force resent the data to both companies and authorized his return. The investigative reports, released by the committee, also shed new light on how the mix-up occurred. One report said separate groups within the Air Force wrote the transmittal letters and prepared the discs, and that instructions for packaging them were misconstrued. The Air Force reassigned two officials involved in the mistake. But Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, where Boeing has its defense division headquarters, suggested they should have been punished more severely. “This is a case study of incompetence in contract competition, this whole debacle, from the beginning to this very moment,” she said. The Air Force’s first effort to replace its Eisenhower-era tankers collapsed after corruption charges involving a leasing proposal with Boeing. EADS, the parent of Airbus, was part of a team that won the competition in 2008, only to have the government block the award after Boeing protested. The battle is also highly political, with thousands of jobs for Washington State and Kansas if Boeing wins or for Alabama if EADS does. Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, said Boeing could have filed a protest if it was harmed by the mistake.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/business/27boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing’s Shares Slip as Forecast Falls Below Estimates<date>Published: January 26, 2011</date><text>Boeing predicted that its profit in 2011 would fall below analysts’ estimates, mainly because of higher pension expenses and delays in finishing the 787 Dreamliner, setting off a 3 percent decline in its share price.The company said it expected to deliver 25 to 40 of the 787s and the new 747-8 freighter before the year’s end. During a conference call with analysts, the chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said about half of those planes would be Dreamliners. To the surprise of some analysts, Mr. McNerney said the company expected to meet its plan for sharply expanding production of the Dreamliner over the next three years. Both the Dreamliner, the first passenger jet made substantially of lightweight carbon composites, and the 747-8 freighter have faced production problems. The Dreamliner — which has more advance orders, 847, than any plane in history — is running three years late. Boeing recently pushed back delivery of the first plane to the third quarter of this year. As a result of the delays, and an increase of 58 cents a share in pension expenses this year, Boeing said that its net income would be $3.80 to $4 a share in 2011. That compared with an average estimate by analysts of $4.53 a share. The company released its forecast as part of its fourth-quarter earnings report. Boeing said its profit fell 8 percent, to $1.17 billion, or $1.56 a share, in the period, down from $1.28 billion, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Revenue also fell 8 percent, to $16.55 billion from $17.94 billion. Boeing, based in Chicago, said it earned $4.45 a share in 2010, in part because of a gain of 50 cents a share on a favorable tax settlement. It expected revenue of $68 billion to $71 billion in 2011, compared with $64.3 billion in 2010, as it begins delivering the new planes. Boeing’s shares had rallied about 10 percent since late December on hopes that the company was putting its problems behind it. The stock slipped by $2.22, or 3.1 percent, to $70.02 on Wednesday. Mr. McNerney said Boeing had stepped up efforts to cut costs in its large military business as the Pentagon tightened spending. But as air travel rebounds from the recession, Boeing should get a lift from its commercial operations. It expects to deliver 485 to 500 passenger jets in 2011, up from 462 in 2010. Its rival, Airbus, delivered 510 planes in 2010 and expects to increase that total this year. Boeing is counting on the Dreamliner to give it an edge. Mr. McNerney said the company still believed that it could increase production to 10 planes a month by the end of 2013, from two now. He told analysts that Boeing was reworking a number of poorly made parts from suppliers on the first 20 to 25 Dreamliners. But as it builds the 31st plane, he said, the problems are “healing up,” and the production line has become more stable. Some analysts were surprised that the company still expected to deliver 12 to 20 Dreamliners this year. Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that he had thought Boeing would deliver six 787s and six 747-8s in 2011. Mr. McNerney said that while the delays had pushed back the start of its production increase, company executives had built a cushion into their plans and had privately expected to begin building 10 Dreamliners a month well before the end of 2013. “A lot of that margin is now eaten up by this latest delay,” he said. “But we are not changing significantly the trajectory of our ramp.” Boeing’s chief financial officer, James A. Bell, said the company was projecting an eventual profit on the Dreamliner, though it would not make money on the 787s and 747s delivered this year. Mr. McNerney also said Boeing was likely to build a replacement for its best-selling 737 by 2020.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/business/19boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Again Delays Delivery of 787 Dreamliner<date>Published: January 18, 2011</date><text>The Boeing Company on Tuesday pushed back the first delivery of its 787 Dreamliner to the third quarter, hoping that the delay will give it enough time to finish a jetliner that is more than three years behind schedule.The latest delay is a result of a fire in an electrical panel that forced a test plane to make an emergency landing in November. Boeing had to suspend test flights while it redesigned some parts, and it just resumed flights on Monday to test systems that require federal certifications. Boeing’s last projection had anticipated the first delivery in February. But the company, based in Chicago, said Tuesday that it did not expect the delay to have a material impact on its earnings for 2011. The Dreamliner is the first passenger jet made substantially with lightweight carbon composites that could sharply reduce fuel costs. Boeing is counting on the midsize jet to retake the lead in commercial airplane sales from Airbus. Analysts said the delay — which means that the first delivery could come any time from July through September — matched general expectations, and Boeing’s stock rose more than 3 percent. Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that investors were glad to see that the projected delay was not longer. He said investors seemed comfortable that the 787 problems were “not a showstopper, and will not have a meaningful impact on the positive trajectory of this aerospace upcycle.” Over the last several years, Boeing has repeatedly pushed back the delivery date for the innovative plane, which has attracted more advance orders — about 850 — than any passenger jetliner in history. Boeing executives have acknowledged that they outsourced too much of the design and production work. Boeing has had to rework many parts that were poorly made, and executives have said the company might have to build 40 to 50 of the planes before it overcomes all the problems. The company has also had to halt parts deliveries and slow its production line several times in recent months to try to regain control. As a result, analysts say the company is unlikely to deliver more than a few planes this year. And they are waiting to see whether the latest delay has an impact on the company’s plans to sharply increase production in 2012 and 2013. Despite the delays, investors have remained relatively patient. Boeing still has a two- to three-year edge over Airbus in building more fuel-efficient carbon planes, and the demand for new planes is strong as airlines emerge from the recession. But it is also clear that the plane will not be as profitable as once seemed possible. Boeing, which has had to spend billions more than expected on its development, does not receive most of its payments until it delivers the planes. Because of the delays, it also owes several billion dollars in penalties to suppliers and airlines. Moreover, the trade publication, Flight International, recently reported that Boeing had offered steeper discounts than previously known to win some orders. The publication said that from 2004 through 2006, Boeing had agreed to sell more than 300 Dreamliners at prices, excluding engines, that ranged from $66 million to $84 million, or much lower than the $100 million or more that analysts had estimated. Airbus received 644 orders for its various models in 2010, just ahead of Boeing’s 625. Airbus said on Tuesday that it had raised the average price of its planes by 4.4 percent. Boeing had announced an average price increase of 5.2 percent at the end of 2010.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/business/global/18plane.html?ref=boeingcompany">G.E. to Share Jet Technology With China in New Joint Venture<date>Published: January 17, 2011</date><text>This article was reported by David Barboza, Christopher Drew and Steve Lohr and written by Mr. Lohr.As China strives for leadership in the world’s most advanced industries, it sees commercial jetliners — planes that may someday challenge the best from Boeing and Airbus — as a top prize. And no Western company has been more aggressive in helping China pursue that dream than one of the aviation industry’s biggest suppliers of jet engines and airplane technology, General Electric. On Friday, during the visit of the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, to the United States, G.E. plans to sign a joint-venture agreement in commercial aviation that shows the tricky risk-and-reward calculations American corporations must increasingly make in their pursuit of lucrative markets in China. G.E., in the partnership with a state-owned Chinese company, will be sharing its most sophisticated airplane electronics, including some of the same technology used in Boeing’s new state-of-the-art 787 Dreamliner. For G.E., the pact is a chance to build upon an already well-established business in China, where the company has booming sales of jet engines, mainly to Chinese airlines that are now buying Boeing and Airbus planes. But doing business in China often requires Western multinationals like G.E. to share technology and trade secrets that might eventually enable Chinese companies to beat them at their own game — by making the same products cheaper, if not better. The other risk is that Western technologies could help China play catch-up in military aviation — a concern underscored last week when the Chinese military demonstrated a prototype of its version of the Pentagon’s stealth fighter, even though the plane could be a decade away from production. The first customer for the G.E. joint venture will be the Chinese company building a new airliner, the C919, that is meant to be China’s first entry in competition with Boeing and Airbus. For the most part, Western aviation executives say the Chinese are simply too far behind in both civilian and military airplane technology to cause any real fears anytime soon — although it does put pressure on Boeing and Airbus to continue to innovate and stay technologically ahead of China. G.E., which said it had briefed the commerce, defense and state departments on details of the deal, acknowledges that pairing up with a Chinese firm is a delicate dance. But because the commercial aircraft market in China is expected to generate sales of more than $400 billion over the next two decades, it is not a party the company is willing to miss. Eventually, G.E. executives say, China will become a potent player in the commercial jetliner market, and the company wants to be a major supplier to the emerging Chinese producers. “They are committed for the long term and they have every probability of being successful,” said John G. Rice, vice chairman of G.E. “We can participate in that or sit on the sidelines. We’re not about sitting on the sidelines.” Mr. Rice also said that the Chinese joint venture partner — the aerospace design and equipment manufacturer Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or Avic — has supplied G.E. with some parts for jet engines for years. And he said he had personally known Avic’s president for a decade. “This venture is a strategic move that we made after some thought and consideration, with a company we know,” Mr. Rice said. “This isn’t something we were forced into” by the Chinese government. G.E.’s new joint venture in Shanghai will focus on avionics — the electronics for communications, navigation, cockpit displays and controls. G.E. will be contributing its leading-edge avionics technology — a high-performance core computer system that operates as the avionics brain of Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner. The joint venture has a ready customer in the C919’s builder, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, which is also a government-owned enterprise. The plane will be a single-aisle airliner, carrying up to 200 passengers, intended to compete with Boeing 737s and Airbus 320s. Although the Chinese hope to begin deliveries in 2016, analysts say the schedule may well slip. With or without the C919, the Chinese market for commercial airliners is already huge and growing fast — a big market for G.E. jet engines and other systems, as well as Boeing and Airbus planes. But if the C919 grabs any significant slice of that market, it would represent a new, expanded opportunity for G.E. The company has already been chosen to supply engines for the Chinese plane, through its long-standing partnership with Snecma of France. Though the world’s largest producer of jet engines, G.E. has trailed other suppliers of avionics in overall sales, behind Honeywell, Rockwell Collins and Thales, all of whom competed for the C919 business. Several other American companies have also been chosen as suppliers for the C919 aircraft, providing power generators, fuel tanks, hydraulic controls, brakes, tires and other gear. The roster of United States suppliers includes Rockwell Collins, Honeywell, Hamilton Sundstrand, Parker Aerospace, Eaton Corporation and Kidde Aerospace. In fact, the corporate competition for contracts on the C919 became a “frenzy,” said Mark Howes, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific. The Chinese government, he said, had made it clear to Western companies that they should be “willing to share technology and know-how.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/us/politics/07daley.html?ref=boeingcompany">William Daley Brings Management Experience as Chief of Staff<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — He is a top executive at JPMorgan Chase, where he is paid as much as $5 million a year and supervises the Washington lobbying efforts of the nation’s second-largest bank. He also serves on the board of directors at Boeing, the giant military contractor, and Abbott Laboratories, the global drug company, which has billions of dollars at stake in the overhaul of the health care system.And now William M. Daley, the son and brother of Chicago mayors and a behind-the-scenes political player himself, will hold one of the most powerful jobs in Washington: chief of staff in the White House, where he will help decide who gets into the Oval Office and what President Obama’s Capitol Hill agenda should be. Mr. Daley’s recruitment to Pennsylvania Avenue from the corporate boardroom is seen as a smart step by some in Washington, who argue that Mr. Obama has long needed a White House confidant who has the ear of the business community and a record of bipartisanship that might help the president negotiate with Republicans in Congress. “I think it’s a very, very strong choice,” said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has been a harsh critic of the Obama administration and provided financial support that helped Republicans take control of the House in the November elections. “Daley is a business person who understands politics.” Mr. Daley, or the corporations he has served in recent years, have worked aggressively behind the scenes to water down or defeat central elements of Mr. Obama’s agenda, opposing the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and elements of the health care bill. That record is among the reasons his appointment, announced by Mr. Obama on Thursday afternoon, has alarmed some of the president’s liberal supporters, who say that bringing Mr. Daley into the White House violates a commitment to curtail the sway of special interests. “As the chief of staff, he is the gatekeeper, and that means real power in Washington,” said Ellen S. Miller, co-founder of the Sunlight Foundation, which celebrated the move by Mr. Obama early in his presidency to release detailed logs of White House visitors and to impose restrictions on hiring lobbyists as aides. “Just about any way you look at it, it creates a huge potential for a conflict of interest.” The chief of staff job has sometimes been filled by corporate types, like Donald T. Regan, a top Wall Street executive and former Treasury secretary, who held the job in the Reagan administration. But more often, it goes to a political insider whose primary allegiance is to the president. Mr. Daley, 62, who is not close to Mr. Obama even though both consider Chicago their base, has a well-rounded résumé. He has been a lawyer in private practice, a bank president, a telecommunications company executive, a political strategist, a fund-raiser and campaign chief, a lobbyist for foreign corporations (he advocated on tax matters for Nestlé and a Canadian petroleum company) and the commerce secretary in the Clinton administration for three years. His brother, Richard M. Daley, is departing after six terms as mayor of Chicago, where his family has an almost royal status. Mr. Obama, during a ceremony in the East Room on Thursday, cited that long list of jobs as part of the reason he picked Mr. Daley. “Few Americans can boast the breadth of experience that Bill brings to this job,” the president said, adding that he was “convinced that he’ll help us in our mission of growing our economy and moving America forward.” JPMorgan Chase has been Mr. Daley’s primary corporate home since 2004. He was hired, company officials said, as something of consolation prize to Chicago when Chase, which has its headquarters in New York, was taking over Bank One, which was based in Chicago. Chase executives, including Jamie Dimon, its chairman, wanted to bring in someone with Chicago connections who could smooth over relations with wealthy clients and corporations there. One Chase official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter, recalled, “A few bankers said we should hire a Bill Daley,” meaning someone with Chicago political connections and clout who could serve as a new public face for Chase. Mr. Dimon’s response was simple: “How about Bill Daley?” Mr. Daley started as chairman of Chase’s Midwest operations, but by 2007 he had expanded his portfolio, joining the bank’s senior leadership team as chief of its new Office of Corporate Social Responsibility, whose most important function was to oversee the company’s global lobbying efforts. At the time, Chase was trying to raise its profile in Washington. Senior company executives, including Mr. Dimon, began taking more trips to the capital to try to influence the terms of the TARP bailout — they pushed to make it easier for banks to repay the money — in 2008. Last year, Chase officials fought aspects of the historic revision of the nation’s financial regulations, including the creation of the consumer protection bureau. Mr. Daley was never registered as a lobbyist for Chase, but he played a role in hiring and was the direct supervisor of Peter L. Scher, another former Clinton administration official, who runs the bank’s lobbying shop in Washington. Mr. Daley also served as the bank’s chief liaison with the White House, frequently consulting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, and Rahm Emanuel, whom he is replacing. Mr. Daley’s salary is not public, but one person with knowledge of Chase’s executive compensation said that he has made $3 million to $5 million a year. He will be taking a considerable pay cut in accepting the $170,000-a-year White House post. Boeing, which is also based in Chicago, named Mr. Daley to its board in 2006, saying that his appointment would enhance its lobbying efforts and help promote international sales of its commercial planes and military equipment. In 2009, he earned $230,000 from Boeing in compensation and stock awards and $220,867 from Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Labs, like Boeing and Chase, has a long list of regulatory and legislative matters in play in Washington, like a tax in the health care bill that could cost medical-device makers like Abbott $20 billion over the next decade. A White House chief of staff is likely to be involved in discussions about repealing the legislation, as House Republicans have proposed, or aspects of it. Critics of Mr. Daley’s appointment said his corporate work would cause problems. They argue that he will have to recuse himself from matters relating to Chase, Abbott and Boeing or bow out of discussions involving financial regulations, health care and major Defense Department acquisitions, like the contract for a giant Air Force refueling tanker for which Boeing is competing. “These are all issues that come across the chief of staff’s desk,” said James A. Thurber, an American University professor and specialist on ethics and lobbying in Washington. “Is he going to stand outside of the flow as each of them heads to the president? I don’t see that, and if he doesn’t, there will the perception, and maybe the reality, of a conflict of interest.” Others dismiss such concerns as unfounded, saying that Mr. Daley, who is to start his new job as early as next week, would not make decisions on policy and would hardly have sole power over who sees the president. Supporters of the appointment say Mr. Daley’s diversity of experience is exactly what Mr. Obama needs — an experienced manager who can serve as an intermediary for the White House with various constituencies whose support is critical to the president. David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president who is leaving the White House soon, said Mr. Obama thought hard before naming his new top aide. “The chief is the only one in the administration who has as broad a responsibility as the president, and he’s the one who’s ultimately accountable to the president,” Mr. Axelrod said in an interview. “It is a very, very serious and consequential decision.” Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

Lehren and was written by Mr. Lipton.WASHINGTON — The king of Saudi Arabia wanted the United States to outfit his personal jet with the same high-tech devices as Air Force One. The president of Turkey wanted the Obama administration to let a Turkish astronaut sit in on a NASA space flight. And in Bangladesh, the prime minister pressed the State Department to re-establish landing rights at Kennedy International Airport in New York. Each of these government leaders had one thing in common: they were trying to decide whether to buy billions of dollars’ worth of commercial jets from Boeing or its European competitor, Airbus. And United States diplomats were acting like marketing agents, offering deals to heads of state and airline executives whose decisions could be influenced by price, performance and, as with all finicky customers with plenty to spend, perks. This is the high-stakes, international bazaar for large commercial jets, where tens of billions of dollars are on the line, along with hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs. At its heart, it is a wrestling match fought daily by executives at two giant companies, Boeing and Airbus, in which each controls about half of the global market for such planes. To a greater degree than previously known, diplomats are a big part of the sales force, according to hundreds of cables released by WikiLeaks, which describe politicking and cajoling at the highest levels. It is not surprising that the United States helps American companies doing business abroad, given that each sale is worth thousands of jobs and that their foreign competitors do the same. But like the other WikiLeaks cables, these offer a remarkably detailed look at what had previously been only glimpsed — in this case, the sales war between American diplomats and their European counterparts. The cables describe letters from presidents, state visits as bargaining chips and a number of leaders making big purchases based, at least in part, on how much the companies will dress up private planes. The documents also suggest that demands for bribes, or at least payment to suspicious intermediaries who offer to serve as “agents,” still take place. Boeing says it is committed to avoiding any such corrupt practices. State Department and Boeing officials, in interviews last month, acknowledged the important role the United States government plays in helping them sell commercial airplanes, despite a trade agreement signed by the United States and European leaders three decades ago intended to remove international politics from the process. The United States economy, said Robert D. Hormats, under secretary for economic affairs at the State Department, increasingly relies upon exports to the fast-growing developing world — nations like China and India, as well as those in Latin America and the Middle East. So pushing sales of big-ticket items like commercial jets, earth-moving equipment or power plants (or stepping in to object if an American company is not being given a fair chance to bid) is central to the Obama administration’s strategy to help the nation recover from the recession. Boeing earns about 70 percent of its commercial plane sales from foreign buyers, and is the single biggest exporter of manufactured goods in the United States. Every $1 billion in sales — and some of these deals carry a price tag of as high as $10 billion — translates into an estimated 11,000 American jobs, according to the State Department. The Equalizers “That is the reality of the 21st century; governments are playing a greater role in supporting their companies, and we need to do the same thing,” Mr. Hormats, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview. Said Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman, “The way I look at it, it levels the playing field.” But Charles A. Hamilton, a former Defense Department official who is a consultant to Airbus, said the government’s advocacy undermined arguments by Boeing and the United States that Airbus had an unfair advantage because of its subsidies from European governments. “The bottom line is anything goes to get the business,” said Mr. Hamilton, adding that he was speaking for himself, and not for Airbus. “If they feel like they are losing, they will do just about anything to save a deal.” Airbus executives would not discuss details of their own sales campaigns — and the WikiLeaks documents are mostly focused on American efforts. But one Airbus official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, conceded that, international agreements aside, “commercial jet sales are not totally decoupled from political relationship building.” One example of the horse-trading involved Saudi Arabia, which in November announced a deal with Boeing to buy 12 777-300ER airliners, with options for 10 more, a transaction worth more than $3.3 billion at list prices. That announcement was preceded by years of intense lobbying by American officials. One pitch came from the highest levels, the cables show. In late 2006, Israel Hernandez, a senior Commerce Department official, hand-delivered a personal letter from President George W. Bush to the Jeddah office of King Abdullah, urging the king to buy as many as 43 Boeing jets to modernize Saudi Arabian Airlines and 13 jets for the Saudi royal fleet, which serves the extended royal family. 1 2 Next Page » Eric Lipton reported from Washington, Nicola Clark from Paris and Andrew W.

The decision, which was more than a year in the making, does not represent a major financial risk for Airbus or its parent company, European Aeronautic Defense &amp; Space, analysts said. But it could still present a challenge for the plane maker in allocating engineering and manufacturing resources at a time when it is still working out assembly-line kinks with its two-deck A380 superjumbo jet and its future flagship, the A350, an all-composite twin-aisle plane scheduled for service in late 2013. The A320neo, which stands for New Engine Option, would provide “significant” fuel savings of up to 15 percent over current engines, Airbus said. It would also run more quietly with lower operating costs and be able to fly farther or carry a heavier payload while emitting less greenhouse gases. Two new engine choices are being developed for the A320neo — one by Pratt &amp; Whitney of the United States and the other by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran of France. Airbus also plans to equip the wing with large wing-tip devices known as “sharklets,” which the company said should result in at least 3.5 percent lower fuel burn over longer flights — but which will require structural reinforcements to the wing. The A320neo should be available in spring 2016, Airbus said. In recent months, Airbus and its main rival, Boeing, have been waging a war of nerves over who would announce plans to update their short-range planes. Boeing, based in Chicago, has been more cautious about getting into a major upgrade of the world’s best-selling jet airplane, the 737, as it faces delays with the 787 Dreamliner. The 737s and A320s, which typically seat 150 to 180 people, have formed the backbone of air travel for decades. While the 737 is currently the main competitor for the A320 jet family, analysts said Airbus’s decision was likely motivated more out of concern about the challenge posed by smaller rivals from Brazil, Canada, China and Japan. They are all developing their own jets with the same engines as the A320neo and up to 150 seats, bringing their capacity and fuel burn within striking distance of Airbus’s biggest money maker. “If Airbus didn’t do anything, there would have been quite a good chance that other nations — the most high profile being China — could start to gain market share,” said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst and managing partner at Agency Partners, a London brokerage firm. “By improving the plane’s economics to this degree, it’s probably enough to slam the door on the competition.” John Leahy, the top salesman at Airbus, had pressed hard for an A320 with a new engine to counter the C Series, a new aircraft from Bombardier of Canada, due to enter service in 2013, and China’s C919, which is expected in 2016. Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Virginia, said these new rivals posed a bigger threat to Airbus than to Boeing. “This is a necessary move for Airbus, and in the long term, quite a promising one,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “But there might be some upfront pain — like cannibalizing some of their own orders. The worst-case scenario would be that it doesn’t stimulate new orders but convinces people to wait and convert their existing ones. But still, I don’t think they had much choice.” Airbus has just over 200 orders for the current A320 with delivery dates in 2016 and beyond. Others warned that producing an upgraded plane would likely erode the portfolio value of the nearly 4,400 A320 line jets currently in service with airlines and leasing companies throughout the world. “It is hard to find too many people in the banking and finance world who think that the NEO is a good idea,” said Paul Sheridan, head of European risk at Ascend, an aviation consultancy in London. The upgraded plane, the A320neo, “runs the risk of getting stuck with the dreaded ‘interim’ label and will have poor residual value performance as a result.” Airlines in the United States and Europe appeared split over the benefits for updated versions of either plane. Some, like Southwest Airlines, one of Boeing’s biggest customers, have been asking for more efficient engines for years. Others, like Air France, have said they would prefer that plane makers develop an entirely new plane that would offer even bigger cost savings. On Wednesday, several carriers applauded Airbus’s decision, including Lufthansa of Germany, the Malaysian budget airline AirAsia, and IndiGo of India, saying they would study the new option. None, however, announced commitments to order the plane. Mr. Leahy said he expected to win “a couple of hundred” orders for the A320neo in 2011 and forecast demand for up to 4,000 A320neos over the next 15 years. That said, Airbus would not be actively pushing airlines to buy the upgraded plane, he said, which lists for just over $87 million, about $6 million more than the current version. “I expect the majority of A320 orders to be neos by middecade, but ultimately that is up to the market to decide,” Mr. Leahy said during an interview. “Remember, this is a new engine option — some airlines may still prefer to stick with the classic” version for operational and fleet-management reasons. During a recent interview, James F. Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a unit of Boeing, said his company was likely to hold off on an engine change and instead focus on having a new plane by 2020. He also played down suggestions that airlines wanted a more fuel-efficient plane before then. In any case, on Wednesday Boeing said that its current version of the 737, the 737NG, was already a step ahead of existing A320s in fuel efficiency, having achieved a 5 percent gain in fuel efficiency since it was first introduced in 1996. The company said that it expected to squeeze out a further 2 percent gain from those models by 2012. The U.S. jet maker also indicated that it had not yet shut the door on re-engining its narrow-body line, and would decide “based upon what our customers want.” Analysts said a new engine option for the 737 would likely be a bigger and more costly exercise for Boeing. “They have less room under the wing,” Mr. Cunningham of Agency Partners said. “They would need to do some more heavy re-engineering.” Accelerating development of an all-new single-aisle plane, however, would likely cost Boeing as much as $12 billion, Mr. Cunningham said. Nicola Clark reported from Paris and Jad Mouawad from New York.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/business/global/01airbus.html?ref=boeingcompany">Airbus Plans to Update A320 With New Engine<date>Published: November 30, 2010</date><text>After about a year of internal debates, Airbus has decided to build an updated version of its popular A320 single-aisle plane.An announcement could be made as early as Wednesday, after Airbus’s parent company, EADS, approved the program on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The new plane, known as the A320 NEO, which stands for New Engine Option, will feature a new geared turbo-fan engine that is expected to provide better fuel economy. It should be available in 2016. The decision, which would require an investment of about $1.5 billion, does not represent a major financial risk for Airbus or EADS. But it was postponed at least twice this year because of concerns that it might distract resources from the company’s flagship programs, the A380 superjumbo and the future A350, an all-composite twin-aisle plane scheduled for service in 2013. In particular, Airbus executives said they were wary of diverting too many engineers from their troubled projects into a new program. The new engines are being developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney and CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran of France. Airbus and EADS declined to comment. In recent months, Airbus and its main rival, Boeing, have been waging a war of nerves over who would announce plans to update their short-range planes.

Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a unit of Boeing, said his company was likely to hold off on the engine change and instead focus on having a new plane by 2020. He also played down suggestions that airlines wanted a more fuel-efficient plane before then. Meanwhile, John Leahy, Airbus’s top salesman, had pressed for an A320 with a new engine to counter the emergence of new competitors like Bombardier of Canada and Comac of China that threaten to encroach on the lucrative single-aisle jet market. These new rivals posed a bigger threat to Airbus than to Boeing, according to Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. “This is a necessary move for Airbus, and in the long term, quite a promising one,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “But there might be some upfront pain — like cannibalizing some of their own orders. The worst-case scenario would be that it doesn’t stimulate new orders but convinces people to wait and convert their existing ones. But still, I don’t think they had much choice.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/business/advertisingemail/01tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Air Force Moves to Fix Tanker Bidding Mistake<date>Published: November 30, 2010</date><text>The Air Force on Tuesday said it had tried to rectify a mixup over a $35 billion tanker contract by deliberately providing two rivals data about each other’s bid.A spokesman for the Air Force, Col. Les A. Kodlick, said the agency took that unusual step after it realized that one firm, the European Aeronautics Defense and Space Company, had opened a computer file containing some of the data but that its rival, Boeing, had not. The mixup, which started when the Air Force inadvertently sent each company the wrong data in November, has thrown the long-running effort to replace its aging aerial refueling tankers into turmoil again. The difference in how the companies handled the data, which emerged from interviews on Tuesday, has stoked Boeing’s concern about whether the process might be tainted. It hinted that it might file a formal protest. “Until we’re satisfied we have a complete picture, we’re keeping our options open for how we go forward,” said Daniel C. Beck, a Boeing spokesman. The Air Force said last week that it had reassigned two officials who mistakenly sent compact discs to the companies that contained government assessments of the refueling capacities of their rival’s planes. At the time, the Air Force said both companies had promptly reported the error and returned the discs and said it saw no reason to halt the bidding. Colonel Kodlick said Tuesday that forensic investigators had inspected computers at both companies. He said the inspections confirmed that Boeing’s employees had not opened a folder with the data about its competitor’s plane, while an EADS worker had “inadvertently opened” a file containing part of the government’s scoring of Boeing’s bid. The Air Force then sought to neutralize the difference by resending each firm the other’s data and inviting them to examine it, Colonel Kodlick said. The Air Force created formulas to compare the planes’ refueling capacities and costs. Mr. Beck, the Boeing spokesman, said that when two Boeing employees had initially inserted the disc into a laptop, they saw that the name of the folder referred to the EADS tanker. Mr. Beck said the employees “immediately removed the disc and locked it in a tamper-proof safe without opening any files or viewing any data on the disc.” Sean O’Keefe, the chief executive of EADS North America, told reporters last week that none of his workers had read documents containing information about Boeing’s bid. Mr. O’Keefe said Tuesday his worker had stopped at the first page. “As soon as we realized what we had, the disc was packed up and returned to the Air Force,” he said. Two earlier efforts to award the contract were nullified by accusations of corruption and questions about the bid evaluations.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/business/30boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Dreamliner Expected to Face a 6-Month Delivery Delay<date>Published: November 29, 2010</date><text>Market analysts on Monday projected a six-month delay in the first delivery of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and cut estimates of how quickly the company would increase production of the plane.The latest forecasts came in response to Boeing’s announcement last week that it expected to come up with a new delivery schedule over the next few weeks for the much-delayed plane. Boeing said it was working on design changes for power distribution panels after a recent fire forced a test plane to land in Texas. The fire, which lasted less than 30 seconds, was probably caused by debris left in a panel, the company said. The company, based in Chicago, said it would update the software that managed power distribution so the planes would not have to switch to backup power if a similar incident occurred. Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner, the first jetliner made primarily with lightweight carbon composites to slash fuel costs. It has attracted more advance orders — nearly 850 — than any plane in history. And as air travel rebounds from the recession, it should enable Boeing to overtake Airbus as the top jet maker. But Boeing has had to rebuild crucial parts from foreign suppliers. And analysts said that the problems, along with the changes prompted by the fire, were likely to add to the delays in the plane’s first delivery, which had been scheduled for February. “The status of the 787 is still in limbo, but a six-month delay seems like a reasonable first stab at how far the schedule might slide,” Joseph B. Nadol III, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note to clients. Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, also expected a six-month delay. Mr. Nadol reduced his estimate of the number of Dreamliners that Boeing would deliver in 2011 to 20, from 45. Mr. Stallard cut his to 10 planes, from 22. Mr. Stallard said the delays could have a cascading effect over the next several years, making it difficult for Boeing to reach its planned production rate of 10 Dreamliners a month by the end of 2013. Boeing executives have acknowledged that they outsourced too much of the design work, and production of the first 20 to 30 planes has been slowed by the need to rework many parts. David E. Strauss, an analyst at UBS, wrote Monday that November was the seventh consecutive month in which deliveries of structural components to Boeing’s 787 plant were below previous levels. The delays prompted Mr. Nadol and Mr. Stallard to make modest cuts in their estimates of Boeing’s earnings in 2011. Given all the problems, Boeing has projected that the Dreamliner could produce profit margins in the low single digits for perhaps the first 1,000 planes it sells, Mr. Nadol wrote. He said the jet was still likely to be profitable over that period, though the added costs were eating into that buffer. Other analysts said that if the Dreamliner lived up to its promise, Boeing could eventually sell several thousand planes.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/business/25boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Suspects Debris Caused Dreamliner Fire<date>Published: November 24, 2010</date><text>Boeing said Wednesday that the recent fire on a 787 Dreamliner was probably caused by debris in an electrical panel. And, as many analysts had speculated, it also announced that it would delay delivery of the first plane for safety changes.Boeing had planned to deliver the first 787, a passenger jet made substantially of lightweight carbon composites, next February. Lori Gunter, a company spokeswoman, said it was not clear how long the delivery would be delayed. Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner. It is supposed to cut fuel costs and has attracted nearly 850 advance orders, more than any plane in history. Boeing, based in Chicago, had said that a small fire broke out during a test flight on Nov. 8, forcing one of its six test planes to land in Texas. The company said Wednesday that the problem started with either a short circuit or an electrical arc in a power distribution panel. Boeing said that fault had most likely been sparked by the presence of a small foreign object. The panel receives power from the left engines and distributes it to other systems. Boeing has said the plane’s systems switched to backup power after the fire broke out. The company said it was updating the software that manages power distribution so that the plane would not switch to backup power if a similar incident occurred again. Even before the fire, stock analysts had been expecting further delays in the first delivery of the plane due to quality problems with suppliers. The plane is expected to make its debut at least three years late. Despite that, analysts say the new model should enable Boeing to overtake Airbus as the top jet maker in sales value.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/24tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Pentagon Reassigns 2 in Mix-Up Involving Tanker Data<date>Published: November 23, 2010</date><text>The top Air Force general said Tuesday that he had reassigned two officials who had mistakenly sent confidential data to the companies bidding for a $35 billion tanker contract.Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, said he could not identify the individuals given privacy rules. But he said they were involved in sending each bidder — Boeing and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, known as EADS — compact discs that contained data about the other’s proposal. General Schwartz said each disc contained just one page and did not include the prices that each side bid to build the aerial refueling planes. Other officials said that each company, instead of receiving information about how the Air Force evaluated the fuel-carrying capabilities of its plane, was given similar data on its rival. General Schwartz called the mix-up a “profound disappointment,” but said he saw no reason for it to derail the bid process. The Air Force has been trying for nearly a decade to replace hundreds of tankers that date from the Eisenhower era, and the process has repeatedly embarrassed the service. Its first effort to buy new tankers collapsed after corruption charges involving a leasing proposal with Boeing. Northrop Grumman and EADS, the parent of Airbus, then won in 2008, only to have the government block the award after Boeing protested. Northrop dropped out this year, leaving EADS to bid alone. Sean O’Keefe, the chief executive of EADS North America, told reporters on Monday that he thought the mistake had been properly handled by both companies, which promptly returned the discs to the Air Force. But he said he could not rule out filing a protest. Boeing has declined to comment on the error. Some analysts said the mistake could increase the odds that the Air Force might divide the contract between two companies rather than risk another time-consuming protest. General Schwartz said the Pentagon was opposed to splitting the contract. James McAleese, a lawyer who advises military companies, said the data that was mistakenly supplied probably verified what both companies expected — that the larger EADS plane could carry more fuel. But that would most likely be offset by lower operating costs for the Boeing jet. And, he said, both companies could still drop their prices 10 to 15 percent in a final bid round.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/business/21tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Air Force Slip Gives EADS and Boeing Each Other’s Data<date>Published: November 21, 2010</date><text>The Air Force has made another potentially serious mistake in its effort to buy $35 billion of aerial tankers, by accidentally sending each bidder sensitive data about the other’s proposal, Pentagon officials said Saturday.Officials said both companies, Boeing and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, promptly returned the information, and the Air Force plans to continue the bidding. But industry consultants said the mistake could provide the loser with grounds to protest the contract, delaying a decade-long push to replace refueling planes from the Eisenhower era. “This seals the deal that this contract award will not be the last word,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. Col. Les A. Kodlick, an Air Force spokesman, said a clerical error resulted in “limited amounts” of information being sent to each company about the other’s bid. Colonel Kodlick said that contractors had an obligation not to use another’s proprietary data and that the Air Force believed the data was returned quickly enough to avoid compromising the process. It plans to award the contract early next year. The error was reported by Defense News, a trade publication. Other officials said that each company, instead of receiving data about how the Air Force evaluated the fuel-carrying capabilities of its plane, was given similar information on its rival. The Air Force’s first effort to replace the tankers collapsed after corruption charges involving a leasing proposal with Boeing. Northrop Grumman and EADS, the parent of Airbus, then won in 2008, only to have the government block the award after Boeing protested. Northrop dropped out earlier this year, leaving EADS to bid alone. The award of the contract is also highly political, with thousands of jobs at stake in Washington State, where Boeing would assemble its planes, or Alabama, where EADS would build a factory if it won the contract. The Air Force has tried to make the scoring as objective as possible, creating formulas to compare the planes’ cargo-carrying capabilities, operating expenses and the cost of building new hangers and runways for them. The EADS tanker, which is based on an A330 commercial airplane, is larger than Boeing’s tanker, based on its 767 jets. Most analysts expected the EADS plane to score more highly on fuel and cargo capacity, while Boeing’s jet was likely to be cheaper to house and operate. As a result, analysts have said that the bidding would come down to a final shootout over which company would offer the lowest price. News of the error in sending the firms each other’s data already has the Congressional delegations from Washington and Alabama on guard, with members from both states demanding more information from the Air Force about what happened.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/business/21shelf.html?ref=boeingcompany">‘Turbulence’ Traces Change at Boeing - Off the Shelf<date>Published: November 20, 2010</date><text>ONCE upon a time, major American companies and their employees treated each other as family. The companies provided job security and lifelong benefits; in general, workers were loyal and engaged in their jobs, the occasional strike notwithstanding.But that relative harmony ended with the advent of globalization, according to “Turbulence: Boeing and the State of American Workers and Managers” (Yale University Press, 238 pages), a meticulous and illuminating case study of the nation’s largest manufacturing exporter. The book has four authors with a combination of academic and private-sector backgrounds: Edward S. Greenberg, Leon Grunberg, Sarah Moore and Patricia B. Sikora. Based on their research and experience, they write: “The very innovations and changes Boeing introduced to remain a leading producer of airplanes — altered management strategies, pervasive technological changes, extensive outsourcing, broad global partnerships, massive layoffs, and drastically altered ways of working — produced stress and turbulence in the lives of workers and managers alike.” And the authors say Boeing’s woes are a cautionary tale for corporate America because the company suffered despite extraordinary advantages. “As one of only two manufacturers of large passenger jets in the world, Boeing occupies an extraordinary economic niche, and has had generally enlightened policies, along with strong unions to protect its employees,” the authors write. “Many American companies and their employees, in virtually every economic sector, face similarly strong competitive pressures but without Boeing’s advantages.” The book focuses mainly on the period from 1996 to 2006, a span that encompassed the company’s merger with McDonnell Douglas, a strike by engineers and technical workers, ethics scandals in top management ranks, and the start of a major new passenger jet project, the 787 Dreamliner. The research included four separate surveys, in 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006. They tracked a cohort of 525 continuously employed Boeing workers and managers as well as scores of people who left the company during the course of the study. After generally worsening between the first and the third surveys, employee attitudes toward the company showed some improvement by the 2006 poll, as some of Boeing’s changes took root. But according to the authors, morale issues remained. One of the book’s most notable findings has to do with outsourcing. As seen in the production of the 787 Dreamliner, its new wide-body jet, the effects were decidedly double-edged. Two aims of the outsourcing were to cut costs and to gain access to more foreign markets; both of those goals were largely achieved. But the parts contracts for the 787 were let to 135 sites in two dozen countries. In theory, the parts could be snapped and fitted together — much like pieces of a model airplane — at the Boeing plant in Everett, Wash. Yet in practice, the authors say, the process proved much more complicated, “something Boeing discovered to its considerable discomfort in 2008 and 2009 when many of the sections neither snapped nor fit properly.”) Production of the 787 would fall two years behind schedule. Many survey respondents worried that outsourcing would result in “the bleeding of engineering knowledge and jobs to global partner companies, hurting both Boeing and the United States in the long run,” the book says. One engineer with 27 years of experience at Boeing opined that “we are giving away the farm.” The authors found that the decision by top management to emulate the so-called “team” model, pioneered by Japanese companies like Toyota, had a generally negative effect on employee morale rather than promoting a sense of empowerment. The authors write that “perhaps more in sorrow than in anger,” many people said that “the notion of Boeing as a family, where employees’ contributions were respected as a source of competitive advantage, was a thing of the past, replaced by Boeing as a team where people and positions were expendable or interchangeable with other workers around the world.” Perhaps even more surprising was how disaffection with the changes at Boeing permeated every level of the company. “Importantly, at the end of our study period, there was no statistical difference between the number of managers and nonmanagers regarding their intentions to quit Boeing,” the authors report, later adding that “as the organization flattened, the career ladder became compressed to a step-stool; many managers and employees felt dead-ended as opportunities for advancement seemed to evaporate.” FOR an academic study, “Turbulence” is refreshingly accessible, with a coherent narrative punctuated by no more than the minimally requisite charts, and only occasionally marred by overworking a comparison of the company-employee relationship to a failed marriage. The interview excerpts are often heart-wrenching, and the long-term, disciplined nature of the authors’ research gives their findings credibility. For these reasons alone, “Turbulence” should be required reading for anyone at a major American corporation, especially in top management. Arguably, the single glaring weakness is in the book’s prescription for fixing the workplace. Insisting that neither companies nor employees can go it alone, the authors call for government to protect American workers and provide employment opportunities through “safety net programs based on pooled-risk insurance principles.” That may sound like an ideal combination of the family model and the team model. But given the outcome of the recent midterm elections, any proposal to enlarge the role of government in the private sector is not something the American public is likely to buy into anytime soon.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/business/global/17plane.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing and Airbus Waver on Upgrading the 737 and A320<date>Published: November 16, 2010</date><text>The latest high-stakes maneuvering by Boeing and Airbus does not involve their top-of-the-line models, the 787 Dreamliner and the A380 jumbo jet, but instead their aging smaller workhorses.The two companies have long been defined by their willingness to take big risks. But perhaps because of all the problems and costs involved with the bigger planes, they have turned more cautious in responding to pressure from the airlines to develop more fuel-efficient substitutes for their smaller planes, the 737 and A320. Aviation experts say breakthroughs in engine technology offer a rare chance to re-engineer the two companies’ narrow 737s and A320s, which make up three-fourths of the fleets at the largest airlines. But while the new engines could save the airlines hundreds of millions of dollars a year, Airbus would have to invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion — and Boeing possibly twice that — to test and install them on the jets. And that, both companies say, would force them to push back plans to design brand-new versions of the planes, which would eventually offer even greater cost savings. James F. Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a unit of Boeing, said in an interview that his company was likely to hold off on the engine change and instead create a new plane by 2020. Airbus officials said their top executives were divided about what to do and planned to decide soon. Most analysts say they think Airbus will install the new engines and streamline the A320 by 2015 to take sales from Boeing while it is working out its new design. But with oil prices back above $80 a barrel, airline executives say that they had hoped to hear cheerier news about faster solutions. The 737s and A320s, which each typically seat 150 to 180 people, have formed the backbone of the air travel system for decades. More than 10,000 of them shuttle passengers between major airports within the United States and other continents. But in terms of fuel economy, “we haven’t seen substantial improvements since the 1990s,” said Michael G. Van de Ven, the chief operating officer of Southwest Airlines, one of Boeing’s biggest customers. And with ticket prices rising, he said, “If there is one single thing that you can do to improve the economics in this industry, that is to introduce a new airplane.” Boeing and Airbus say they are under too much financial strain from delays on the larger planes to jump right into designing a new jet, which could cost $7 billion to $10 billion. Mr. Albaugh, the Boeing executive, said that given the choice of new engines in five years or a whole new plane in 10, most airlines would prefer to wait. While the engines could help cut the operating costs for a new plane by 15 percent, he said, modifications and other costs in adding them to the 737s could reduce the total savings to less than 5 percent. “A lot of people will say, ‘Yeah, go re-engine the plane,’ ” Mr. Albaugh said. “But the second question is, Would you buy it?” Airbus could save even more in a plane’s total operating costs — analysts estimate 7 to 10 percent — by using the new engines and taking other steps to streamline the A320. But top Airbus officials said last month that they were concerned about whether they had enough engineers to handle all the work in front of them. The companies’ ambivalence about installing new engines on the existing planes — which is essentially a stopgap measure — also illustrates how “the great Airbus-Boeing game is changing,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. While dominating the market for large commercial planes over the last two decades, the two companies have loved nothing more than to leapfrog each other with bold technological advances. But even as the demand for new planes bounces back from the recession, both are finding themselves hamstrung by the need to solve their production problems, Mr. Aboulafia said. Boeing is nearly three years late in delivering its most important plane, the 787 Dreamliner, the first jetliner made substantially of lightweight carbon composites that are also supposed to slash fuel costs. A fire on a test flight last week reinforced expectations among analysts for further delays in its first deliveries next year. Airbus said last week that it was pushing the delivery date for the A350 XWB, its answer to the Dreamliner, to late 2013 from mid-2013. Airbus might have to make more changes in its A380 jumbo jet after debris spewed from an engine during a Qantas Airways flight on Nov. 4. Boeing and Airbus also have to worry about new competitors from Canada, China and Russia. They are taking advantage of the new engine technologies to design planes that could cut into the sales of 737s and A320s over the next few years. The new engines are being developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, and CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Snecma of France. Pratt &amp; Whitney’s would have a huge fan and an advanced gear box to provide thrust with less fuel. CFM’s rival engine would have improvements in its core to provide similar gains.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/business/global/16qantas.html?ref=boeingcompany">A380 Engine Shortage Seen as Many Are Replaced<date>Published: November 15, 2010</date><text>PARIS — Airline industry executives said Monday that an extensive inspection and replacement program of Rolls-Royce engines on their Airbus A380 fleets could potentially lead to a shortage of available spares.The concerns follow Rolls-Royce’s recommendation last Friday that the three airlines currently flying A380s fitted with its Trent 900 jet engines — Qantas Airways, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa — replace a specific turbine component after an oil fire was determined to have caused an engine to explode on a Qantas flight earlier this month. That flight, carrying more than 450 people, was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore. “There are currently very intense discussions going on with Rolls-Royce and Airbus that focus on how new engines would be sourced,” said one airline executive who asked not to be identified because the discussions were continuing. An executive at another carrier said that because it was not yet clear how quickly the required replacements of the affected component could be made, it was difficult to determine the effect on the 20 A380s currently in service with Rolls-Royce engines. “There may be enough of a shortage of spares now that engines may have to be taken off aircrafts that are still on the production line” at Airbus, the executive said. Such a move could have consequences for airlines that had been expecting to receive new A380s next year. Qantas, which operates six of the four-engine superjumbo planes, may need to remove as many as 14 engines — more than half of the total — as it carries out the recommended checks, said one person who had been briefed on the situation. “Some of those engines will be put back on fairly quickly, but inevitably others will need to be deconstructed and all will eventually need to have the affected module replaced,” said the person, who requested anonymity because the investigation was still continuing. So far, Qantas has said publicly that it would remove and refurbish just three of its A380 engines on which oil leaks had been discovered in the wake of the Nov. 4 accident. Asked about the reports, representatives from Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa all declined to comment. Josh Rosenstock, a Rolls-Royce spokesman in London, also declined to comment. Rolls-Royce has declined to identify the component that failed on the Qantas flight earlier this month. But according to one person who had been briefed on the matter, investigators isolated a problem in an air-transfer tube in the cavity between the engine’s high- and intermediate-pressure turbines. Rolls-Royce is preparing a replacement program for the component, known as Module 51, said the person, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the subject. Mr. Rosenstock declined to say how long it might take to deliver all of the needed replacement modules. At least 80 of them would be required to repair the current fleet of affected planes, not including spares or engines which are currently still on Airbus assembly lines in France and Germany. Thomas O. Enders, the chief executive of Airbus, said last week that the need for spare engines could disrupt the timing of new A380 deliveries in the early part of 2011, though he said it was not yet clear how severe the delays could be. Airbus is scheduled to deliver three more A380s to Qantas before the end of this year. One more A380 is also slated for 2010 delivery, but it is fitted with engines built by the Engine Alliance — a joint venture between General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/business/11boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Fire on Boeing 787 Dreamliner Halts Test Flights<date>Published: November 10, 2010</date><text>Boeing halted test flights on Wednesday of its 787 Dreamliner, a day after an onboard fire forced an emergency landing, reinforcing expectations that the long-awaited plane faced more delays.Several analysts said they doubted that Boeing, which is counting on the jet to vault it past Airbus in total sales, would meet its plan to deliver the first 787 by February. The plane, the first passenger jet made substantially with lightweight carbon composites that are supposed to greatly cut fuel costs, is already running nearly three years late. And given other recent problems with suppliers and a test engine, some analysts said, Boeing might be able to deliver only about two dozen of the planes next year, down from earlier estimates of 40 to 50 or more. “There will be another delay,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. Even if the fire had not occurred on the test plane, “there would still be another delay,” he said. “There are still too many unknowns.” Boeing said Wednesday that it was evaluating what had gone wrong on the test flight and had suspended flights for its six test planes. Company officials said smoke entered the cabin from an electronics compartment in the rear of the plane, forcing an emergency landing in Laredo, Tex. Forty-two engineers and crew members were aboard. One suffered minor injuries in evacuating by slide. Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner, which has attracted more advance orders — 847 — than any plane in history. Its shares fell 3.2 percent, to $67.07 a share, in trading on Wednesday. Boeing said in a statement that it appeared that a power control panel in the electronics compartment would need to be replaced, and other repairs might be necessary. It said it would take several days to analyze data from the test flight to determine the severity of the problem. Boeing added that it “cannot determine the impact of this event on the overall program schedule until we have worked our way through the data.” The Federal Aviation Administration, which must certify new planes as safe, is also investigating what caused the fire. Hans J. Weber, an independent safety consultant, said if the fire stemmed from a flaw in basic electrical components, the problem could be relatively easy to fix. But if it were linked to more advanced electrical controls that help the Dreamliner save fuel, that could require more time-consuming changes. The plane’s development has been marred by persistent problems with Boeing’s far-flung supply network. Company executives have acknowledged that they farmed out too much design and production work and did not initially keep close enough tabs on suppliers. But even though they have made an all-out push to meet their latest delivery schedule, more problems have cropped up over the last several months. A Rolls-Royce engine meant to be used in one of the 787 test planes failed in a test plant in Britain in August, spewing out debris. Boeing cited that engine problem in saying it would push back delivery of the first Dreamliner for the fifth time, from late this year to February 2011. Rolls-Royce has said it is confident it can fix the engine by that date. Rolls-Royce also said this week that the problem on the engine for Boeing did not seem to be related to the failure last week of another Rolls-Royce engine on an Airbus A380 jumbo jet. That engine jettisoned debris while the plane, operated by Qantas Airways, was in flight. Boeing has had to tell suppliers around the world to halt parts deliveries three times this year because Alenia Aeronautica, a unit of Finmeccanica of Italy, could not deliver the 787’s horizontal tails on time. The latest parts delay occurred in late October. Boeing officials have said that poor workmanship by Alenia and other suppliers forced Boeing to rework many parts, further slowing its production line. Alenia agreed last week to fix the problems by year-end. Mr. Aboulafia, the Teal Group analyst, said he doubted that Boeing would be ready to deliver the first Dreamliner before the second quarter of 2011. Robert Spingarn, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that before the fire broke out on the test plane, he had also concluded that the first delivery was not likely until April. With all the reworking of parts, he said, “the aircraft, at this point, is being hand-built.” He said Boeing knew there was “an important statement to be made” in delivering that first plane as soon as possible. But he said that Boeing still had so many fixes to make on the next 20 to 25 planes that it would be hard pressed to deliver more than 27 planes next year. Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note earlier this week that Boeing executives told him on Monday that assembly of many of the first 30 aircraft would take longer than expected. Mr. Stallard said he now expected Boeing to deliver only 24 of the planes in 2011. He said Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., who was at the meeting, believed that the company would probably need to build 40 to 50 Dreamliners before overcoming all the potential problems. Still, investors have been patient with Boeing over the delays. It still has a two- to three-year edge over Airbus in building more fuel-efficient carbon planes, and the demand for new planes is strong as airlines emerge from the recession.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/business/10boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing 787 Makes Emergency Landing<date>Published: November 9, 2010</date><text>A Boeing 787 jetliner on a test flight over Texas made an emergency landing Tuesday after smoke was detected in the main cabin.The plane landed safely in Laredo and the crew was evacuated, a Boeing spokeswoman, Loretta Gunter, said.

The smoke appeared in the rear cabin of the plane, farthest from the cockpit, said Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. “The pilot landed and advised he was declaring an emergency,” said Mr. Lunsford, who added that the airport fire department had been called to the scene. He said the F.A.A. would look into the incident. The 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner, is made of composite material intended to make it lighter and more fuel-efficient, but Boeing has run into a series of delays in developing the big, two-aisle passenger plane. Boeing has said it will deliver the first production models of the 787 to Japan’s All Nippon Airways in the middle of the first quarter of next year — about three years behind schedule. It was unclear whether Tuesday’s incident would add to the delays.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/05defense.html?ref=boeingcompany">Wealthy and Worried, India Is Rich Arms Market<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>A big item on President Obama’s India to-do list this weekend is securing a $5 billion deal for Boeing to sell 10 of its C-17 cargo planes.The agreement, for which Boeing and American officials have long laid the groundwork, would be part of a flurry of military equipment deals that foreign suppliers are eager to nail down with India. Mr. Obama’s French and Russian counterparts are expected to visit New Delhi this year, with their own military sales contracts in hand. India, flush with new wealth but worried about its national security, is rapidly turning into one of the world’s most lucrative arms markets. In the last several years, as its budget and appetite for more sophisticated weaponry have grown, India has reduced its traditional reliance on Russia for planes, ships and missiles. The White House is backing sales like the C-17s, which India would use to transport its rapid-response forces, to help make India a regional counterweight to China. But there is a big trade motive, too. As the United States and European nations trim military spending, the biggest weapons contractors, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, see India as a sales lifeline. Still, American companies face complex political and bureaucratic obstacles to gaining a large part of India’s business. The president’s trip will be focused in part on trying to cut through some of those problems. Perhaps the biggest concern is Indian leaders’ wariness about relying too much on the United States, which they see as a new, untested military partner, and one that is also arming Pakistan, India’s main adversary. In India, the United States “starts with a handicap” on arms sales, said K. Raja Menon, a retired admiral who is chairman of an Indian government task force that studies security risks. India’s accelerating economy gives it the resources to join Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the biggest arms buyers. And its desire to upgrade its military was spurred by the terror attacks in Mumbai in late 2008, when militants slipped in by sea and killed 160 people. “There’s nothing to galvanize the psyche of the Indian people toward better defense and homeland security than what happened in Mumbai,” said Tom Captain, who leads the aerospace and defense group at Deloitte, the global consultancy. Mr. Captain and other analysts estimate that, as its military budget expands by 7 percent to 8 percent annually, India could spend $50 billion to $80 billion in the next five years on equipment. Besides the Pakistan issue, Indian military officials say that trade sanctions imposed after India conducted nuclear tests in 1998 have also put the United States at a disadvantage. Most of the sanctions, which prohibited military exports to India and exports to Indian companies believed to be involved in the nuclear program, were repealed in 2001. But the sanctions have left concerns about Americans. “There is an entrenched view in bureaucracies in India that these guys will turn off the tap,” said Mr. Menon, the retired admiral. Indian officials are also upset that other technology controls remain in place, including bans on the sale of software that could also be used for weapons. The officials will press Mr. Obama to ease those strictures. Another sticking point could be that India has balked at signing agreements to protect American secrets that are a standard part of any sales. India also uses the lure of big military contracts to require foreign companies to farm out work to Indian companies and create high-paying jobs there. But India’s fledging military industries cannot handle all the work, and American officials want more flexibility in those arrangements. At the same time, American analysts say that India’s military spending process is so chaotic and unfocused that it is proving difficult to complete deals. “India at the moment has the money to buy weapons, but behind this there is not much strategic direction,” said Stephen P. Cohen, an analyst with the Brookings Institution. Still, India’s plan to modernize its military is so sweeping that industry officials say there should be plenty of business to go around. “All I can say is that the market potential here is so significant that there is room for various countries and companies,” said Vivek Lall, the vice president in charge of Boeing’s military business in India. One of the biggest prizes would be a $10 billion contract to replace old Russian fighter planes with 126 new jets. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and four companies from Europe and Russia have bid, and the contract could be awarded next year. Mr. Obama is likely to talk up the American companies during his visit, just as Nicolas Sarkozy of France and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia are expected to make pitches for their manufacturers when they visit India. American companies are also bidding on major contracts involving helicopters and missile systems, while some earlier deals are coming to fruition. Lockheed Martin, for example, is about to deliver the first of six C-130J cargo planes that India ordered for $1 billion in 2007. Boeing, meanwhile, is building maritime surveillance planes under a $2.1 billion contract awarded in early 2009. But American executives say they realize that success in India will depend on how well they can unite with Indian companies, a process that could help them win more political support. Several American contractors have created joint ventures with a government-owned company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Boeing signed a 10-year, $1 billion deal with the Indian company in 2007. Hindustan is making parts for Boeing’s 777 commercial jets and for planes it is building for the Pentagon and India. And the Tata Group, India’s largest business conglomerate, is expected to deliver the first Indian-made cabins for the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter in November. Bharat Wakhlu, the resident director of Tata in New Delhi, said labor costs in India were one-eighth or less than in the United States. So even though productivity levels are lower, he said, the American companies can still realize significant savings by moving work there. American officials, however, say that Indian rules limiting foreign contractors to minority stakes in joint ventures, and requiring them to spend 30 percent of any contract money on work in India, are too onerous. But as long as India’s economy is booming, American arms suppliers may still make big gains. The cost of weapons is simply not as much a factor as it was just a few years ago, when India relied mainly on Russia for military equipment, said Gurmeet Kanwal, a retired brigadier and the director of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, a research organization in New Delhi. American technology is seen as the “top of the top,” he said, and “we should aim to pay a little more for the best equipment.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/global/05engine.html?ref=boeingcompany">In Qantas Engine Blowout, Concern for Rolls-Royce<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>The blowout of an engine on Qantas Flight 32 on Thursday was the latest in a series of problems involving Rolls-Royce engines and analysts said it raised serious questions about the company’s ability to develop the engines for the newest generation of commercial and military airplanes.The episode, involving a Qantas A380 jetliner carrying more than 450 people, was particularly alarming because it occurred on the world’s largest passenger plane and a flagship program for Airbus, a unit of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS. Rolls-Royce of London, which is a separate company from the carmaker owned by BMW, is also developing an engine for Boeing’s latest aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner. Problems with that engine have contributed to the program’s delays. “This is extremely worrying for Rolls-Royce,” said Phil Abbott, editor of Aircraft Engines, a London-based industry newsletter. “There is no such thing as a shoddy engine maker. But the moment engines fly to bits, no one wants to fly them anymore.” The pressure on Rolls-Royce intensified on Friday when Qantas’s CEO, Alan Joyce, said the mid-air engine failure on Flight 32 may have been caused by material failure or a design problem with the engines. Mr. Joyce said it was still too early to determine a cause for the failure but he rejected concerns from a labor union that it may have been caused by insufficient maintenance, a responsibility of the airline. “We believe this is probably, most likely, a material failure or some sort of design issue,” Mr. Joyce said at a news conference in Sydney, Australia. “We don’t believe this is related to maintenance in any way.” Passengers from Flight 32 were being flown to Australia on Friday, and were expected to arrive in Sydney in the evening. At his new conference, Mr. Joyce said Qantas, Airbus and Rolls-Royce were examining the engines on all of the airline’s A380s, a check expected to be completed this weekend. The airline’s fleet of six A380s remained grounded on Friday, but Mr. Joyce said that if no problems are found the A380s would resume flying, he said. In at least two previous cases during the past year, two A380 airplanes with Trent 900 engines from Rolls-Royce were forced to land after an engine failure. In August, a Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 test engine developed for Boeing blew up during a ground test. Rolls-Royce has also faced problems with its military engines, where it has teamed with General Electric to build an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Both companies are battling to keep the Pentagon from canceling the project. They disclosed in late September that one of their test engines had experienced an anomaly that damaged the airfoils. Pratt &amp; Whitney has the main contract to build engines for the fighter, and the government sales could reach $100 billion over 25 years. Modern engines are designed to contain a blowout inside the engine’s casing so that broken parts are not sprayed at high speed into the fuselage or the wings, where the fuel tanks are located. But in the case of Flight 32, parts of the engine were blown away and appeared to rupture the wing. An Airbus spokesman in France said it was the first uncontained engine failure and the most serious problem experienced by the A380 since it entered service in 2007. The double-decker A380 airplanes fly with four engines, which are developed either by Rolls-Royce or Engine Alliance, a joint venture between G.E. and Pratt. All the engine failures on A380s have so far involved Roll-Royce engines, analysts said. In a statement, the company said it was cooperating with investigators. “This is at a very early stage, and it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions at this time.” Robert W. Mann Jr., an aviation industry expert in Port Washington, N.Y., said that the concern with Flight 32 was that the debris was not contained by the engine casing. “An uncontained failure is the most serious because it causes collateral damage,” he said. There are 37 A380s in service, 20 with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. Three airlines operate with the Trent 900: Qantas, which has six; Lufthansa, three; and Singapore Airlines, 11. Emirates Airline, which operates 13 A380s, and Air France, which has four in service, use the GP7200 engine developed by the G.E.-Pratt joint venture. Rolls-Royce’s problems also raise questions about the newest plane being developed by Airbus, the A350, made out of composite material and meant to compete with the 787 from Boeing. Unlike most aircraft programs — including the A380 and the 787, which are built with two engine options — the A350 will be configured with only one engine, the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB. While the A380 program has not been a big commercial success for Airbus, the company has much more at stake with the A350. Airbus has 234 orders for the A380, but it already has 573 orders for the A350, which it expects to put into service in 2013. “You design an aircraft around an engine, and the aircraft’s performance depends upon its engine,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. “The real issue is Rolls-Royce’s reputation as a development company. They promised an awful lot with the A350. There is a lot riding on that engine and on that plane, whose performance is entirely dependent on Rolls-Royce.” Airbus declined to comment about the impact of Thursday’s episode on the development of the A350. One expert suggested on Thursday that Rolls-Royce might have stretched technological limits with its latest Trent engines in the race to provide better efficiency. “I think it is possible that one of the problems Rolls-Royce is experiencing over all is that they may have lost a little bit of margin in the design of their engines,” said Hans Weber, the president of Tecop International, an aviation consulting firm in San Diego. “We are pushing harder to the limits because we are forced to increase the efficiency.”</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/business/global/19subsidies.html?ref=boeingcompany">Aviation World at Odds Over Loans for Aircraft<date>Published: October 18, 2010</date><text>Back in the mid-1980s, Boeing and Airbus avoided a trade war by making a gentlemen’s agreement not to seek government financing to sell planes in each other’s home markets. The deal symbolized an aviation world dominated by the United States and Europe.That world is a lot different now. No longer can Airbus and Boeing count on being the biggest manufacturers of large airplanes. Manufacturers in Canada and Brazil are seeking to gain a foothold in this lucrative market. And not too far in the future, China, Japan and Russia will be competing as well. At the same time, airlines from Asia and the Middle East that did not exist three decades ago, or were small players, are now vying for a much bigger piece of the global aviation market. The old rules, some airlines and plane manufacturers contend, are not working anymore. This week, negotiators from the European Union and countries including the United States, Japan and Brazil will meet in Ottawa to grapple with the politically charged issue. Their goal is to draw up a new agreement by the end of the year on the rules for financing the airplane business — and specifically, how much government assistance is permitted. The various interests are in conflict, and it is unclear if the talks will be successful. “The home market restriction has become unsustainable,” said Scott Scherer, vice president for strategic regulatory policy at Boeing’s financing unit. “It’s the big elephant in the room.” The discussions, which are taking place under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are complicated by the fact that what might be in the interest of the airlines may not necessarily work for aircraft manufacturers. The so-called home market rule applies to only four European countries — France, Germany, Britain and Spain — where Airbus planes are produced, and to the United States, where Boeing is based. As a result, for example, Ryanair, which is based in Dublin and is one of Europe’s biggest low-cost carriers, has tapped into export-credit financing to buy most of its fleet of 200 Boeing planes. Its London-based rival, EasyJet, cannot make a similar deal. The loudest objections to the current rules have come from European airlines, which say that cheaper, government-backed loans have helped fuel the growth of their rivals in Asia and the Middle East and given them an unfair advantage. The charge is mostly aimed at Emirates Airlines in Dubai, whose rapid expansion in recent years has rattled airlines in Britain, France and Germany. The airline threatens to take their international passengers away from European hubs and fly them instead through its gleaming new terminals in Dubai. Boeing and Airbus also worry about new competition. At the moment, their biggest concern is the emergence of a new jet from Bombardier of Canada, the C-Series. This single-aisle plane, due to enter service in 2013, will be able to seat about 130 passengers, posing a direct challenge for the first time to the best-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The current rules set separate financing standards for large airplanes and regional jets with 100 or fewer seats. But the C-Series, with its larger capacity and range, has now blurred that line, Boeing and Airbus say. This, they argue, puts them at a competitive disadvantage for sales in the single-aisle category, the most profitable segment of the market. Bombardier said it would welcome a new arrangement where airlines could obtain financing, regardless of where they were based. “We do not support the so-called home market rule,” Marc Meloche, the senior director for structured finance at Bombardier Aerospace, said. “All customers should have access to all financing sources, based on market principles." Besides the Canadian factor, the other major catalyst for the talks has been the economic downturn, which essentially shut down commercial credit markets and left official export agencies, especially the Export-Import Bank of the United States, as outsize purveyors of financing. In 2009, about 35 percent of Boeing and Airbus sales were financed by credit agencies, according to the manufacturers, up from about 20 percent before the economic downturn. In the United States, the Export-Import bank guaranteed $8.6 billion in commercial aviation loans in its fiscal year ending September 2009, nearly double what it typically helped finance each year since 2002. This year, export credit agencies in the United States and Europe are expected to guarantee more than $15 billion in civil aviation loans, about the same as in 2009. Export agencies, set up to help finance exports to countries with weaker credit, usually require quicker repayment than commercial loans and impose more restrictions on the airlines. But in today’s depressed market, industry experts say, the agencies’ loans are on average about three to five percentage points lower than commercial loans. This can be a significant factor for planes whose list price ranges from $60 million for a single-aisle plane to about $350 million for the largest plane today, the Airbus A380.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/business/01boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing to Delay Delivery of 747-8 Freighter Jet<date>Published: September 30, 2010</date><text>The Boeing Company said Thursday that it would delay delivery of the 747-8 freighter, its biggest commercial jet, until mid-2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010.The widely expected setback follows an August announcement that Boeing would push back first delivery of its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner to the first quarter of 2011.

Most industry analysts agreed that Europe, which had been cited earlier, had used more blatant and aggressive types of subsidies to help Airbus overtake Boeing as the world’s top plane maker. But the newest developments will most likely add to the acrimony, making it harder for the two sides to end the practices, especially as new threats emerge from state-sponsored competitors in China and Russia. “It would be nice to live in a world of unicorns where they could come up with an international framework that globally regulated government support,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. As long as aircraft manufacturing remains a source of national pride and high-paying jobs, “politicians on both sides will give till it hurts,” he said. The trade case started in 2005, when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that European countries had given Airbus more than $20 billion in questionable aid, including $15 billion in low-interest loans to develop its jetliners. Boeing’s supporters cheered last June when a W.T.O. panel finally ruled that Airbus had used the loans, known as launch aid, to steal sales from Boeing. The panel concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times that it did,” without the subsidies. But European officials countersued, and in a twist, the trade organization issued a preliminary ruling on Wednesday that found that Boeing had received at least $5 billion in federal research contracts and other subsidies that violated trade rules. Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr. , said Thursday he was “heartened” by the decisions. “There was nothing like direct launch aid that was found in their case found in ours, so the proportionality remains pretty significantly different,” he said. But while Mr. Aboulafia agreed with Boeing’s view that the European aid seemed more brazen, he said that the American company would still have a tough time making that case politically. Analysts said Boeing had hoped to use the trade case to block Airbus’s expansion. Both Mr. Aboulafia and Scott Hamilton, who runs the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Issaquah, Wash., said that Boeing was trying to slow Airbus’s drive to develop a plane to compete with its best-selling new 787 Dreamliner, the first commercial jetliner made substantially from lightweight carbon composites. And Boeing’s supporters have cited the ruling against Airbus in urging the Pentagon to keep it from using subsidies to underbid Boeing for a $35 billion contract for aerial refueling tankers. The W.T.O has no enforcement mechanism, and its findings will have to be settled through talks between United States and European officials. But in the meantime, Airbus has been moving forward with plans to raise several billion dollars in loans from European countries to develop its own plane with fuel-efficient composites, the A350 XWB. “I think there’s a belief by some in the U.S. that there’s the slightest hope in disrupting funding for the A350 XWB,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “And that’s just very unlikely.” The W.T.O. has ruled that the European aid loans would be legal if they were made on commercial terms, and it is not yet clear how the European countries would set the interest rates. But Mr. Hamilton said that with private capital markets constrained by the worldwide economic pressures, “their governments would still be a source of funding that they might not have in the capital markets,” even if the Europeans tied the loans to market rates. European trade officials contend that military research contracts helped Boeing get a head start on the composites. They say that it would be hypocritical to penalize Airbus in the tanker bidding since Boeing also had subsidies. If anything, the stakes seem higher now than in 2005. Problems with suppliers have delayed Boeing’s first Dreamliner by nearly three years, reducing its sales advantage over the A350 XWB. Efforts to resolve the trade dispute could also be complicated by other subsidized competitors. Dreamliner deliveries should start in 2011. Airbus hopes to introduce its plane in 2013. It has also been slowed by cost overruns on new, larger passenger and military models. As Brazil and Canada took over the regional jet markets roughly a decade ago, the W.T.O. ruled that each had improperly subsidized their exports. Now, Bombardier of Canada is building a midsize jetliner. Longer-term threats to Airbus and Boeing are also coming from China and Russia. “If you think this trade dispute is tough, what do you do with an emerging aerospace power that gets all its working capital from the government?” Mr. Aboulafia asked.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/16boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">W.T.O. Said to Find Improper Subsidies for Boeing<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>The long-running trans-Atlantic spat over government support of the world’s two biggest aircraft makers gained fresh momentum on Wednesday as a trade panel found that Boeing had received subsidies that violated global trade rules, people briefed on the decision said.American lawmakers said on Wednesday that the subsidies, $5 billion from federal and state agencies, were just a fraction of the $24 billion that Europe had alleged and were far less sweeping than the benefits its rival, Airbus, had received. But European leaders said that the finding, by a panel of the World Trade Organization, showed that the United States had also relied on subsidies in the fight for plane sales, and that the ruling would help prompt negotiations to resolve the problems. The decision is an interim finding and subject to appeal. But it could bring an epic battle over subsidies in the aircraft industry to a climax and redefine the competitive landscape not only for Boeing and Airbus, but also for new competitors in other regions. In a case decided in June, the W.T.O. found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies to vault past Boeing to become the world’s top jet builder. That ruling concluded that Airbus received the subsidies, including $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants, to produce its six best-selling models. It also concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,” without the subsidies. Wednesday’s ruling came in a countersuit by the European Union, which contended that Boeing had received nearly $24 billion in subsidies since the 1980s from research and development contracts for space and military agencies and in tax breaks from three states. That assistance, the Europeans argued, had placed Airbus at a competitive disadvantage in the North American market, the world’s second-largest in terms of passenger traffic after the Asia-Pacific region. American and European officials, who spoke anonymously because the ruling was not released publicly, said the W.T.O. panel found that Boeing had received subsidies through some of the research contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon, as well as through tax incentives linked to its facilities in Washington State, Kansas and Illinois. Still, the Americans said that only $2.6 billion of the research money was found to involve subsidies, compared with the more than $10 billion claimed by the European Union. And the trade panel pegged the value of the subsidies provided by the three states at about $400 million, a far lower total than the Europeans had claimed. European officials said the report did not estimate the value of the subsidies that Boeing gained from its military work. Both sides said the panel reiterated an earlier finding that Boeing had received $2.2 billion in export-related aid under a program that was phased out in 2006. Trade officials said the report was more than 1,000 pages, and it was not immediately clear how the panel had decided which research contracts constituted subsidies. European officials had contended in their suit that Boeing was able to take advantage of its research for NASA and the Pentagon to make technological advances in its commercial jets. As a result, France’s transport minister, Dominique Bussereau, and the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said in a statement that they were “extremely satisfied” by the interim findings. But Boeing released a statement Wednesday night saying that the ruling “amounts to a massive rejection” of the European case and maintained that Europe’s low-interest loans to Airbus, known as launch aid, stand “as the single largest and most flagrant illegal subsidy in the aerospace industry.” Some Congressional aides, however, said the panel found that the federal research subsidies gave Boeing an advantage in its early efforts to develop the first commercial jetliner to be made substantially with lightweight carbon composites. Boeing hopes to ride a wave of orders for the plane it developed, the 787 Dreamliner, to retake the lead from Airbus in overall sales. Airbus scrapped its first design for a rival plane, the A350, and is working on a new version that could hit the market in 2013. The trade dispute is also playing out while Boeing and Airbus compete for a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with new aerial refueling tankers. European officials said they hoped the new ruling would undercut Boeing’s complaints that it was facing a subsidized competitor.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/science/space/16nasa.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Plans to Fly Tourists to Space<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>Boeing said Wednesday that it was entering the space tourism business, an announcement that could bolster the Obama administration’s efforts to transform the National Aeronautics and Space Administration into an agency that focuses less on building rockets and more on nurturing a commercial space industry. The flights, which could begin as early as 2015, would most likely launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida to the International Space Station. The Obama administration has proposed turning over to private companies the business of taking NASA astronauts to orbit, and Boeing and Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas won an $18 million contract this year for preliminary development and testing of a capsule that could carry seven passengers. Current NASA plans call for four space station crew members to go up at a time, which would leave up to three seats available for space tourists. The flights would be the first to give nonprofessional astronauts the chance to go into orbit aboard a spacecraft launched from the United States. Seven earlier space tourists have made visits to the space station, riding in Russian Soyuz capsules. “We’re ready now to start talking to prospective customers,” said Eric C. Anderson, co-founder and chairman of Space Adventures, the space tourism company based in Virginia that would market the seats for Boeing. Boeing and Space Adventures have not set a price, although Mr. Anderson said it would be competitive with the Soyuz flights, which Space Adventures arranged with the Russian Space Agency. Guy Laliberté, founder of Cirque du Soleil, paid about $40 million for a Soyuz ride and an eight-day stay at the space station last year. But the prospects that anyone buying a ticket will get to space on an American vehicle hinge on discussions in Congress about the future of NASA. As the era of the space shuttle winds down — two, perhaps three shuttle flights remain — a clash of visions over what should come next has kept the space agency adrift for much of the past year. An authorization bill written by the House Science and Technology Committee to lay out the direction of NASA for the next three years would largely follow the traditional trajectory for human spaceflight. It calls on NASA to build a government-owned rocket — likely the Ares I, which NASA has been working on for five years — for taking astronauts to the space station and then a larger one for missions to the Moon, asteroids and eventually Mars. The competing vision, embodied in President Obama’s 2011 budget proposal for NASA, focuses instead on investing in companies like Boeing that want to develop the space equivalent of airlines. NASA would then just buy seats on those rockets to send its astronauts to the International Space Station. Competition, the thinking goes, would drive down the costs of getting to space, leading to a profitable new American industry and freeing more of NASA’s budget for deep-space missions. Advocates of the free enterprise approach are rallying to block the House version of the NASA authorization bill, which provides only $150 million a year over the next three years for the private-sector space travel initiative, which is known as commercial crew. Bob Werb, chairman of the Space Frontier Foundation, was blunt in his assessment of the House bill. “I think it’s awful,” he said. “It’s leaving NASA with way more pork than program. I see that as a disaster for the agency.” Mr. Werb’s group is urging its supporters to register disapproval with their Congressional representatives. By contrast, the president’s budget proposed $6 billion over five years for the commercial crew program. At Wednesday’s news conference, Boeing officials said that the federal government would have to pay much of the development costs in order for the effort to succeed. “This is an uncertain market,” said John Elbon, program manager for Boeing’s commercial crew effort. “If we had to do this with Boeing investment only and the risk factors were in there, we wouldn’t be able to close the business case.” The tight constraint, of course, is money. Last year, a panel led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin, concluded that the ambitious program started under President George W. Bush to establish a permanent moon base was “not executable” because of inadequate financing. In fact, the panel could not devise any program that could send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit and still fit within the $100 billion allocated to the human spaceflight program in the fiscal years of 2010 through 2020. It offered several alternatives that would require an extra $30 billion over the next decade. Mr. Obama’s budget request for 2011 sought a modest increase in NASA over all, to $19 billion, but kept the budget projections for the human spaceflight program almost unchanged from the levels that the Augustine panel found inadequate. The panel said that without an increase, the United States should scale back its space ambitions. “With that budget,” Mr. Augustine said in an interview this summer, “I still think there is no really meaningful space exploration program that involves humans.” The administration worked around the budget shortfall by proposing the cancellation of the entire moon program, known as Constellation, including the Ares I rocket and the Orion crew capsule. Instead, NASA would essentially take a five-year hiatus from large-scale development initiatives and instead work on new technologies that could make the task of space exploration easier and cheaper. The House Science and Technology Committee, in its effort to squeeze NASA’s human spaceflight program into the budget box, deleted almost all the money from commercial crew and large-scale technology demonstration projects and applied it to slimmed-down Constellation rockets. Last month, the Senate passed its version of the NASA authorization bill, which is more of a compromise. It provides less for commercial crew in the first three years than the president’s request, but the longer-term plan is to provide the same $6 billion, spread over six years instead of five. It cancels the Ares I rocket and instead directs NASA to begin development of a heavy-lift rocket and indicates that the design should be based on space shuttle technologies, a boon for those contractors. However, some experts like Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now heads the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the Senate bill might be repeating the mistake of asking NASA to do too much with too little money. The Senate bill provides less money for development of a larger heavy-lift rocket than the House does for completing the Ares I, already well under development. “I respect the need for political compromise,” Dr. Pace said of the Senate bill, but added, “It takes some programmatic risk. It spreads itself out too much.” Staff members of the House science committee have been meeting with their counterparts on the Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation seeking a middle ground. House leaders could move forward with the science committee’s bill or substitute the Senate bill or a compromise. If no final NASA authorization emerges, the Senate and House appropriation committees would decide what to include in NASA’s 2011 budget and could end up with something closer to the original Obama proposal.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/opinion/09thurs2.html?ref=boeingcompany">Torture Is a Crime, Not a Secret<date>Published: September 8, 2010</date><text>Five men who say the Bush administration sent them to other countries to be tortured had a chance to be the first ones to have torture claims heard in court. But because the Obama administration decided to adopt the Bush administration’s claim that hearing the case would divulge state secrets, the men’s lawsuit was tossed out on Wednesday by the full United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The decision diminishes any hope that this odious practice will finally receive the legal label it deserves: a violation of international law.The lawsuit was brought in 2007 against a Boeing subsidiary, Jeppesen Dataplan, that the plaintiffs said had arranged the rendition flights that took them to Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistan to be tortured. One of the men, Binyam Mohamed, had his bones broken in Morocco, where security agents also cut his skin with a scalpel and poured a stinging liquid into his wounds. But the merits of the case were never considered because the Bush administration argued that even discussing the matter in court would violate the state secrets privilege. Barack Obama told voters in 2008 that he opposed the government cult of secrecy, but once he became president, his Justice Department also argued that the case should be dismissed on secrecy grounds. The Ninth Circuit was sharply divided, voting 6 to 5 to dismiss the case and overturn a decision to let it proceed that was made by a panel of three circuit judges last year. The majority said it reached its decision reluctantly and was not trying to send a signal that secrecy could be used regularly to dismiss lawsuits. But even though it is public knowledge that Jeppesen arranged the torture flights, the majority said any effort by the company to defend itself would pose “an unacceptable risk of disclosure of state secrets.” That notion was demolished by the five-judge minority that dissented from the ruling, pointing out that the plaintiffs were never even given a chance to make their case in court using nonsecret evidence, including a sworn statement by a former Jeppesen employee about the company’s role in what he called “the torture flights.” The case should have been sent back to the district court to examine which evidence was truly secret; now it will have to be appealed to a Supreme Court that is unlikely to be sympathetic to the plaintiffs. The state secrets doctrine is so blinding and powerful that it should be invoked only when the most grave national security matters are at stake — nuclear weapons details, for example, or the identity of covert agents. It should not be used to defend against allegations that if true, as the dissenting judges wrote, would be “gross violations of the norms of international law.” All too often in the past, the judges pointed out, secrecy privileges have been used to avoid embarrassing the government, not to protect real secrets. In this case, the embarrassment and the shame to America’s reputation are already too well known.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/us/09secrets.html?ref=boeingcompany">Court Sides With C.I.A. on 'Extraordinary Rendition'<date>Published: September 8, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that former prisoners of the C.I.A. could not sue over their alleged torture in overseas prisons because such a lawsuit might expose secret government information.The sharply divided ruling was a major victory for the Obama administration’s efforts to advance a sweeping view of executive secrecy powers. It strengthens the White House’s hand as it has pushed an array of assertive counterterrorism policies, while raising an opportunity for the Supreme Court to rule for the first time in decades on the scope of the president’s power to restrict litigation that could reveal state secrets. By a 6-to-5 vote, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed a lawsuit against Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., a Boeing subsidiary accused of arranging flights for the Central Intelligence Agency to transfer prisoners to other countries for imprisonment and interrogation. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the case on behalf of five former prisoners who say they were tortured in captivity — and that Jeppesen was complicit in that alleged abuse. Judge Raymond C. Fisher described the case, which reversed an earlier decision, as presenting “a painful conflict between human rights and national security.” But, he said, the majority had “reluctantly” concluded that the lawsuit represented “a rare case” in which the government’s need to protect state secrets trumped the plaintiffs’ need to have a day in court. While the alleged abuses occurred during the Bush administration, the ruling added a chapter to the Obama administration’s aggressive national security policies. Its counterterrorism programs have in some ways departed from the expectations of change fostered by President Obama’s campaign rhetoric, which was often sharply critical of former President George W. Bush’s approach. Among other policies, the Obama national security team has also authorized the C.I.A. to try to kill a United States citizen suspected of terrorism ties, blocked efforts by detainees in Afghanistan to bring habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the basis for their imprisonment without trial, and continued the C.I.A.’s so-called extraordinary rendition program of prisoner transfers — though the administration has forbidden torture and says it seeks assurances from other countries that detainees will not be mistreated. The A.C.L.U. vowed to appeal the Jeppesen Dataplan case to the Supreme Court, which would present the Roberts court with a fresh opportunity to weigh in on a high-profile test of the scope and limits of presidential power in counterterrorism matters. It has been more than 50 years since the Supreme Court issued a major ruling on the state-secrets privilege, a judicially created doctrine that the government has increasingly used to win dismissals of lawsuits related to national security, shielding its actions from judicial review. In 2007, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of a similar rendition and torture ruling by the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. The current case turns on whether the executive can invoke the state-secrets privilege to shut down entire lawsuits, or whether that power should be limited to withholding particular pieces of secret information. In April 2009, a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit adopted the narrower view, ruling that the lawsuit as a whole should proceed. But the Obama administration appealed to the full San Francisco-based appeals court. A group of 11 of its judges reheard the case, and a narrow majority endorsed the broader view of executive secrecy powers. They concluded that the lawsuit must be dismissed without a trial — even one that would seek to rely only on public information. “This case requires us to address the difficult balance the state secrets doctrine strikes between fundamental principles of our liberty, including justice, transparency, accountability and national security,” Judge Fisher wrote. “Although as judges we strive to honor all of these principles, there are times when exceptional circumstances create an irreconcilable conflict between them.” Ben Wizner, a senior A.C.L.U. lawyer who argued the case before the appeals court, said the group was disappointed in the ruling. “To this date, not a single victim of the Bush administration’s torture program has had his day in court,” Mr. Wizner said. “That makes this a sad day not only for the torture survivors who are seeking justice in this case, but for all Americans who care about the rule of law and our nation’s reputation in the world. If this decision stands, the United States will have closed its courts to torture victims while providing complete immunity to their torturers.” Some plaintiffs in the case said they were tortured by C.I.A. interrogators at an agency “black site” prison in Afghanistan, while others said they were tortured by Egypt and Morocco after the C.I.A. handed them off to foreign security services.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/business/09arms.html?ref=boeingcompany">Military Contractors Shed Workers as Pentagon Cuts Budget<date>Published: September 8, 2010</date><text>Tightened spending at the Pentagon is unsettling the defense industry, with Lockheed Martin announcing Wednesday that one-quarter of its executives had applied for buyouts as the company cut costs.Officials said most of the 600 executives requesting the buyout were at or near retirement age. But the response shows how significantly the industry has begun to contract as a long surge in military spending comes to an end. Lockheed had expected only 200 or so executives to apply, the company said. Nonetheless all 600 requests are expected to be honored. The retrenchment at Lockheed, the world’s largest military company, seems likely to heighten concerns about further job cuts in the high-paying aerospace and defense industries at a time when the nation’s unemployment rate remains high. Lockheed has reduced its work force by 10,000, to a total of 136,000, since the beginning of last year. Boeing, another big Pentagon contractor, said Tuesday that it would cut the number of executives in its military aircraft business by 10 percent as part of broader consolidation that will eliminate more than 400 jobs. The company, which also makes commercial jetliners, has already trimmed 1,700 jobs in its military business as part of a reduction of 10,000 jobs across the company. And Northrop Grumman recently announced plans to close troubled shipyards as it considers spinning off its $6 billion shipbuilding business. Northrop announced in late August that it would lay off 642 workers at its shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., by the end of the year. By 2013, it plans to close a shipyard near New Orleans that employs 4,700 people and shift the work to Pascagoula. The loss of jobs comes as the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, has canceled or restructured nearly three dozen weapons programs since last year. And as the growth in military spending slows, Mr. Gates is pushing for more overhead cuts and greater efficiency to free money for the most crucial programs. Pentagon officials have said they are singling out wasteful spending and that the belt-tightening would not necessarily lead to job losses. But top industry executives say that it would be hard to meet Mr. Gates’s goal of saving $100 billion over the next few years without cutting jobs and closing plants, and that could stir Congressional opposition to some of the proposals. “It seems that many senior executives expect the future to be less bright, and some of them may be pretty smart to take the buyout since their next chance to get out could be on far less attractive terms,” said Loren B. Thompson, a Lockheed consultant. He said the buyouts and recent layoffs “are a sure sign that things are deteriorating for the industry.” Lockheed’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in a statement on Wednesday that the 600 buyouts would “enable us to achieve significant cost savings and a leaner management structure at a time when our customers have an urgent need for more affordable solutions to the global security challenges they face.” Lockheed officials said the buyout offer had been extended to vice presidents as well as directors, a title accorded to many program managers and department heads. The terms were fairly generous. Executives with 20 years at the company could receive a lump sum equal to 1.25 times their annual base pay, as well as $2,000 for each year they had been at the company to help pay for their own health insurance. The company said so many people took the offer that it would have to hire some replacements. It could not immediately say how much the buyouts would save. As part of the Pentagon’s cost-saving plan, Mr. Gates has also proposed closing a major military command and reducing the number of generals and admirals. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, Ashton B. Carter, has been talking to industry executives about how to reduce cost overruns and make weapons more affordable. Like other big contractors, Lockheed has reorganized some of its operations, and it is planning to divest itself of two units. Most of the companies have also been expanding their international sales and adding jobs in hot new areas, like computer security, to try to maintain their profit margins even if Pentagon sales flatten out or decline.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/business/31road.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Crews Train for the 787. Where’s the Plane?<date>Published: August 30, 2010</date><text>RENTON, Wash.STATIONED at the front of a mockup of a new 787 airplane cabin, Megan Smith, a Boeing safety instructor, was demonstrating how to open the exit door, activate the emergency slide and get passengers out of the plane in a hurry. Simulated flames flickered outside the cabin windows. Ms. Smith, a former flight attendant for Alaska Airlines, heaved open the door and shouted evacuation orders to imaginary passengers, her arms directing the way as assertively as a New York traffic officer’s. “Leave everything! Come this way! Exit here! You, stay at the bottom, help the people! Exit here! Jump! Jump!” she yelled. I could imagine a cabin of anxious passengers complying exactly as ordered. She was asked to repeat this exercise several times so a television reporter could get himself reacting on video. Because I found this amusing, I was then asked if I would like to try to run the drill myself. Sure. Taking my place by the exit door, which I struggled to get open, I hollered: “Yo, people! Get out now! This way out! Jump! You, pal, get a move on! Leave everything behind! Anybody I see bringing a carry-on with them goes down this slide head-first! Move it, people!” O.K., so I don’t have a future in the exciting fields of cabin safety or in-flight service. Still, it was edifying to experience firsthand some of the training procedures that Boeing is conducting at its sprawling Customer Experience Center here to show how it is preparing to put its much-delayed 787 Dreamliner airplane into service. The 787, like the double-deck A380 that Boeing’s rival, Airbus, brought to the market three years ago, is a plane aimed at the future of air travel, where international flights and expanding global airline alliances are expected to drive industry growth for years. Both planes are remarkable flying machines. The superjumbo A380s now flying are mostly configured comfortably, with 500 to 550 seats in a three-class cabin arrangement, but an A380 can actually carry about 900 passengers in a single-class cabin. The 787s, on the other hand, will carry 210 to 290 passengers. Both planes are aimed at the nonstop long-haul market. Boeing promotes the 787’s agility (it can serve airports not big enough for the A380), and the extra fuel efficiency and passenger comfort it offers, compared with older commercial airplanes, because of its light carbon-fiber composite construction. But while about 30 of the 234 Airbus A380s that have been ordered are already plying the skies with various international airlines, the Boeing 787 is still more than two years behind schedule. Last Friday, a day after I visited the Boeing complex here, Boeing said that because of some problems with the Rolls-Royce engines, the first delivery of a 787 (for which the company has almost 850 orders) would be delayed again — from this December to the middle of the first quarter of 2011. Boeing has set up a worldwide network of centers to train the 787’s pilots, flight crews and mechanics, including one in Renton. Pilots, including some who will switch from, say, a long-haul Boeing 777 to the new 787, train first in a mock cockpit built around a flat-panel display system that simulates flying. That system also reduces the amount of time a pilot needs to spend in a so-called full-flight simulator. The real fun, though, comes in the full-flight simulator — an amazing contraption that costs many millions of dollars and resembles giant lunar-landing vehicles. Inside, pilots train in a cockpit replica, while elaborate technological and hydraulic systems reproduce the reality of flight. Lifelike visual displays mimic certain airports, skies and locales, and the actual motion and feel of an airplane in all aspects of flight. Boeing has a building full of full-flight simulators, including the new one for the 787. A gaggle of reporters crowded inside the 787 simulator last Thursday as a Boeing pilot, Gregg Pointon, prepared the mock cockpit for flight. The simulated Seattle airport through the window looked exactly like the real thing, and even the simulated taxiing felt real, though the actual motion simulation was kept turned off, for safety reasons. Captain Pointon snapped shut his seat belt and said, “We are now ready for takeoff.” Well, the 787 isn’t quite ready for takeoff. But soon, Boeing insists, soon.</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/business/global/28boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Delays Delivery of the 787 Dreamliner<date>Published: August 27, 2010</date><text>The first of Boeing’s long-awaited 787 Dreamliner aircraft will not be delivered until next year, the company said Friday, adding to a string of problems that has delayed the project by more than two years.Boeing cited the availability of a Rolls-Royce engine — needed for test flights this fall — as a reason for the delay. The plane maker said the first Dreamliner would not be delivered until the middle of the first quarter of 2011. But several analysts said difficulties with other suppliers had already slowed the flight tests. They doubted that the first delivery, which had been scheduled for December, would occur before the second quarter. More delays could add to the costs for Boeing, which is counting on the fuel-efficient jetliner, made largely with lightweight composite materials, to retake the lead in worldwide plane production from its European rival Airbus. The latest setback came after a Rolls-Royce engine failed during a test earlier this month. Boeing and Rolls-Royce issued somewhat conflicting statements about the problem, and analysts said the companies seemed to be focused more on finger-pointing than in explaining what happened. Rolls-Royce, based in Britain, acknowledged that the engine had suffered an “uncontained failure,” in which a limited amount of debris spewed into the test facility. But Rolls-Royce said it could fix the problems, and it maintained that the failure was “unrelated” to its ability to make engines available for Boeing’s flight tests. But a Boeing spokesman, Jim Proulx, said that the plane maker had been counting on using that engine in a Dreamliner making test flights this fall. Boeing executives said the need for changes to the engine, which must eventually be certified by federal regulators, added to the concerns about the testing delays. “We would not have issued our statement about the delay if there had not been the engine issue,” Mr. Proulx said. Boeing, which will continue with other test flights, will push back delivery of the first aircraft to its maiden customer, All Nippon Airways of Japan. Boeing said this month that workmanship problems with other suppliers might push delivery of the plane a few weeks into 2011. Its statement on Friday said that the engine issue had prompted it to extend the delivery time. Several analysts said they were puzzled by how little the companies revealed about the problem. Rolls-Royce and General Electric are both building engines for the Dreamliner. Scott Hamilton, the president of the Leeham Company in Issaquah, Wash., said: “You would think there would be another Rolls-Royce engine or two or three they could use. Why is this one so critical?” Rolls-Royce said it was working closely with Boeing to expedite its engine deliveries. And on the FlightGlobal Web site, Jon Ostrower suggested that Boeing might be planning to substitute an enhanced version of the Rolls-Royce engine for its basic model in the planes built for All Nippon Airways. Both Heidi Wood, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, and Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said they doubted the first planes would be delivered before next spring. “Experience shows that programs that ‘swim funny’ do so for much longer than most, especially the bulls, ever expect and can be a grind all the way to the finish,” Ms. Wood wrote in a research note. Of the nearly 850 Dreamliners on order, more than 200 are scheduled to be equipped with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine, Boeing said. (Rolls-Royce is a separate company from the carmaker of the same name.) Most airlines have waited patiently for the plane, which is seen as crucial to Boeing’s future. But Boeing could lose some sales and pay additional penalties for further delays. The latest 787 delay comes just as the airline industry is recovering from the downturn and airlines, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, have begun to place orders for new aircraft. But Boeing still has a substantial lead over Airbus in shifting to the lightweight carbon-composite fuselage. Airbus’s first similar plane, the A350, is not expected to be ready before 2013. All Nippon Airways said Friday that the delay, the sixth since it ordered 50 of the planes in 2004, was “regrettable.” A spokeswoman for the airline, Megumi Tezuka, said it was trying to find out whether the delay on the initial plane would push back its other Dreamliner deliveries.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/business/10flier.html?ref=boeingcompany">Inspired by Flying, and Inspiring Others<date>Published: August 9, 2010</date><text>I’VE loved airplanes ever since I was a child. In fact, my mom took me to my first air show when I was just a baby. She said I loved it.I built all kinds of models growing up, and I took my first airline flight from Fairbanks, Alaska, to Detroit when I was just 9 years old. My first flight in a small general aviation plane was when I was 16. I got to fly it a little and I was hooked. I wanted to design and fly aircraft. But at age 27, I was told I had multiple sclerosis. I was devastated. I had just earned my private pilot’s license and I thought my twin passions of flying and designing were doomed. I thought I was going to wind up in a wheelchair, helpless. At that time, no one gave me much reason to think otherwise. But within a few years of my diagnosis, great strides were made in treating multiple sclerosis with F.D.A.-approved disease-modifying regimens. These new approaches helped so many of us so much. I even got my pilot’s license again. I have what’s called a “special issuance” third-class Federal Aviation Administration medical certificate that allows me to fly as long as I get a medical O.K. once a year. The disease doesn’t hold me back in my career or in my personal life. When I’m not working designing cool things for planes, I travel and meet with multiple sclerosis patients with Team Copaxone, a group of multiple sclerosis patients, like me, who lead really active lives. When I go to these events, I fly my own plane, which I built in four years from a kit. I love flying my own plane. But for business trips, I fly commercial. I’ve even been to London seven times and got very comfortable doing the trip. I tell patients not to let the disease hold them back from traveling, even though commercial air travel isn’t as much fun as it used to be. I think I’m lucky because most of my business flights are completely uneventful. But anyone who flies, whether as a pilot or passenger, knows that even the most uneventful flights can be inspiring. I was headed out of Phoenix up to Portland, sitting in a window seat. I’m a “window seat guy” because I like to bring my camera with me to take pictures of the skies, sunsets and scenery. Sometimes I use these photos as background for my illustrations. The light over the desert and the way it was reflecting off the clouds was really interesting. All of a sudden, I got this idea. I started taking pictures like mad. I even took some video. When I got to my hotel I put together some thoughts, and when I returned to my office I presented it. I can’t tell you too much because it’s patent-pending, proprietary and I’d get in trouble. But it has something to do with light, shadow and flight. I’m pretty excited. Actually, everything about flight excites me. My plane has this huge canopy, and I can see all around. There’s nothing more wonderful than flying, buzzing the clouds. It’s like the clouds and I are playing. Just recently, I was listening to my iPod while flying, and Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” came on. I broke into this huge smile. I don’t think I’ve stopped smiling since. I know I have a lot to be happy about. Maybe when other patients see me and my plane they smile, too. But more important, I hope they know that their dreams still can come true. I know mine did.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/business/global/05air.html?ref=boeingcompany">Cathay Pacific Sees Its Profit Rebound in First Half of 2010<date>Published: August 4, 2010</date><text>HONG KONG — Cathay Pacific reported a sharp rebound in earnings Wednesday and said it planned to invest heavily in 36 new aircraft, underscoring the rapid recovery in air travel, particularly in Asia, as the global economy picked up steam this year. Cathay, which is based in Hong Kong and is seen as a bellwether for the airline sector in Asia, said net income for the first half of 2010 totaled 6.84 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $881 million, up from 812 million dollars during the same period last year and well above what analysts had expected. The robust earnings came despite the massive disruption caused by a volcanic ash cloud over Europe in April. Revenues surged 34 percent as passengers returned to the air and cargo volumes recovered from the collapse in international trade last year. Cathay carried nearly 13 million passengers in the January-to-June period, 8.5 percent more than the same period a year earlier. Cargo volumes were up nearly a quarter from the first half of 2009. The results mirror the improved performance of other carriers as the economic recovery continues around the globe. In Europe, British Airways, which was especially badly hit by the volcanic eruption, reported a loss for the quarter that ended June 30, but it was not as bad as analysts had expected. The sector’s recovery has been particularly marked in the Asia-Pacific region, thanks to the area’s economic resilience. The latest passenger numbers released by the International Air Transport Association last week showed growth of 15.5 percent in June, twice the rate seen in Europe. Singapore Airlines, which like Cathay is heavily dependent on business travelers, also topped analysts’ expectations last week with its earnings for the April-to-June quarter. The carrier posted a net profit of 253 million Singapore dollars, or $187 million, for the quarter, and said that advance bookings and sentiment among shippers indicated that the recent rebound could hold up for the rest of the year. Cathay Pacific, likewise, said in a statement accompanying its half-year earnings that “if present trends continue, we expect our financial results to continue to be strong in the second half of 2010.” Although it cautioned that rising fuel prices or any economic slowdown could quickly dent earnings, Cathay’s renewed confidence has prompted it to loosen its purse strings again. On Wednesday, Cathay announced that it had signed a letter of intent to buy 30 Airbus aircraft and that it planned to exercise existing purchasing rights for 6 Boeing aircraft. The value of the intended purchases, at list prices, is about 75 billion Hong Kong dollars, Cathay said. Like its peers, Cathay had scrapped routes and spending projects as the economic crisis took hold and put staff on unpaid leave last year. Cathay shares closed 3.9 percent higher after the airline released its earnings report.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/business/29boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Military Cutbacks Redirect Boeing to Commercial Side<date>Published: July 28, 2010</date><text>After a surge in military spending sustained Boeing through a downturn in civilian orders and manufacturing problems with a new jetliner over the last decade, the pendulum is swinging the other way.Just as the Pentagon is slowing its spending, orders for commercial aircraft are showing a surprising recovery. Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr. described the shift for analysts on Wednesday as he discussed the company’s second-quarter results. He said the company might increase production of its best-selling 737 passenger jets more than planned if its suppliers could keep up. But the belt-tightening at the Pentagon is creating so much pressure that Boeing’s military business is likely to cut jobs through layoffs and attrition. Boeing, based in Chicago, has raised its forecasts for a rebound in commercial air traffic. Boeing and its main rival, Airbus, both booked more plane orders than expected last week at the Farnborough International Air Show in Britain. As a result, Mr. McNerney said, Boeing will review whether there is an “opportunity beyond” plans to increase its monthly production of the single-aisle 737 to 35 planes in 2012 from 31.5 now. “I’d say there’s some upside just based on a market view,” he said. But before Boeing could raise that rate further, it needs to decide, probably by this fall, whether its suppliers could handle additional investments and training to pick up the pace, he added. Mr. McNerney also said for the first time that “on balance” Boeing’s customers were “sort of pushing us” toward building a new plane to replace the 737 rather than just buying more fuel-efficient engines to battle foreign competitors. He said the crucial question, which Boeing hopes to decide by year-end, was when the technology for a new plane, and the airlines’ willingness to pay for it, would come together. He said it “makes no sense” to replace the engines on the current 737s if Boeing was going to build a new plane before 2020. But if the replacement would not arrive until well after that, he said, “then the case for the new engine strengthens.” Mr. McNerney made the comments in a conference call on Boeing’s second-quarter results, which reflected a sharp drop in plane sales caused by the recent recession. Boeing said its profit fell 21 percent to $787 million, or $1.06 a share, from $998 million, or $1.41 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue declined 9 percent to $15.57 billion from $17.15 billion. The company’s shares fell $1.30, to $67.32 on Wednesday. Still, the share price has more than doubled from its low in March 2009, partly on optimism that carriers in Asia and the Middle East would lead a revival in orders, as they are doing now. The shares also rose as Boeing cleared manufacturing problems with its 787 Dreamliner, a midsize plane made largely of lightweight composites that has attracted record advance orders. Mr. McNerney said Wednesday that the 787 had completed more than half of its flight tests without any major problems. He said Boeing hoped to deliver the first one by year-end, though that could slip into early 2011. But as the growth in the Pentagon’s budget slows, Boeing’s military business, which accounts for half its revenues, is slipping. “There is no question that the overall cost structure of that business has to come down,” Mr. McNerney said. And its best hope for Congress to buy $1.2 billion more of its C-17 cargo planes dissolved Tuesday when a House panel rejected the idea. Mr. McNerney said Boeing was looking overseas for more military sales.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/business/global/20iht-ravgulf.html?ref=boeingcompany">From Nothing to a Global Hub for Aviation<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>NEW YORK — Attention airline passengers: While some of you were fuming right along with the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland this past spring, others were finding a new route to international destinations that avoided the ashy Atlantic skies entirely. So, while many regions of the world took a hit in April and May, Middle Eastern carriers carried on, showing a 19 percent increase in passenger volume over last year.On top of that, the number of their passengers choosing to fly premium class went up 25 percent — “a race to the top,” according to the International Air Transport Association, the lobbying organization and trade group based in Montreal and Geneva. Global shifts in economic circumstances have created new opportunities, and aviation industry insiders say many of these, both short- and long-term, promise to be in the Middle East. “The Middle East had the luxury of starting from a blank piece of paper,” said Steven Lott, communications director for IATA in North America. “They were able to design the airline model and the infrastructure models. They opened the biggest airport in the world,” he said, referring to the newly opened Al Maktoum International Airport in Dubai, designed to handle 120 million passengers a year. “Less than 30 years ago they were able to start with a blank piece of paper and move ahead.” Since the days of pearl diving in the Gulf, the United Arab Emirates have been a crossroads for trade. The airlines, however, Emirates of Dubai, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and the discount airline Air Arabia of Sharjah, are relatively new arrivals on the scene. As economic growth makes air travel more accessible in India, China and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the emirates have become a tourist and business center as well as a transit hub. “The potential is unbelievable,” said Nawal Taneja, the chairman of the aviation department at Ohio State University. “India, has 1.2 billion people,” Professor Taneja said. “Say that on average only 20 percent have the ability to buy a cheap ticket, that’s 240 million people.” “Where is the market potential 10 years from now? It is in China. It is in India. The U.A.E. airlines are setting up their expansion growth there.” The birth of new airlines, like Bahrain Air and Jazeera Airways of Kuwait, bears witness to that policy, as does the building of new airports in Dubai and Doha, Qatar, and an enormous expansion of Abu Dhabi International. Abu Dhabi’s leaders have decided to update their oil-fueled economy by turning their emirate, with its population of 1.5 million, into a global center for aviation by 2030. Mubadala Development, created by the government, has been buying into or connecting with aerospace companies like Rolls Royce, Sikorsky and Finmeccanica, to start local manufacturing and repair facilities. “Our growth projections tell us that there is an enormous market potential” Homaid Al Shemmari, the executive director of Mubadala Aerospace, wrote in an e-mail message. Emerging markets like the Middle East are changing the aviation market, said Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s vice president of marketing. “We’ve seen very dramatic growth in the last decade,” he sad. “They are leveraging their geographic position in the world. They’re leveraging the newest technologies.” They are also leveraging their clout. With airlines in the United Arab Emirates spending billions on planes, Airbus and Boeing have agreed to assist with Mubadala’s maintenance and repair stations and to help develop Strata, a manufacturing plant in Al Ain, 145 kilometers, or about 90 miles, from Abu Dhabi. “The Middle East already has the world’s largest fleet of wide-body aircraft, with many more orders in place for newer platforms such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350,” Mr. Shemmari said. “This investment was made in anticipation that Strata will be used to produce sections of aircraft for the A330, 340 and 380.” The recently opened Strata factory is expected to employ 500 people and build products for Airbus by 2014, according to a company brochure. Mubadala said 10,000 people would be needed to work in Abu Dhabi’s new aviation and aerospace plants and the goal was to fill those jobs with local citizens. This may be challenging. The aim of progressing from a lucrative, low-employment oil economy into more labor-intensive activities is not just to make money but also to spread the social benefits, creating job opportunities that will enable people to participate in the economic growth of their country. “Although Abu Dhabi is fortunate to have both the capital and energy needed to sustain the requirements of the aerospace industry, there will be a heavy focus placed on developing the highly skilled workforce that is needed,” Mr. Shemmari said. The first test will come at the Strata plant. Airbus and Boeing are already on site, and aviation job boards are heavy with Middle Eastern help-wanted advertisements. “These people are swimming in wealth but they have to be willing to be taught how to repair an engine or repair an aircraft or even sit in an office for eight hours and diligently get paperwork done,” said a contractor who has worked in the region but did not want to be identified. “They do need education. They need people to get technical degrees. They need to have people actually willing to do the work.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/business/global/20plane.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Gets Order for Up to 30 Jets From Dubai<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>The aviation giant Boeing said Monday that it had obtained an order for 30 of its wide-body 777 jets from Emirates Airline of Dubai.The plane maker did not reveal the value of the deal in a statement, but the transaction would be worth nearly $7 billion at list prices. The deal, announced at the Farnborough Air Show in Britain, is a sign that commercial aviation, and Boeing’s fortunes, are starting to recover from the global recession. “Today’s order underscores the airline’s confidence in the airplane which forms the backbone of its fleet,“ Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the statement. “For that we are very grateful.” Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman and chief executive of Emirates, added: “Since we took delivery of our first 777 14 years ago, the airplane’s reliability, performance and operating economics have firmly established it as the backbone of our fleet.” Emirates took delivery of its first Boeing 777 — a 777-200 — in 1996, and since then the airline has deployed the 777 on short-, medium- and long-haul routes. The order could be one of the largest at the show. Farnborough, outside London, alternates with Paris each year as the site of the industry’s most prominent event, and executives are looking for further signs of an upswing there. Airbus, Boeing’s European rival, has sold 131 commercial planes this year. Its chief operating officer, John Leahy, told reporters on Saturday that Airbus could double that number through orders at the show. Before the announcement Monday, Boeing had said that it received orders for 177 planes this year. It also flew its new mid-size 787 Dreamliner jet, which is undergoing testing, to the show. Last month, Emirates, the largest Arab airline, ordered 32 Airbus A380 superjumbo jets, valued at about $11 billion. Both Boeing and Airbus are presumably providing discounts to Emirates on the latest orders, though the extent of the discounts could not be determined. The orders from Emirates, which carries passengers from all over the world through its Dubai base, illustrate how the recovery is being led by airlines in the Middle East. Boeing and Airbus both released forecasts recently suggesting that commercial air traffic, which dipped last year, would return over the next several years to its historic average growth rate of 5 percent each year. The sharpest growth and demand for new planes will occur in the Middle East and China. The United States and Europe are expected to rebound more slowly. Also on Monday, The Associated Press reported that GE Capital Aviation Services had ordered 40 Boeing 737-800 planes for $3 billion at list prices.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/business/global/20airshow.html?ref=boeingcompany">Orders at Air Show Bode Well for Recovery<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>FARNBOROUGH, England — In the best evidence yet of a strengthening recovery in the commercial aviation sector, the world’s two largest makers of aircraft on Monday announced more than $24 billion worth of orders. Much of that came from leasing companies eager to help airlines bolster capacity as global air traffic recovered.Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, reaped deals for more than 180 new planes on the opening day of the Farnborough International Airshow, one of the largest aviation bazaars. But while industry leaders spoke of the airplane market in more bullish terms than in the last two years, analysts cautioned that broader economic growth — a leading driver of passenger and cargo demand — remained weak in many important regions, particularly Western Europe. Jet makers, however, hope to tap into renewed optimism about air travel after two years of devastating losses for most airlines. “The market is coming back, and I feel very confident about how we are positioned,” said James F. Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial aircraft division. “Financing has stabilized, and we are seeing new leasing companies enter the marketplace,” he added. “There is a lot of pent-up demand.” Last month, the International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva, forecast that airlines would report a collective profit of $2.5 billion this year after recording a loss of $9.9 billion in 2009 and $16 billion in 2008. Global demand for air transportation exceeded prerecession levels in May, with a 12 percent increase in passenger traffic from a year earlier and a 34 percent gain in cargo traffic, the association said. “I would say that we are way beyond the leading edge of the recovery,” said Tim Mahoney, president and chief executive of Honeywell Aerospace, a major supplier of aircraft engines and cockpit electronics. “We are seeing evidence of that in several different segments, including flight hours, passenger numbers and freight traffic.” But while executives hailed the revival as a vote of confidence in a global rebound, some warned that recent shocks like the debt crisis in Greece showed that vulnerabilities remained. “In terms of trade demand, we’re seeing a very strong recovery,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. “But in terms of the broad economy, things are still very uncertain. There’s still a bit of a disconnect.” Air Lease Corporation, the jet financing and leasing company formed this year by Steven F. Udvar-Hazy and John Plueger, the former chiefs of A.I.G.’s aircraft International Lease Finance Corporation, placed its first order for new planes on Monday, signing for 51 short-range Airbus A320 and A321 jets valued at $4.4 billion at list prices. Mr. Udvar-Hazy said the first of those planes would be delivered in early 2011. Air Lease, which recently raised more than $3 billion in financing, was also expected to place a significant order from Boeing in the coming days, most likely for 737s, said industry executives who requested anonymity because the deal was not complete. Mr. Udvar-Hazy has said that Air Lease aims to have a fleet of more than 100 planes available for lease by early next year. GE Capital Aviation Services, a division of General Electric, announced orders for 100 single-aisle planes worth a total of nearly $8 billion. The leasing company, based in Ireland and the United States, ordered 60 Airbus A320s, valued at $4.9 billion, and an additional 40 new Boeing 737 planes worth roughly $3 billion. Boeing predicted last week that a vast majority, about 69 percent, of new jet sales in the next 20 years would be single-aisle aircraft like the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, which normally seat around 150 passengers. Demand from emerging markets in Asia and low-cost airlines in Europe and North America is expected to drive those sales. “The single-aisle market is the one that offers the most flexibility in terms of marketability” for leasing companies, said Mr. Aboulafia of the Teal Group. Airline customers placed several orders for long-range wide-body planes on Monday. Aeroflot, the Russian flag airline, said it would buy 11 of Airbus’s wide-body A330 planes valued at $1.7 billion. The deal follows a trip to Russia last week by the Airbus chief executive, Thomas O. Enders, and a delegation of German business leaders who accompanied the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, aimed at bolstering trade. Emirates Airline of Dubai confirmed an order for 30 of Boeing’s twin-aisle 777 jets. The airline has continued its rapid expansion throughout the industry’s recent downturn as it seeks to establish its Dubai hub as a central gateway to global air travel. The deal, valued at around $9 billion at list prices, includes 18 planes that Boeing attributed to an unidentified customer in April. The purchase followed an $11 billion Emirates order for 32 Airbus A380 superjumbo jets announced last month and which brings the airlines’ total commitment to the 525-seat, twin-deck plane to 90. Emirates has 10 of the planes in service. Analysts said Boeing and Airbus probably were giving Emirates significant discounts on the latest orders, though the manufacturers and the airline would not comment on the extent of any reductions. Norwegian Air Shuttle, a low-cost airline based in Oslo, said it would exercise options to buy 15 more Boeing 737 models, adding to a 2007 order for 42 of the planes. The deal is worth almost $1.2 billion at list prices. Analysts said that while the industry’s recovery appeared to be accelerating, the number of jet orders was unlikely to approach the records of the three-year boom that was ended by the global recession that began in 2008. But Monday’s tally was already several times greater than the roughly $7 billion in deals struck at the Paris Airshow in 2009.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/business/global/20aeroflot.html?ref=boeingcompany">Russia’s Aeroflot Is Pressed to Buy Domestic<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>MOSCOW — Aeroflot, the national airline of the Soviet Union, and now Russia, has defied stereotypes, transforming itself into a stylish choice for European business travelers by retraining staff members and importing airplanes.That it now flies a nearly all-Western fleet pleases passengers — but not, apparently, the Russian government. This month in a public meeting, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin sharply criticized Aeroflot’s chief executive for not buying more Russian-made jets. “You want to dominate the domestic market, but you don’t want to buy Russian technology,” Mr. Putin told the executive, Vitaly Savelyev. “That won’t do.” Mr. Savelyev replied that Aeroflot was buying 30 Russian-made jets, and would inherit a good many more when a planned merger with a half-dozen regional carriers was completed this year. Mr. Putin spoke during an apparently stage-managed meeting, broadcast on state television. But there was nothing artificial about the message, delivered just two weeks before the jet industry’s largest international trade show opened Monday at Farnborough, near London: Russian airlines will be under pressure to buy Russian jets. Aeroflot declined to comment for this article on its purchasing policies or on Mr. Putin’s discussion with Mr. Savelyev. For a decade, Russian airlines have been steady customers of foreign aircraft makers. Aeroflot’s fleet consists mainly of Airbus A320s and A330s and Boeing 767s. And the airline has orders for an additional 44 Boeings and Airbuses, even as the Russian authorities are trying to salvage the country’s civilian jet makers — Tupolev, Ilyushin, Antonov and Yak. Experts say that Russian airplanes are well constructed. Poor maintenance and repair records, however, earned them a bad reputation for safety after the Soviet Union collapsed. And, as any passenger can attest, they are more noisy and cramped than their Western rivals. Last year, Aeroflot sold to smaller Russian airlines its Tupolev jets, the workhorse passenger aircraft of the former East Bloc. Now, only six of about 110 jets in its fleet are Russian made. Those planes, Ilyushin Il-96s, which carry about 260 passengers, fly within Russia and to a few select foreign destinations, including Havana and Hanoi. Meanwhile, Aeroflot for the first time this year won recognition for the best business-class service on long-haul flights among the seven European airlines in the SkyTeam alliance, beating out the likes of Air France in pampering rich travelers, according to a SkyTeam customer survey. The Russian government merged the aircraft manufacturing industry into a single company, United Aircraft Corporation, or U.A.C., in 2006, bringing back under one roof the design and manufacturing functions that had become separated during privatization. Yet the company has few offerings for large carriers like Aeroflot. Russia has three passenger jet models flying commercially and still in production, with another expected to become available at the end of the year and a medium-haul plane on the drawing board. The Tu-204, a 180-passenger upgrade in the Tupolev family of passenger planes, costs vastly more to maintain than, for example, similarly sized Boeing 767s operated by Aeroflot. Russia is also manufacturing an aircraft, the An-148 regional jet, based on a Ukrainian design. The 75-seat aircraft, with its wing mounted above the fuselage, is a niche product — a passenger jet designed to fly from poorly surfaced airfields. It is certified to fly in Russia, but not in Europe or the United States. . Ilyushin is still technically producing long-haul, wide-body Il-96s, though none are on order by a civilian airline. Owning more Il-96 would poorly suit Aeroflot because the plane does not comply with European Union noise regulations. The civilian aircraft arm of Sukhoi, the aerospace company best known for its fighter jets, is working with the Italian aerospace giant Finmeccanica on the first major new commercial aviation project since the end of the Soviet Union, the Sukhoi Superjet, a regional aircraft. Aeroflot has ordered 30 of the jets, which seat about 100 passengers, for short-hop flights. Eighteen are in various stages of production, and four test planes are flying. Listed at $31.7 million, it is comparably priced to the Brazilian Embraer ERJ190 and more than $20 million cheaper than the Canadian Bombardier CRJ1000, both of which are about the same size as the Superjet. Sukhoi says it has, in total, 101 firm orders and expects an additional 30 to be signed at the Farnborough International Airshow, where one of the prototype aircraft will fly, said Olga Kayukova, a spokeswoman. The first three production planes will be delivered this year. The most recent Russian civilian aircraft project, a 150-seat airliner that would compete with the Airbus A320 family, is the first to reflect the Russian industry’s reorganization and is planned to enter serial production in 2015. It bears the working designation of MS-21, a Russian abbreviation for airliner for the 21st century, rather than the brand of any of the existing Russian aircraft companies. Maxim Syssoev, a spokesman for United Aircraft Corporation, said the company was showing a mockup of several rows of seats from the MS-21 cabin at Farnborough but was counting on Russian airlines as its “base market.” Even robust sales in Russia, however, would hardly justify the tremendous cost of designing and developing a new aircraft. At its peak, the Soviet industry produced 250 passenger jetliners a year; now it produces a few dozen at best. For production to be ramped up, Mr. Syssoev said, the airplanes would at least have to attract customers like Aeroflot to have a hope of finding success elsewhere. “U.A.C. should make a product the airlines will choose, on a competitive basis,” Mr. Syssoev said. “Nobody is going to force airlines to buy airplanes.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/global/19plane.html?ref=boeingcompany">Emirates Could Buy Up to 30 Boeing 777 Jets<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>Boeing obtained an order for up to 30 of its wide-body 777 jets from Emirates Airline of Dubai in a deal that would be worth nearly $7 billion at list prices, industry officials said Sunday.The deal, to be announced on Monday at the Farnborough Air Show in Britain, is a sign that commercial aviation, and Boeing’s fortunes, are starting to recover from the global recession.

The sharpest growth and demand for new planes will occur in the Middle East and China. The United States and Europe are expected to rebound more slowly.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/global/19iht-ravspace.html?ref=boeingcompany">New Mission for American Aerospace Giants<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>NEW YORK — For Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the other aerospace giants that have been the backbone of the American space effort for decades, the shift in U.S. space policy announced by President Barack Obama means a major change in mission.After working for decades with largely one customer — the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration — to ferry astronauts and equipment into orbit, major players in the aerospace industry are facing a commercial market with a range of entrepreneurs who say they can do that work for less. Under Mr. Obama’s ambitious initiative, NASA would rely on commercial companies to provide a kind of taxi service to the International Space Station, while focusing its efforts on missions into deep space with international partners. How the aerospace industry establishment will fit into this new plan remains far from clear, analysts say. “I see a certain analogy with what happened when computers went from being room-sized to being on the desktop,” said Louis D. Friedman, executive director for Planetary Society, a space exploration advocacy group. “Some companies barely survived, while others adapted and thrived. I think we are going to see something like this in the aerospace industry.” The most immediate effect of the proposed policy shift will be on jobs. Mr. Obama’s plan to cancel the Constellation program, started five years ago by President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon, could mean the end of nearly 12,600 jobs, according to estimates by aerospace contractors. The cuts would fall most heavily on Alabama, California, Florida, Texas and Utah, and political opposition from those states has been vociferous. The Constellation program has already cost American taxpayers about $9 billion. The end of Constellation would largely stop work on the Ares I rocket, which was to replace the space shuttle for carrying astronauts into orbit and would scale back work on the Orion crew capsule, which was to ride atop the Ares I. Lockheed Martin said more than 2,000 jobs depended on the Orion program, while Boeing said 1,500 jobs would be affected by the retirement of the space shuttle and the canceling of Constellation. Alliant Techsystems, known as ATK, said the ending of Ares I would put 5,000 jobs at risk at its plants and those of its subcontractors. Mr. Obama has said that the changes do not amount to a retreat from manned spaceflight and that adding private entrepreneurs to the mix will create a more vibrant industry with more astronauts in space and more business for established companies and newcomers alike. One established player that appears to accept Mr. Obama’s plan is United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company, whose Atlas and Delta rockets have carried military and commercial satellites into space for decades, said it had no plans to cut any jobs. “Just the opposite,” a U.L.A. spokesman said. “The president’s new plan could have a significant increase in demand coming from NASA and could create new jobs at U.L.A.,” the spokesman said, adding that U.L.A.’s long record of successful launchings made it “very different from new entrants.” One new entrant much on the minds of the aerospace community is Space Exploration Technologies, founded by Elon Musk, the Internet entrepreneur who helped found the payment system PayPal. The company, which did not exist a decade ago, has $2.5 billion in contracts, including $1.6 billion from NASA to provide a minimum of 12 flights to deliver cargo to the space station starting in 2011. The company, known as SpaceX, bolstered the credibility of Mr. Obama’s plan by launching into orbit last month the Falcon 9, a rocket measuring 158 feet, or 48 meters, and weighing 735,000 pounds, or 335,000 kilograms. The rocket, which the company said cost about $50 million, put a model of its Dragon capsule into orbit about 160 miles, or 260 kilometers, above the Earth without a hitch — an unusual development for a maiden flight. SpaceX, which plans to launch a fully operational rocket and capsule this summer before sending one to the International Space Station next year, said the successful June trial was a major victory “for NASA’s plan to use commercial rockets for astronaut transport.” The part of Mr. Obama’s plan that calls for missions that leave the Earth’s orbit to explore deep space will probably not be spelled out for several years. Mr. Obama has said that NASA will start developing a heavy-lift rocket for deep-space missions by 2015. That gap of several years between the planned end of the Constellation program and the start of work on a new heavy-lift vehicle does not please the aerospace contractors, who say they could shift at least some workers who might otherwise be laid off into a new deep-space program. It is also dangerous, some analysts say, because after canceling the Ares I, the United States would have no backup rocket if new commercial companies failed to deliver on their promises. “It’s a risky strategy,” said Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group financed in part by military contractors. “Our capacity to send man-rated rockets into space is at risk.” In a statement in response to Mr. Obama’s April 15 speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida outlining his new policy, Boeing emphasized the need for immediate development of a heavy-lift vehicle. “We have the technology and the people to commence development of these vehicles now,” Boeing said. Accelerated development of a deep-space launching vehicle and capsule “could achieve maximum benefit for American tax dollars by drawing on the cutting-edge technology already being developed for the Constellation program,” Boeing said. John M. Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said he had no doubt that NASA would contract for a heavy-lift vehicle sometime in the next few years and that the traditional aerospace companies would get the bulk of this work. “But in the short-term, they stand to lose the contracts for Constellation and all that goes with it,” he said “They are trading contracts in hand for some very uncertain contracts in the future.”</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/global/19iht-ravcivil.html?ref=boeingcompany">Airlines Focus on Revival<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>Early this month, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the chief executive of Air France, invited Airbus and Boeing to offer proposals, with prices, for perhaps 100 mid-size, long-range aircraft in the extra-wide-bodied A350 and the Boeing 787 families, to be delivered over the coming decade.Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, meanwhile, speaking in Berlin last month, said that the international airline would push ahead with its planned fleet expansion. The airline has ordered 176 new planes for delivery in the next eight years, including 143 wide-bodied jets, while planning to retire 68 of the older aircraft in its present fleet of 148 planes. If it sticks to its plan, its fleet will grow by more than one plane a month for years to come. In May, Emirates, which is based in Dubai, reported a fivefold rise in net profit for 2009-10, to 3.5 billion dirhams, or $953 million, and forecast earnings for this year of 4.25 billion dirhams. On Aug. 1, it will add Madrid to its rapidly expanding route network, joining its regional competitors Etihad, based in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar Airways, which flies to both Madrid and Barcelona. The Gulf-based airlines are scrambling to tap into a rising flow of traffic from the Iberian Peninsula via their respective hub airports to destinations across the Indian subcontinent, East Asia and Australasia. As senior executives of the major aerospace companies and their airline customers gather in Farnborough for the coming air show, the mood is upbeat again, and talk is centering on an industry revival. A presentation this month by Randy Tinseth, marketing vice president of Boeing’s commercial aircraft division, succinctly presents the case for being bullish long-term. The presentation, in graphic chart form, shows that world air travel has grown by 5 percent annually since 1977, the year before U.S. airlines were deregulated. The chart includes a trend line moving steadily through the one trillion Revenue-Passenger-Kilometers mark in 1979 to about 4.4 trillion in 2008, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of the global financial crisis. Yet, analysts with an eye on more recent history are a lot less sanguine. In the past two months markets have wobbled and U.S. economic growth has weakened, raising new fears of a double-dip recession. In Europe, governments worried about a sovereign debt crisis have reversed track on stimulus policies and started to cut spending. Within this overall context of economic uncertainty, industry-specific indicators and news developments scarcely support the image of aviation as a long-term growth industry. For one thing, the industry is shedding jobs, at least in mature markets. U.S. industry headcount figures show that worldwide employment by U.S. airlines in March, at 377,261, was the lowest since at least 1990. For another, the industry seems to be losing its battle with critics of its environmental impact. The European Union is making reluctant airlines join its five-year-old emissions trading system in 2012, and in May the newly elected British coalition government, taking a stand against “binge flying,” canceled plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Justifying its decision by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the government also ruled out additional runways at London’s secondary airports, Gatwick and Stansted. Vaughn Cordle, chief analyst for AirlineForecasts, a consulting firm in Washington, bluntly calls the industry a “wealth destroyer.” Mr. Cordle, a former airline captain who tracks the financial reports of 31 carriers, says 60 percent of the passenger lines lost money in the past 10 years. Over the 11 quarters from July 2007 through March this year, American Airlines had a net loss equivalent to 10.2 percent of its gross revenue. The net loss margin at United Airlines was 7.2 percent of gross revenue, while USAirways reported a 7.7 percent negative figure. Southwest, often cited as a role model for low-cost carriers, eked out a slim net profit margin equivalent to just 1.9 percent of its revenue. But Virgin America, which went public in 2007, racked up net losses of $424 million on gross revenues of $1.1 billion — a 38 percent negative margin, and the worst result among the 31 airlines in Mr. Cordle’s database. Still, Michael Richter, head of the aerospace and defense group at Lazard in Los Angeles, says he sees some signs of better times ahead. “We are not out of the weeds,” he said in an interview late last month, but “perhaps at the bottom, perhaps floating around the bottom. “There has been a reduction in aircraft order cancellations. Total global traffic is back to pre-crash levels,” Mr. Richter said. “Boeing is increasing the 737 production rate by early 2012. After earlier significant layoffs, employment is stabilizing. Aircraft financing is improving very significantly.” Mr. Richter said he had seen a rise in merger and acquisition interest in the aerospace sector since March and an increased availability of both equity and debt financing.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/global/19iht-ravover.html?ref=boeingcompany">Bumpy Ride Ahead for Air Industries<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>The skies appear to be clearing for international aviation as the recession of the past two years slips into history. But big challenges remain for the global airline industry and aircraft makers.Airline traffic in May rose above its 2008 pre-recession peak, and the International Air Transport Association, which earlier predicted a $2.8 billion loss for its members this year, revised its forecast last month to show a $2.5 billion combined profit. “Passenger traffic is now 1 percent above prerecession levels, while the freight market is 6 percent bigger,” Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of the association, said last month in Geneva. Yet, if traffic is back to prerecession levels, passenger and cargo revenues are not. Passenger load factors — a measure of seat occupancy — now typically average about 85 percent, compared with 70 percent to 75 percent before the recession. That, however, is partly because airlines have pared their operating fleets; and recession-wary customers are paying lower fares. Hard-pressed airlines have also been merging, rationalizing route structures and consolidating their fleets. Examples in Europe include Air France’s merger with KLM; Lufthansa’s with Swissair; and British Airways’ with Iberia. In the United States, Delta’s recently completed merger with Northwest is being followed by United and Continental, which hope to combine by the end of the year. At the same time, apart from permanently decommissioned older aircraft, many currently retired planes are only temporarily grounded, to be returned to service before any new orders are placed. And at the next level of consolidation, airline alliances like SkyTeam, Oneworld and Star Alliance are increasingly seeking joint venture antitrust immunity to plan, schedule and operate their Atlantic and Pacific operations, further rationalizing service frequencies and routes and reducing their need for new aircraft. For the aircraft manufacturers and jet engine makers, none of this is good news. Thrifty customers are not the only challenge facing the plane makers. A history of tit-for-tat complaints to the World Trade Organization is also coming home to roost. W.T.O. actions filed in 2004 by the United States and the European Commission alleged unfair trade practices benefiting Airbus and Boeing, including European “launch aid” loans for new Airbus models, and U.S. military research contracts for Boeing, along with other subsidies and tax breaks. A report on the U.S. case against Airbus, published by the W.T.O.’s dispute settlement panel late last month, specifically condemned some fundamental European practices. A parallel report, on E.U. complaints against Boeing, due for publication Friday, has been postponed to September. European frustration over the delay will likely add extra edge to the high profile competition between Airbus and Boeing for leadership in the airliner market, which has become a feature of the Farnborough and Paris air shows. In the past, that fight has been accompanied by an equally intense smaller-scale contest between Bombardier, of Canada, and Embraer, of Brazil, on the regional jet transport scene. Recently, however, that tidy division of the market, and its main players, into distinct segments has become increasingly blurred, first with the emergence of Embraer’s E-170 and E-190 family of four medium-range passenger jets in the 70- to 120-seat sector — straddling the regional and mainstream markets — and then with Bombardier’s definitive go-ahead for its C Series jet. Ending a four-year hesitation waltz, Bombardier finally decided in July 2008 to produce the C series in two sizes. The larger 300 version aims to compete directly with the Boeing 737-700 and Airbus A319, while the smaller 100 version is being sent out to do battle against the Embraer 190 and 195. The trigger for Bombardier’s decision, characterized by some analysts as an audacious declaration of commercial total war, actually was pulled by Pratt &amp; Whitney, the engine manufacturing unit of United Technologies, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace and defense analyst at Teal Group, in Fairfax, Virginia. Pratt &amp; Whitney has agreed to fit its GTF 1000 Geared TurboFan engine, intended to be significantly more fuel-efficient than existing power plants, to the Bombardier planes, giving them a potentially winning edge in a highly cost-conscious market. The C series challenge comes at a very inconvenient time for both Airbus and Boeing, which recently announced plans to step up production of their A320 and 737 aircraft families to meet future airline demand. Both would like to be able to keep profitably churning out those workhorse models — the backbone of short- and medium-haul airline fleets all over the world. Instead they may have to invest in modernizing their product lines. “The Big Two have been outmaneuvered by Pratt &amp; Whitney’s GTF, which has enabled Bombardier’s C Series to become a growing competitive threat,” Mr. Aboulafia said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E4D9123FF93BA25754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=boeingcompany">W.T.O. Ruling Upsets Chief Of Jet Maker<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>LONDON -- The chief executive of the parent company of Airbus expressed frustration over the weekend at a recent decision by the World Trade Organization to delay a report on European claims that Boeing has received billions of dollars in federal subsidies. ''We are in an abnormal and increasingly unfair situation,'' Louis Gallois, the chief of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, said on Saturday in an interview ahead of the Farnborough International Airshow, which opens Monday near London. He added later, ''We are in a very defensive mood.'' The report, originally expected last week, was postponed until mid-September after members of the organization's dispute panel asked for more time to review the case, which is one of the most complex ever brought. EADS formally submitted its bid this month for a $35 billion contract to supply aerial refueling tankers to the United States Air Force. Boeing is also bidding for the contract. Last month the W.T.O. ruled that Airbus had received illegal subsidies -- in the form of loans from European governments at below-market interest rates -- to build its commercial airplanes. The European Union is expected to appeal that ruling. However, the decision has fueled calls by Boeing's political supporters for the Pentagon to add to the EADS bid the estimated value of the subsidies Airbus received. Mr. Gallois lamented the timing of the W.T.O.'s delay ahead of a Defense Department deadline of Nov. 12 to choose a winner. The European Union estimates that Boeing has received more than $20 billion in illegal support from the United States government since the 1980s, of which $5 billion went to Boeing's latest plane, the 787 Dreamliner, which is due to enter service next year. EADS sees the Air Force tanker contract as crucial to its goal of expanding its revenues in the United States to $10 billion by 2020 from just over $1 billion today. ''It is the biggest market in the world,'' Mr. Gallois said. ''Clearly we have to be there.''</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/business/global/17airshow.html?ref=boeingcompany">At Air Show, the Economic View Depends on the Plane<date>Published: July 16, 2010</date><text>FARNBOROUGH, ENGLAND — For the executives arriving Monday at the Farnborough International Airshow, the expectations for this weeklong aerospace bazaar will probably depend on who their customers are.Makers of commercial airliners and their suppliers are undoubtedly encouraged by the accelerating pace of the economic recovery across most of the globe, counting on a renewed surge in demand for air travel to be translated soon into orders for new aircraft. Business jet manufacturers, too, have noted a modest upturn in corporate traffic since the start of the year. But for those who supply the world’s militaries, the environment has grown decidedly more challenging, with governments in the United States and Europe preparing sharp cuts in military spending as they seek to rein in ballooning budget deficits. Some analysts have begun to describe the downsizing of Western military budgets as the “new normal,” a trend that may have manufacturers looking to export more to emerging markets or to branch out into areas like space, security and civil nuclear businesses. “The industry is getting used to the idea that the massive buildup and modernization program for defense across the world for the last 15 years is over,” said Ian Godden, the chairman of ADS, a British aerospace and defense trade body that also owns Farnborough International, host to the biennial show, which takes place about an hour’s journey from London. With most of the industry still struggling to return to profit after a devastating 2009, financial constraints could reduce the number of international trade representatives attending the show. Those representatives traditionally make up about one-third of the total number there. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest military contractor, plans to reduce its presence by half, compared with the level in 2008, citing budget pressures. Yet the show’s organizers say exhibition space is sold out, with the overall number of companies registered this year slightly higher than the 1,400 who took part two years ago. Mr. Godden said he expected about 180,000 people to visit the show, which opens its gates to the public next Saturday and Sunday. “For every Lockheed, there is a China, Russia, Brazil or a Mexico that is sending bigger numbers,” Mr. Godden said, noting that nearly 10 percent of exhibitors will be coming to Farnborough for the first time. The world’s two major commercial jet makers, Airbus and Boeing, will be hoping to tap into renewed optimism about air travel after two years of devastating losses for most of the world’s airlines. Last month, the International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva, predicted that carriers would report a collective profit of $2.5 billion this year after recording a $9.9 billion loss in 2009 and a $16 billion loss in 2008. Global air transport demand rose above pre-recession levels in May, with a 12 percent increase in passenger traffic from the level of a year earlier and a 34 percent jump in cargo traffic, the I.A.T.A. said. “I think we can declare the recession over, both in terms of order book and production,” Mr. Godden said. “I think we’ll start to see orders rebuilding, starting this quarter, and then continue for the next three years.” Still, many caution that the recovery has been uneven and profit margins at most major carriers remain razor-thin, leaving little cash available for new aircraft purchases in the near term. “The year-to-date traffic statistics are still pretty weak,” said Phil Toy, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm in New York, noting that European carriers were still expected to lose about $2.8 billion this year. “European economies are still very weak, the U.S. economy is weak,” Mr. Toy said. “And at the end of the day, that is where the majority of travel takes place.” He noted that aircraft deliveries were still down 9 percent in the first quarter from the level of a year earlier, while new orders, which plunged 70 percent in 2009, have only partially recovered. Randy Tinseth, vice president for marketing at Boeing, said the U.S. plane maker would announce some new orders at Farnborough but predicted that airlines would not start looking to rebuild their fleets significantly until 2012. “As this year has gone by, everyone has gotten more positive about the market, but 2010 is still a year of economic recovery,” Mr. Tinseth said. Middle Eastern and Asian airlines have been among the few who have continued to purchase new planes during the recession as they have sought to extend their strategic reach around the globe. Emirates, the carrier based in Dubai, grabbed headlines last month, for example, when it announced a deal for 32 Airbus A380s, bringing its total number of orders for the two-deck superjumbo to 90 planes. “For the moment, we are seeing mainly the same type of airlines placing orders,” said Damien Lasou, a managing director at Accenture in Paris. “When we see airlines in Europe and North America starting to buy aircraft again, that will be for me the real confirmation of an upturn.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/business/global/16boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Lifts Long-Range Forecast<date>Published: July 15, 2010</date><text>PARIS — With air passenger and cargo traffic recovering steadily, Boeing on Thursday raised its long-range forecast for commercial aircraft demand, citing expectations of steady air traffic growth in Asia’s emerging markets and the rapid expansion of low-cost carriers in Europe. The U.S. plane maker predicted that airlines would buy 30,900 new jets through 2029. That represented an increase of 6.5 percent from its previous forecast of 29,000 planes made in June 2009, when order delays and cancellations by many carriers prompted Boeing and Airbus, its European rival, to consider slowing production to cope with the recession. Boeing, based in Chicago, said the new orders would be worth $3.6 trillion, up 12.5 percent from the $3.2 trillion forecast a year ago. “The world market is doing much better than last year, but there are still challenges,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president for marketing at Boeing’s commercial airplanes division. “We expect the world economy to grow above the long-term trend this year. As a result, both passenger and cargo travel will grow.” The 20-year forecast from Boeing was announced in advance of the Farnborough International Airshow, which opens Monday near London. It compares with one published by Airbus in September, which predicted sales of 25,000 commercial planes over the same period, with a market value of $3.1 trillion. But the Airbus forecast preceded the strong rebound air traffic that began early this year, driven by a revival in business travel. The International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva, predicted last month that carriers would report a collective profit of $2.5 billion this year after recording a $9.9 billion loss in 2009 and a $16 billion loss in 2008. Global air transport demand rose to above pre-recession levels in May, the most recent month available, with an 12 percent increase in passenger traffic from a year earlier and a 34 percent jump in cargo traffic, I.A.T.A. said. Boeing said it expected passenger traffic to grow at an annual rate of about 5.3 percent over the next two decades, slightly above the roughly 5 percent average rate over the past 30 years. Air cargo traffic was expected to grow at a 5.9 percent annual clip. The vast majority of new sales — around 69 percent — will be of single-aisle aircraft like the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, which normally seat around 150 passengers, Boeing said. Twin-aisle wide-bodies like Airbus’s planned A350-XWB and the forthcoming Boeing 787 “Dreamliner” will represent about 23 percent. For the first time, Boeing said the expected value of those single-aisle jet sales, at $1.7 trillion, would most likely exceed that of wide-bodies, which it estimated at roughly $1.4 trillion. Boeing put demand for large aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, which seat more than 400 passengers, at around 720 aircraft for the 20-year period, well below the estimate of 1,700 planes by Airbus, the maker of the 555-seat A380 “superjumbo.”Mr. Tinseth said single-aisle jets were expected to continue to appeal to fast-growing airlines in emerging markets — particularly in India, China and Southeast Asia — and low-cost carriers. The instability of fuel prices is also driving demand for smaller planes, he said. He noted that of the 1,300 existing planes that Boeing expects will be replaced with newer, more fuel-efficient models over the next 20 years, the majority would be single-aisle planes.Both Boeing and Airbus are expected to face challenges from smaller competitors in the 100-120 seat market in years to come. Bombardier of Canada is expected to introduce its 145-seat C-Series jet in 2012, for example, while Comac of China is developing the C919, a 190-seat plane due to enter service around 2015.Boeing forecast that the Asia-Pacific region would remain the most robust market for growth, led by China. “Today, about one-third of all airline traffic touches the Asia-Pacific region, and as a result of the growth in this market, by 2029 almost 43 percent of all traffic will be to, from, or within the region,” Mr. Tinseth said.Mr. Tinseth said that the proliferation of low-cost carriers would continue to be a driver of demand. In Europe, he predicted 20 percent of all available airline seats would be on low-cost airlines by 2029, a tenfold increase from 2000. Boeing said Thursday that the initial delivery of the 787 Dreamliner might be delayed until the first weeks of 2011 instead of coming later this year under the plane maker’s latest plan, Bloomberg News reported from London. The company is still working to get the twin-engine jet to the first customer, Japan’s All Nippon Airways, by the end of 2010, Scott Fancher, the 787 program chief, said during a conference call with reporters.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/business/10tanker.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Bids for Tanker, and Reshapes 767 Production<date>Published: July 9, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — As Boeing filed its bid on Friday for a $35 billion Air Force tanker contract, the company said it was changing the production line of its 767 jets to cut costs and better compete with a rival bid.Boeing’s bid was submitted a day after the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, the parent of Airbus, filed its paperwork for what could be the largest military contract awarded over the next several years. Both bids come slightly more than a week after a panel of the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus, which is owned by EADS, had received government subsidies to build its commercial planes. Boeing has complained that European support could help EADS undercut Boeing’s price on the aerial refueling tankers even though Boeing’s plane is smaller and would be expected to cost less. As a result, Boeing executives said they were reshaping the final assembly line for the 767, the model on which its tanker entry is based, to cut costs and speed production. The EADS tanker is a variant of Airbus’s A330-200 jet. The cost-cutting will help ensure that the Pentagon pays the lowest price for the tankers no matter which company wins the contract. “We are deeply concerned about the ability of Airbus and EADS to be able to accept the financial risk that a commercial company like Boeing cannot,” Jean Chamberlin, a Boeing vice president who manages its tanker program, said in an interview Friday. Ms. Chamberlin said Boeing feared that EADS could accept lower returns on the tanker contract and “turn in a proposal that we would have a difficult time matching.” EADS executives, however, have dismissed such concerns, saying that the subsidies cited by the trade panel — mainly low-interest loans to help Airbus develop planes — were irrelevant to the tanker contest. Pentagon officials have refused to consider the subsidies in evaluating the tanker bids, even though Boeing’s supporters in Congress have been clamoring for them to do so. Ralph Crosby, the chairman of EADS North America, said on Thursday that even though its plane was larger, his company could compete with Boeing because its jet was more modern and efficient and the commercial version was still being produced in larger numbers than the 767. Referring to the complaints about subsidies, he said Boeing’s supporters were “wasting a lot of time trying to derail a process because their plane is inferior.” Boeing plans to replace the 767 in its commercial lineup with the new 787 Dreamliner, and it is making the changes in the 767 assembly line as it clears space in its factory in Everett, Wash., to increase Dreamliner production.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D61039F93AA35754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=boeingcompany">European Plane Maker Submits Bid for U.S. Tankers<date>Published: July 9, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company submitted an 8,800-page bid on Thursday for a $35 billion Air Force tanker contract amid tensions over whether European subsidies would give it a cost advantage over Boeing. Boeing, based in Chicago, plans to file its bid Friday, and the Pentagon will pick the winner under a formula that amounts to a shootout over the lowest price. The bids are being submitted about a week after a panel of the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus had received subsidies -- in the form of loans from European governments at below-market interest rates -- to build its commercial airplanes. That ruling has fueled calls by Boeing's political supporters for the Pentagon to add to the Airbus bid price the estimated value of the subsidies on the Airbus A330-200 -- the model on which the EADS tanker is based. But Ralph Crosby, the chairman of EADS North America, said Thursday that Boeing supporters were ''wasting a lot of time trying to derail a process because their airplane is inferior.'' Mr. Crosby said the A330 had beaten Boeing's 767 in the commercial jet market because it was more modern and efficient. The Pentagon has said its main concern is to get the best deal. The companies have fought over the contract, for 179 planes, for several years. The contract could eventually be extended to cover 400 to 500 planes worth $100 billion. EADS, which owns Airbus, and Northrop Grumman won a similar contest in 2008, but government auditors overturned the award because of problems with how the bids were judged. Northrop dropped out of the partnership earlier this year, saying it did not see how the larger, and normally more expensive, Airbus plane could win against the Boeing tanker, which would be based on the midsize 767 jet. EADS decided to go forward on its own after the Pentagon extended the deadline and President Obama promised Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, that the bidding would be fair. The W.T.O. ruling, which is subject to appeal, concluded that Airbus would have been a ''much weaker'' company with enormous debts without the low-interest loans from European governments. It added that, without the aid, the A330-200 ''could not have been launched when it was without significantly higher costs.'' Airbus executives are hoping that the W.T.O. will find that Boeing also benefited from subsidies when it rules on a countersuit filed by the European Union. W.T.O. officials said Thursday that an interim ruling in that case, which had been expected on July 16, would be delayed until September. The chief executive, Thomas O. Enders, called the delay a disappointment but said he remained confident that it would show that Boeing had received billions of dollars in illegal subsidies. Given the economic troubles, the other big issue is jobs. Boeing asserted that it and its suppliers on the tanker would provide 50,000 jobs in the United States. EADS, which said it would assemble its tankers in Alabama, maintained that it could supply almost as many. Mr. Crosby said that if EADS, which now builds its tankers in France, won the contest, it would begin doing the final assembly in Mobile on the fourth tanker. Sean O'Keefe, the chief executive of EADS North America, said cheaper operating costs in Alabama could also enable EADS to lower its price. He said EADS would also gain efficiencies by building commercial freighters in the new Mobile plant. This would also represent a beachhead in the commercial market that Boeing would like to prevent.

Says Subsidies Helped Airbus to Best Boeing<date>Published: June 30, 2010</date><text>The United States won an “important victory” in a trade ruling that Airbus, the European plane maker, had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies, taking sales from Boeing as a result, the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said on Wednesday.The ruling, by the World Trade Organization, immediately fueled concerns in Congress about whether the Pentagon should consider the subsidies in deciding whether to award a $40 billion contract for refueling tankers to Boeing or Airbus’s parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS. Boeing, based in Chicago, has long contended that the subsidies helped Airbus vault past it in 2003 to become the world’s largest plane maker. The 1,200-page ruling concluded that Airbus received subsidies — in the form of loans from European governments at below-market interest rates — to produce its six best-selling models. The trade panel recommended that steps be taken to withdraw the subsidies or nullify their effects. From the start of its first A300 jet in 1969, with interest-free financing from France and Germany, to the creation of its new A380 superjumbo jet, the trade panel concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all of these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,” without the subsidies. The ruling said that if the European company had had to rely on commercial financing, at interest rates as high as 15 to 16 percent in the early years, “the increase in the level of debt Airbus would have accumulated over the years would have been massive.” It said Airbus would have been a “much weaker” company and probably could not have afforded to build the A380. The ruling, which was outlined in broad terms in March but not released fully until Wednesday, found that the Airbus A310, A320, A330 and A340 models were also developed largely with low-interest government loans. EADS is bidding for the Pentagon tanker contract with a version of the A330. Pentagon officials have said they want to get the most competitive price for the tankers, and they will not consider the impact of the subsidies in choosing between Boeing and EADS. “Today’s ruling confirms what I have been saying for years: Airbus’s illegal subsidies have harmed American workers and businesses, and they need to end,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, where Boeing assembles many of its planes. Contrasting the trade representative’s stance with that of the Pentagon, she added: “It makes no sense for one part of the U.S. government to be fighting illegal subsidies, while another is pretending they don’t exist.” Boeing executives also hope that the political pressure created by the ruling will keep Europe from going ahead with similar loans to help Airbus develop the A350, which is meant to compete with Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner passenger jet. The trade ruling does not apply to $4.3 billion in European governments’ loan pledges for the A350, since work on it had not begun when the complaint was filed. But Mr. Kirk, the United States trade representative, “has made clear that he would be very disappointed if any member states moved forward with disbursing aid for the A350,” his general counsel, Timothy Reif, said. Karel De Gucht, the European Union’s trade commissioner, said he was disappointed by some of the trade panel’s findings. He said European officials would decide soon whether to appeal the ruling. “The E.U. remains committed to a negotiated outcome to the dispute with no preconditions on either side,” he said. United States officials said they were able to prevail by showing that Boeing had lost market share in foreign countries because the subsidies enabled Airbus to offer more models than it otherwise could have. The United States claimed that European governments gave Airbus about $15 billion in low-interest loans, and the W.T.O. panel found that Airbus also benefited from several billion dollars in other subsidies, like runway construction and research grants. The trade panel also found that some of the European loans on the A380 were meant to promote export sales. Under the trade rules, that type of subsidy would need to be withdrawn within 90 days if the full W.T.O. ratified the panel’s findings. Airbus supporters said the trade panel had rejected some of the claims by the United States, including one that the A330-200 — the plane on which the EADS refueling tanker is based — also benefited from a loan tied to export sales. But the trade panel still found that the A330-200s were unfairly subsidized. It said other low-interest loans had made the entire A330 series possible, and without them, “the A330-200 could not have been launched when it was without significantly higher costs.” Boeing officials have said they fear the subsidies could allow EADS to undercut their price in the tanker competition even though the A300-200 is larger than Boeing’s plane. Some of Boeing’s backers in Congress have called on the Pentagon to add the estimated value of the subsidies to the EADS bid price. President Obama recently promised Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, that the bidding would be fair. EADS officials contended on Wednesday that the competition should not be altered. The European Union also has brought its own case before the W.T.O., claiming that Boeing has benefited from more than $20 billion in subsidies since the 1980s from its military business and tax breaks. A preliminary ruling in that case is expected in mid-July.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E6DB103CF932A35754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=boeingcompany">Boeing to Buy a Maker Of Intelligence Systems<date>Published: July 1, 2010</date><text>Boeing said on Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire a combat engineering firm, Argon ST, for about $775 million as it seeks Pentagon contracts for high-tech intelligence tools. The Pentagon has been cutting back on orders for some weapons meant for conventional wars. Instead, it has been shopping for technology better suited to fight against shadowy insurgent groups in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Argon, based in Fairfax, Va., develops a variety of systems used in surveillance, reconnaissance and combat. That includes reconnaissance equipment mounted on planes, sensors meant to warn of an approaching enemy and special sights to help troops locate snipers in urban warfare. Earlier this week, Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary, said he planned to save up to 3 percent annually on defense contracts by pushing companies to cut overhead. The deal shows the willingness of big contractors to make acquisitions as they try to match the Pentagon's shifting priorities, said Brian W. Ruttenbur, an analyst for Morgan Keegan. ''We believe companies in this space are attractive targets for the larger defense contractors who all have strong balance sheets but are facing slowing growth opportunities,'' he wrote in a research note. Boeing's offer of $34.50 a share is a 41 percent premium to Argon's closing price on Tuesday. Argon said its board had approved the takeover and planned to recommend it to shareholders. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Once acquired, Argon will be a stand-alone subsidiary of Boeing. Argon had $366 million in revenue during the 2009 fiscal year. It has about 1,000 employees and operates in several states. The company's chief executive, Terry Collins, was the largest shareholder with a 12.4 percent ownership stake as of a company regulatory filing in January. He stands to make $93.7 million on his shares if the deal goes through at the proposed price. Boeing shares fell 29 cents, to $62.75 on Wednesday, while Argon shares rose 40 percent, or $9.86, to $34.29.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/business/28boeing.html?ref=boeingcompany">Boeing Reaches Deal With Union, Averting a Strike<date>Published: June 28, 2010</date><text>ST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing workers in St. Louis have accepted a contract with the plane manufacturer, avoiding a strike that would have gone into effect on Monday if the deal had been rejected.The union representing the employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said the contract passed Sunday by a vote of 1,237 to 838. The union had said its workers in St. Louis were prepared to strike starting at midnight if the vote had failed. The main contention against the proposal was a clause that would place workers hired after January 2012 in a retirement plan based on company contributions instead of in a traditional pension. A union spokesman, Tom Pinski, said that clause remained in place. The newly approved four-and-a-half year contract, however, removes language that would have dropped an employee’s dependent health care coverage if the worker took a medical leave of absence for more than six months. The new contract allows for 30 months of coverage. Boeing said in a statement that it was pleased the contract was passed. The contract covers more than 2,500 Boeing workers, most of them in St. Louis, as well as operations in Maryland and other locations. The workers make the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft and the F-15 Strike Eagle ground attack strike fighter as well as parts for the C-17 Air Force cargo plane. Earlier this month, a monthlong strike by Boeing workers at the Chicago-based company’s C-17 plant in Long Beach, Calif., ended after workers approved a contract there. The strike had shut down production of the military cargo jets. Boeing endured an eight-week strike in late 2008 that shut down commercial airplane production and was a factor in delays for its new 787 and a new version of its 747. That machinists union walkout covered some 27,000 Boeing employees in Washington State, Oregon and Kansas.</text></article></page></root>
