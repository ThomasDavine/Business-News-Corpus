Not Exactly<date>October 24, 2011, 11:33 am</date><text>Tom PoteatA New York City taxi medallion was found by Tom Poteat near his apartment in Midtown Manhattan. A few hours after our article about the million-dollar taxi medallion sale hit newsstands on Friday, we received a call from Tom Poteat, a cheerful fellow who had found himself in an odd predicament. The other week, strolling near his apartment in Midtown, Mr. Poteat said he heard a clanging by his feet. He looked down to see a medallion, unattached to its taxi, lying on the sidewalk. The thought crossed his mind that he could paint a car yellow, bolt down the medallion “and start charging people,” Mr. Poteat recalled. “But the reality is it should be back in the hands of its rightful owner,” he said. He took the medallion home, where it has been residing since. “I just didn’t want it to go into the wrong hands,” Mr. Poteat said. “I know these things were very valuable.” Actually, it turns out the medallion part of a taxi medallion is not worth quite as much as what it represents. Operating a yellow cab in New York City? Worth a cool million. The aluminum plate itself? “About 10 bucks,” said Allan J. Fromberg, a taxi commission spokesman. It is apparently not unusual for medallions to be lost, either pried off by vandals or simply discarded. “We’ve gotten calls like that before,” Mr. Fromberg said. “The owner can call the city for a replacement.” He pointed out that retired medallions from previous years can be purchased as a souvenir from the city store. “It probably wouldn’t be terribly difficult for you to find medallions that have been converted into wall clocks,” Mr. Fromberg said. Mr. Poteat, meanwhile, tried to get in touch with the medallion’s owner, to no avail. A call he placed to the taxi commission was not returned. Even the Internet seemed at a loss. “I go to Google, type in ‘process for a lost taxicab medallion,’ and there’s really not anything there,” he said. So far, he has made no decisions on the medallion’s fate. But his friends have been suitably impressed. As one put it last week: “So, what are you going to do with the million dollars?” A Glittering Who’s Who at the Chairman’s Final Stop JAY H. WALDER‘s farewell party on Friday night at Café Centro on East 45th Street featured a glittering who’s who of the city’s transit elite, including the city transportation commissioner, JANETTE SADIK-KHAN, and the deputy director of transportation alternatives, NOAH BUDNICK. The $70-a-plate, R.S.V.P.-only soiree took place on the first floor of the MetLife Building, around the corner from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Madison Avenue headquarters, which Mr. Walder, the authority’s departing chairman, recently put on the selling block. Mainstays of the agency’s executive staff, like construction chief MICHAEL HORODNICEANU and deputy director LINDA G. KLEINBAUM, put in an appearance, along with family and friends of Mr. Walder, who is about to leave for his new job in Hong Kong. The smartly attired crowd, sated by a full open bar and trays of delicate hors d’oeuvres, appeared happy and festive — save for a scowling restaurant hostess who informed us that the event was private and not open to the press.

And each time, it said no.Nothing was better, year after year, than having the MetLife blimp, Snoopy 1, floating above major sports events. Nothing produced a better return on investment. “The blimp is a flexible, roving stadium,” said Beth Hirschhorn, MetLife’s chief marketing officer, “which is why it was difficult for any property to compare.” MetLife made a big leap beyond Peanuts characters and airship advertising a few years ago when it became one of four cornerstone partners at New Meadowlands Stadium. The home of the Jets and the Giants was still in blueprints at the time, but Hirschhorn thought that owning the equivalent of marketing real estate at the stadium was worth the life insurer’s investment of $7 million to $8 million a year. But on Tuesday, MetLife took the next step and it acquired the name of the stadium. MetLife Stadium joins a region populated by CitiField, Prudential Center and Red Bull Arena. Its deal is for 25 years and is worth $17 million to $20 million annually. The money will be split between the Giants and the Jets, who financed construction of the stadium. Why would a widely recognized insurer need to have its name on the stadium? Three reasons, Hirschhorn said: for the media exposure that a stadium in the New York market with two N.F.L. teams and a Super Bowl in 2014 can bring; for the connection that it will have with fans; and for the dynamism that football brings to the stodgy world of life insurance. “MetLife has near ubiquitous brand awareness,” Hirschhorn said. “This helps raise our top of mindedness.” The Giants and the Jets have searched for nearly three years to find a company to buy the stadium’s naming rights since almost selling them to Allianz, a German insurer, for more than MetLife is paying. After a report in The New York Times about Allianz’s ties to the Third Reich, the advanced talks fell apart. Then the recession hit, which dampened the naming-rights market and forced teams to bide their time in hopes that a corporation would pay what they were charging. “We reached out to hundreds of companies,” said John Brody, principal of global sales and business development at the Wasserman Media Group, which helped the teams find a buyer for the stadium name. “MetLife is a company with the ideals the teams desired.” Among the other companies solicited beside MetLife were the stadium’s other cornerstone partners: Bud Light, Verizon and Pepsi. Steve Tisch, the chairman of the Giants, said, “I can’t honestly remember a company that we got to first base with” until MetLife. The deal was signed in time for announcers to start calling it MetLife Stadium for Saturday night’s Jets-Giants game, but it will be a few weeks until the four giant illuminated signs outside the stadium will be erected. And at MetLife’s section of the stadium, a statue of Lucy Van Pelt trying to throw a pass. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 24, 2011 An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of Red Bull Arena by calling it Red Bull Stadium.One after another, MetLife was asked to buy stadium and naming rights. And each time, it said no.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/to-combat-lax-sales-g-m-offers-free-insurance-to-buyers-in-pacific-northwest/?ref=metlifeinc">To Combat Lax Sales, G.M. Offers Free Insurance to Buyers in Pacific Northwest<date>July 7, 2011, 7:50 pm</date><text>You might remember the car-dealer refrain, “Buy a car, get a check,” or those once-ubiquitous friends and family discounts. In the Pacific Northwest, General Motors is putting another twist on the incentive game, offering a year of free car insurance. This week, G.M. began a pilot program in Oregon and Washington that bundled a yearlong insurance policy, provided through MetLife Auto and Home, with a customer’s purchase of a new 2010, 2011 or 2012 model-year vehicle. The program, which runs through Sept. 6, is intended to increase G.M.’s market share in the Pacific Northwest, where dealers say they are not experiencing the same rebound in auto sales that their counterparts in other regions have experienced. “We’re light on traffic right now,” said Terry Olson, general manager of Braley &amp; Graham Buick GMC in Portland, Ore., in a telephone interview. “We always take some time to recover.” Buyers in the region are also more loyal to foreign brands, according to a recent survey by CarGurus.com, which examined buying behaviors of customers from January through June. While 67 percent of buyers in St. Louis and Detroit bought cars from domestic brands, only 37 percent of buyers in Portland and 34 percent of Seattle buyers did. Tom Henderson, a G.M. spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the insurance incentive was offered partly because the company’s data identified 23 percent of potential buyers on the West Coast lacked the financial means to acquire a policy. Brad Preble, a vice president with Carr Chevrolet in Beaverton, Ore., said that a common component of his sales staff’s work involved getting monthly payments to a point where customers could afford them in tandem with insurance payments. “When we’re working with people on a budget, we have to factor that into the equation,” Mr. Preble said in a telephone interview. “To the extent that it can go away, that’s beneficial.” Mr. Olson in Portland said affordability was not a major issue for his Buick and GMC customers, but he believed they nevertheless would appreciate a bargain. “When you buy a new $35,000 Buick or $55,000 GMC Denali, the insurance premium can be a fair amount,” he said. The insurance can be bundled with other deals as well. G.M. is offering incentives that average around $3,000 per vehicle, highest among major automakers according to Edmunds.com, but down significantly from the levels the company was offering in April and May. CarInsurance.com, which tracks insurance rates nationwide, reflects an average auto insurance premium in Washington State of $1,352 per year, while the average in Oregon is $1,189 — both below the national average of $1,440. According to MetLife, the policy covers the vehicle and anyone who drives it with the owner’s permission for a full year from the date of purchase, as long as the buyer still owns it. Mr. Olson said he expected the policy to appeal particularly to households with teenage drivers, who could be expensive to insure. If the car is totaled in the first year or first 15,000 miles, whichever comes first, MetLife would repair or replace it without deducting for depreciation. This is not the first time G.M. has used such an incentive. The automaker briefly offered a similar program a few years ago on the Chevrolet Cobalt in Wisconsin, according to Mr. Henderson, the company spokesman. “We’ll see if it resonates with buyers,” he said. “We’ll assess it after Sept. 6.” At least for now, G.M. does not intend to introduce it elsewhere, but Mr. Olson in Portland said he was convinced the program would draw customers to showrooms in any part of the country. “It’s our job to make sure it’s successful so that it can be rolled out nationally,” he said.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/nyregion/hilfiger-plans-a-manhattan-hotel.html?ref=metlifeinc">Hilfiger Plans a Manhattan Hotel<date>Published: May 5, 2011</date><text>Tommy Hilfiger, the designer known for his blue blazers and varsity sweaters, has signed a contract to buy the landmark Metropolitan Life clock tower for $170 million and plans to convert the building into a hotel, according to an executive briefed on the deal.Mr. Hilfiger, who sold his apparel company 14 months ago to Phillips-Van Heusen for $3 billion, had been scouring the city for a suitable building for almost a year. He had looked at the former headquarters of The New York Times on West 43rd Street before moving south to the clock tower, which overlooks Madison Square Park. In recent years, a string of developers have sought to convert the MetLife tower, at Madison Avenue and East 24th Street, which was modeled after St. Mark’s Campanile in Venice, to condominiums. Mr. Hilfiger has another idea: a hotel. “It’s certainly a landmark in a neighborhood that’s become more hotel-friendly in recent years,” John Fox, a hotel industry specialist at PKF Consulting, said. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what a Hilfiger brand hotel is. I assume it’s something with a preppy look to the design.” Mr. Fox said the hotel market was digesting the addition of 5,000 hotel rooms last year, and hotel room rates are rising. The deal was reported Thursday on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal. It is not expected to close for at least 60 days, said the executive briefed on the deal, who had no authorization to discuss the matter and was granted anonymity, and the agreement could still fall apart. Mr. Hilfiger would not be the first clothier to turn to hotels. Giorgio Armani has his name on, and is said to be designing, a chain of luxury hotels, starting with the Armani Hotel Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. The MetLife clock tower, which is 50 stories tall and capped by a gilded cupola, was the world’s tallest building for a few years after its completion in 1909. It has changed hands several times in recent years. SL Green bought the property from MetLife in 2005 for $150 million. The following year, Ian Schrager and RFR Holdings bought a 70 percent stake in the building, with plans to create luxurious apartments. In May 2007, the Israeli businessman Lev Leviev of Africa Israel USA bought the tower and additional development rights, saying he would spend $110 million on a condominium conversion. But the recession dealt a heavy blow to Mr. Leviev’s highly leveraged company. Africa Israel had also bought the former Times Building, and last week it sold 11 floors in that building to the Blackstone Group, the private equity company, for $160 million. “A hotel play is much safer than if he was planning a condo conversion,” Ben Thypin, director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics, said of Mr. Hilfiger. “There’s a lot of development action around Madison Square.”Tommy Hilfiger, the designer known for his blue blazers and varsity sweaters, has signed a contract to buy the landmark Metropolitan Life clock tower for $170 million and plans to convert the building into a hotel, according to an executive briefed on the deal.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/business/global/16insure.html?ref=metlifeinc">Japan’s Government Likely to Bear Much of the Loss<date>Published: March 15, 2011</date><text>Apart from an expected $35 billion in insurance claims from last week’s earthquake, the financial losses in Japan will probably fall most heavily on the Japanese government once it tallies the damage from the tsunami and the nuclear disaster.Japanese insurance companies, global insurers and reinsurers, hedge funds and other investors in catastrophe bonds are all expected to bear a portion of the losses that seem likely to exceed $100 billion. Total damage from the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, was estimated at $100 billion, according to the Insurance Information Institute, but only about $3 billion of that was covered by insurance. The greatest uncertainty surrounds contamination from the nuclear accident prompted by the earthquake and tsunami. Operators of nuclear plants in Japan are required to buy liability insurance through the Japan Atomic Energy Insurance Pool, an industry group. But they are required to buy coverage of only about $2.2 billion for liabilities, and the pool does not sell the utilities coverage for earthquake damage or business interruptions, suggesting it will again be up to the Japanese government to bear the brunt of those costs. The stocks of some United States life and health insurers with operations in Japan sank on Tuesday, as investors responded to Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s warnings that the risk of radiation exposure had worsened. The biggest loser was Aflac, which sells a popular line of cancer insurance in Japan, as well as other life and health coverage. Its stock fell 9.2 percent when the American markets opened Tuesday, before regaining somewhat and closing at $50.89, down 5.58 percent from Monday’s closing price of $53.90. About 75 percent of Aflac’s revenue came from Japan last year. “The market is looking at everything that’s exposed to Japan, and we’re part of that,” said an Aflac spokeswoman, Laura Kane. She said the company was not expecting a flood of claims and had not changed its financial projections because of the trouble in Japan. Shares of Hartford Financial Services fell 4.55 percent on Tuesday. The shares of MetLife and Prudential Financial, which acquired Japanese life insurance when they bought subsidiaries of the American International Group, fell about 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Business insurers that operate globally, like ACE, Chartis, Allianz and Zurich, have a relatively small toehold in Japan, and therefore small exposure. About 90 percent of the property and casualty business in Japan is written by three big domestic insurance groups, the MS&amp;AD Insurance Group, the Tokio Marine Group and the NKSJ Group. The Japanese insurers jointly own a reinsurer, the Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Company, which in turn is backstopped by the Japanese government. “A meaningful portion of the losses will flow to the global reinsurance industry,” said Kenji Kawada, senior analyst for Moody’s Japan K.K. He cited Munich Re, Swiss Re, Scor, Hannover Re, Berkshire Hathaway, PartnerRe and Everest Re as the largest reinsurers and therefore the likeliest to suffer. Moody’s said ratings for all of the major reinsurers were stable, and many reinsurance analysts said they saw one bright spot in the disaster: prices for reinsurance have been declining for several years, and while the earthquake will hurt the results of companies for one quarter, it might spur new demand and higher prices. Reinsurance contracts are often renewed in April, and Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods issued a report on Tuesday suggesting that losses from the earthquakes in Japan and, recently, New Zealand would lead to firmer prices on California earthquake and Florida hurricane insurance. The big global reinsurers had packaged some Japanese earthquake risks into a type of security known as catastrophe bonds, or cat bonds. Cat bonds are sold to syndicates of institutional investors that expect a high return on the understanding that they will lose some or all of their principal if the covered disaster occurs. Cat bonds are set off only by events that are specified in great detail in advance. Moody’s said it had identified four rated bonds linked to some form of earthquake coverage in Japan. The initial estimate, by AIR Worldwide, of insured losses from the earthquake was very narrow. Issued on Sunday, that estimate, of $15 billion to $35 billion, included only damage caused by the earthquake and the subsequent fires, not the tsunami, landslides or nuclear accidents. An AIR Worldwide spokesman, Kevin Long, said on Tuesday that the company had already counted about $24 billion worth of insured commercial and residential properties within two miles of the coast in the affected areas. As the company works on financial models of all the disasters, the value of some of those properties will be added, he said. The company expects to revise its estimate early next week. The initial estimate included the cost of physical damage to houses and their contents, farms and commercial property, as well as insured business-interruption losses. The company’s estimates will never include a multitude of losses that are not insured: cars swept away, damaged property, buckled roads and weakened bridges, and something called “demand surge” — the spike in materials prices and labor costs that often comes with large-scale rebuilding after a catastrophe. The uninsured losses may turn out to be the greatest losses of all. Until now, the most destructive earthquake in terms of property damage was the one that struck Northridge, Calif., in January 1994, when insurers paid out $15.3 billion, or $22.5 billion in today’s dollars. Sixty-one people died. The quake with the biggest death toll struck just after Christmas in 2004 off the western coast of Indonesia, which also set off a gigantic wave. About 220,000 people died in that tsunami, by far the most since the Insurance Information Institute began tracking earthquake statistics in 1980. “What makes today’s natural disaster so extraordinary is that four of the five costliest earthquakes and tsunamis in the past 30 years have occurred within the past 13 months,” said Robert Hartwig, president of the institute, citing two big quakes in New Zealand and one in Chile along with the disaster in Japan.Apart from an expected $35 billion in insurance claims from last week’s earthquake, the financial losses in Japan will probably fall most heavily on the Japanese government once it tallies the damage from the tsunami and the nuclear disaster.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/a-i-g-fetches-9-6-billion-for-metlife-holdings/?ref=metlifeinc">A.I.G.

A.I.G. could reap more than $9 billion in proceeds from the stock sales, based on MetLife’s closing share price of $46.04. Its holdings in MetLife are composed of common and preferred stock that are equivalent to 146.8 million shares and equity units with a stated value of $3 billion. A.I.G. is itself preparing for an enormous offering of its own shares that would drastically cut the Treasury Department‘s 92.1 percent ownership stake in the insurer. That stock sale, called a re-I.P.O., is likely to come in May, people briefed on the matter previously told DealBook.

The specific mix of MetLife equities was chosen to cap A.I.G.’s ownership in a major rival. Under the terms of the deal worked out by A.I.G., MetLife and the Treasury Department, A.I.G. will sell the common shares and equity units. MetLife will buy back the preferred shares, drawing largely from the proceeds from a concurrent stock offering of 68.5 million shares. The discussions among the three parties came together over the past few weeks, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. All three agreed to expedite the timetable, which would help A.I.G. shed its ties to the government. MetLife would also benefit from removing an overhang of having so many shares — equivalent to about 14 percent of its outstanding stock — tied up by A.I.G. One reason driving the decision was the rise in MetLife’s share price, which is almost at its one-year high. “We appreciate MetLife’s agreement to permit the proposed sales,” Robert S. Miller, A.I.G.’s chairman, said in a statement. “As a result, A.I.G. expects to take another major step forward.” A.I.G. is expected to market its stock sales on Wednesday and Thursday, people briefed on the matter told DealBook.

The company’s auto premiums also declined. The catastrophe-related losses had been expected as a result of the high number of storms late in the year, but had not been taken into account in market forecasts. While MetLife and Prudential reported smaller profits than a year ago, both managed to beat expectations. MetLife had record variable annuity sales and a 23 percent rise in retirement product fees. MetLife posted a net profit of $51 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $289 million, or 35 cents a share. Operating earnings were $1.14 a share, better than the $1.10 expected by analysts. MetLife said net income fell in the quarter because of a number of factors, including hedging related to its variable annuity business and higher amortization of costs related to its acquisition of new business. Stock in MetLife, which is based in New York, fell 87 cents, to $47.60 a share. Prudential reported a net profit of $213 million, or 45 cents a share, against a year-earlier profit of $1.79 billion, or $3.78 per share. Adjusted operating earnings were $1.78 a share. Analysts expected earnings of $1.48 a share for the period. Net profits sank on nearly $1 billion in realized losses and related adjustments, tied largely to the falling value of derivatives used in the company’s hedging programs. Prudential blamed fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies for the losses. Stock in Prudential, which is based in Newark, fell 88 cents, to $63.13 a share. Allstate had a net profit of $296 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $518 million, or 96 cents a share. Operating earnings of 50 cents fell short of the 88 cents expected by analysts. Allstate’s declines were tied mostly to the higher catastrophe losses and a rise in claims and claims expense, plus a jump in operating costs. Allstate’s chief executive, Thomas J. Wilson, said the company was still working to get the right pricing and customer mix in its homeowners’ operations. Stock in Allstate, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., fell 20 cents, to $32.36 a share. ”We still have a ways to go before we get a return on that business,” Mr. Wilson said in an interview, adding that he thought the goal was 12 to 18 months away.Major insurers posted mixed results on Wednesday as the Allstate Corporation fell short of estimates because of catastrophe-related losses, while the life insurers MetLife and Prudential Financial had stronger results, helped by returns on their annuity businesses.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/media/28adco.html?ref=metlifeinc">Companies Promote Health and Brands With Playgrounds<date>Published: December 27, 2010</date><text>MARKETERS like Kraft Foods, MetLife, CVS and Dr Pepper/Snapple Group are steering millions in charitable dollars to a new and somewhat unlikely project — building neighborhood playgrounds for children.The companies are embracing the playground as an opportunity to make their names better known — and better liked — locally and to encourage employees to volunteer in their communities. As the first lady, Michelle Obama, highlights child obesity and urges regular exercise, providing play spaces is a winning cause for the food and beverage companies, which are under fire for high calorie snacks and drinks. Dr Pepper/Snapple Group pledged $15 million this month to build or fix 2,000 playgrounds over the next three years. “A fit and active lifestyle is one of our philanthropic goals,” said Tina Barry, senior vice president for corporate affairs at the company’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. “Playgrounds align with that.” In October, Kraft Foods made playground-building a centerpiece of its annual company “Delicious Difference Week.” About 1,300 employees, including the chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, built 13 playgrounds, including one in Washington Park on the South Side of Chicago, at a total cost of more than $1.4 million. Kraft, too, counts healthful lifestyles, along with ending hunger, as a top philanthropic priority. “It’s huge — getting children excited about play,” said Nicole Robinson, the vice president of the company’s charitable arm, the Kraft Foods Foundation. Kraft and other companies that provide money for playground construction say they have not studied whether their contributions increase public awareness of their brand. Corporate-financed playgrounds typically bear a plaque with the company’s name and receive a flurry of local news coverage. Kraft’s playground projects are “a huge boost to the company’s reputation, and add to its credibility,” Ms. Robinson says. • Foresters, the life insurance provider, also has opted for playgrounds, recently pledging $1.5 million to build 20 in the United States, where the company, which is based in Canada, has most of its clients. “It’s a good fit for us,” said George Mohacsi, its president and chief executive. “And we get more bang for the buck when we build a playground, we put in something that people can use daily for a decade or more.” A. Dennis White, president and chief executive of MetLife Foundation, said his company regularly finances playgrounds to promote physical fitness. The company has donated $850,000 in the last three years for 400 play spaces in the United States and Mexico. “It’s something that can be built in a day, and we like the visibility it gets in the local community,” Mr. White said. Once upon a time, playgrounds were largely the province of schools or municipalities, but with plummeting local tax revenues, they are ripe for corporate support. This dovetails with a recent study that found companies are allocating their charitable giving — whether it is goods, services or cash — more toward community needs instead of grand goals such as alleviating world hunger. Basic needs were the only categories in which corporate cash contributions increased last year, according to the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy’s annual corporate giving report, which used information from 171 major companies, including 61 of the Fortune 100. Companies financing playgrounds often work in partnership with Kaboom, a nonprofit group based in Washington, which recently drew praise from Mrs. Obama. It has a comprehensive plan to include the community and company volunteers in designing, building and maintaining play spaces. Kaboom has nearly 300 corporate partners, including Home Depot and Kimberly Clark. Darell Hammond, its chief executive, said companies need to spend $75,000 to $500,000 to create a public playground, depending on whether the floor is rubberized. Companies are drawn to the idea because “playgrounds bring the community together,” Mr. Hammond said. “It’s almost a new town square.” Other companies work with nonprofit organizations like Shane’s Inspiration or Boundless Playgrounds, to create play areas that are accessible to disabled children. This fall, CVS worked with the Pepsi Refresh Project to give $70,000 to construct the playground proposal from the public that had won the most votes on the project’s Web site. A Fort Wayne, Ind., playground proposal was selected and will be built in 2011, said Eileen Howard Dunn, senior vice president for community relations for CVS Caremark. CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., has spent $3 million in recent years to finance 65 playgrounds around the country, and has pledged to build 10 more next year as part of its $25 million “All Kids Can” initiative to help disabled children. With charitable cash in shorter supply, companies are encouraging employees to volunteer. The corporate philanthropy committee report found that in the last three years, 20 percent more companies offer paid time during the workday for employees to volunteer. • Companies devoting resources to building playgrounds, which typically are in areas that are home to a concentration of their employees, say that worker engagement and satisfaction are important considerations in choosing the playground option. “Employees who participate feel a sense of community whether they participate for the one day or for the six months of planning,” Ms. Robinson, of Kraft, said. “And any company really receives a halo.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/nyregion/22stuyvesant.html?ref=metlifeinc">Lee Lorch Recalls Fighting All-White Stuyvesant Town<date>Published: November 21, 2010</date><text>Lee Lorch follows the financial travails of Stuyvesant Town from his apartment on the brick-lined streets of Toronto’s distillery district.And though he did not attend a recent meeting of 1,200 tenants, such a session was a familiar occasion for Dr. Lorch, who was instrumental in another tenant-led effort, 60 years ago, to desegregate Stuyvesant Town, the vast apartment complex on the East Side of Manhattan that was recently taken over by its lenders. He was a leader among the tenants who petitioned and picketed, but ultimately lost a bruising legal battle in 1949, in which the state’s highest court ruled that a private landlord could reject tenants based on race. Dr. Lorch, a mathematician who, at 95, is still writing for scholarly journals, lost a succession of teaching positions for his trouble and ultimately left New York and the country to find work. Yet the movement did eventually force the owner of Stuyvesant Town, Metropolitan Life Insurance, to scrap what was called the No Negroes Allowed policy. The battle also inspired the open-housing movement that eventually made housing discrimination illegal nationwide. “It was a landmark in the struggle against segregation in this country,” Dr. Lorch said. “I thought then, and still do, that it was an important struggle worth any sacrifice in pursuing it. I have no regret over what we did, or what it cost us, although I much preferred living in my hometown.” History had almost forgotten the fight. But Dr. Lorch was filmed recently by members of the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Oral History Project, which is documenting the lives of residents of the complex, where a newfangled public-private partnership was forged in the 1940s to build housing that would anchor the middle class to the city’s interior. With the city facing a housing crisis in 1943, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia announced that Metropolitan Life would redevelop a 72-acre tract, demolishing the crumbling 18-block gashouse district to erect 12- and 13-story buildings with 8,759 apartments surrounded by playgrounds and lawns. The announcement prompted some opposition from businesses and the 11,000 residents who would be relocated. But the biggest uproar came after the president of Metropolitan Life, Frederick H. Ecker, told The New York Post that no blacks would be permitted to live there. “Negroes and whites don’t mix,” Mr. Ecker said. “If we brought them into this development, it would be to the detriment of the city, too, because it would depress all the surrounding property.” Elected officials, labor organizations, civil rights groups and Jewish organizations condemned the policy, but the project quickly gained city approval. And by the time Stuyvesant Town opened in 1947, 200,000 people, many of them veterans, like Dr. Lorch, had applied for apartments. Dr. Lorch was living in “half a Quonset hut” overlooking Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn, with his wife, Grace, and daughter, while commuting to City College, where he was a math instructor. Dr. Lorch said it was fairly well known that Stuyvesant Town “was going to be an all-white project.” But, he added, the demand for housing was so acute that “there was no way of boycotting Metropolitan.” “But going there carried an obligation to fight discrimination,” he added. “That’s the way a lot of people felt.” In 1948, a dozen tenants at Stuyvesant, including Dr. Lorch, formed the Town and Village Tenants Committee to End Discrimination in Stuyvesant Town. The activists surveyed the views of the complex’s 25,000 residents. “It turned out that two-thirds were against MetLife’s exclusionary policy,” Dr. Lorch said. After the courts ruled in favor of MetLife, the tenants adopted a new tactic. In August 1949, Jesse Kessler, a labor organizer, offered his apartment temporarily to Hardine Hendrix, a black fellow union member, and his family. They had been living in a cramped, rat-infested apartment in Harlem. The Hendrixes’ appearance at Stuyvesant Town caused a sensation, but the insurer was loath to risk a confrontation, with committee members and union activists often sleeping at the apartment to ensure that the family would not be evicted without a fight. And when Mr. Kessler returned from vacation, Dr. Lorch offered the Hendrixes his apartment on 14th Street. He was leaving for Penn State, having lost his job at City College when the administration overruled his colleagues and declined to grant him tenure. The decision was believed to be connected to his activism at Stuyvesant Town. But Dr. Lorch lasted only a year at Penn State, which also did not reappoint him, despite a recommendation by the department chairman. Dr. Lorch said at the time that a college official had told him that his decision to permit a black family to live in his New York apartment was “extreme, illegal and immoral and damaging to the public relations of the college.” One thousand students signed a petition saying that his dismissal was “unacceptable.” A fellow mathematician, Albert Einstein, also weighed in on his behalf. Dr. Lorch and his family returned to New York, where MetLife had succumbed to pressure and agreed to admit three black families in 1950. At the same time, MetLife moved to evict Mr. Kessler, Dr. Lorch and 33 other tenant leaders and their families. Early in 1952, a city marshal ordered the activist tenants out of their apartments. Hundreds of tenants raced to picket City Hall and MetLife’s headquarters. Fearing negative publicity, MetLife eventually agreed to drop the eviction proceedings and accept the Hendrixes, while Dr. Lorch and several others voluntarily agreed to move out. By then, Dr. Lorch was teaching at Fisk University, a historically black institution in Nashville. But because of his civil rights activity and his refusal to answer questions when called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he said, he lost the position and, later, one at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Ark. Dr. Lorch moved to Canada, working first at the University of Alberta and later at York University in Toronto. Still, he does not regret the decision he made at Stuyvesant Town six decades ago. “I would have paid a higher price living with my conscience if I hadn’t done it,” he said.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/the-trouble-with-long-term-care-insurance/?ref=metlifeinc">The Trouble With Long-Term Care Insurance<date>November 12, 2010, 9:40 pm</date><text>In this weekend’s Your Money column, I address in more detail a theme that I first touched on in our special section on the sandwich generation: Should we really have faith that long-term care insurance is a product that will work over the long haul?

Now a third complex built by Metropolitan Life in the 1940s for veterans and middle-class families has run into financial distress after being purchased by speculators during the recent real estate boom. The owners of the sprawling Parkmerced apartment complex in San Francisco announced this week that they would default on their $550 million mortgage, which comes due in October. A partnership of Laurence Gluck of Stellar Management and the Rockpoint Group, which had already lost Riverton Houses in Harlem in March to foreclosure, put out a statement on Wednesday that placed their problems at the 3,221-unit Parkmerced in the context of the current economic downturn. “The landscape has changed dramatically,” P. J. Johnston, a spokesman for the owners, said in an interview. “The economy has taken a major hit. Many properties are facing default.” But just like Riverton and Stuyvesant Town, the owners of Parkmerced sought to take advantage of a roaring market to replace rent-regulated residents with tenants able to pay far higher rates. The owners in all three cases invested substantial sums in upgrading the aging buildings and renovating some apartments. But ultimately they failed to increase revenue enough to cover the debt payments on the properties, which were heavily leveraged. The recession did not help. “It’s pretty interesting that they have all ended up in the same place,” said Andrew Florio, an analyst at Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. “People assumed they could boost revenues by kicking people out and raising rents.” Stellar told the more than 6,000 tenants at Parkmerced, which is spread over 115 acres on the south side of San Francisco, that life would go on as usual. They said they were negotiating with lenders, which include Deutsche Bank, to restructure their debt and would continue with their $1.2 billion expansion proposal to nearly triple the number of apartments at Parkmerced. “Phone calls will be answered and issues addressed, our maintenance team will respond to work orders, and the leasing team will continue to lease new apartments,” Seth Mallen, an executive vice president for Stellar, said in a statement. But so far, lenders have been reluctant to acknowledge the losses and restructure deals that were struck during the boom. And analysts say it remains difficult for owners to refinance large properties at anywhere near the old terms. As Stellar points out, they are not alone; more than $150 billion in commercial loans like theirs have been transferred to special servicers who handle troubled debts. There is $550 million in senior debt on Parkmerced and an additional $52 million in secondary loans, according to the owners, but it is not as heavily leveraged as Riverton or Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The default was bad news for the giant California public employees pension fund, Calpers, which invested in all three properties. Calpers has already written off a $500 million investment in Stuyvesant Town. Stellar and Rockpoint were forced to give up Riverton Houses after defaulting on $250 million in loans. And Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper, which had been bought by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty for $5.4 billion in 2006, is in foreclosure. All three deals had prompted an outcry from tenant advocates who bemoaned the loss of housing affordable to working and middle-class families. “The Bay Area, like New York City, continues to be one of the least affordable real estate markets in the country,” said Christopher Lund, a spokesman for the East Palo Alto Fair Rent Coalition. “The Parkmerced is the largest multifamily complex in San Francisco and its 3,200 rent-stabilized units are a key part of the Bay Area’s remaining affordable housing stock.” MetLife built Parkmerced, Stuyvesant Town, Riverton and a handful of other large complexes in the 1940s amid a national housing crisis in a remarkable effort to provide homes for returning veterans. At Stuyvesant Town, for instance, the company received special property tax exemptions in return for agreeing to build the complex, maintaining relatively low rents and limiting its annual profit to 6 percent. At the start of the real estate boom in 2004, private equity firms began buying these kind of meat-and-potato complexes, which they had long eschewed in favor of luxury buildings. In 2005, Mr. Gluck and Rockpoint bought Riverton, a middle-class complex where more than 90 percent of the 1,200 apartments were rent-regulated. A year later, Mr. Gluck refinanced his debt with $250 million in loans, allowing him to modernize the lobbies, install new elevators and glass doors, landscape the center courtyard and pocket tens of millions in profit. Rents covered less than a third of the monthly debt payments. Mr. Gluck had estimated he could raise income substantially by converting half the apartments to market rates by December 2011. But by the time he neared default in August 2008, he had converted only 128. The lenders took back the complex at a foreclosure sale earlier this year.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/primerica-climbs-in-first-day-of-trading/?ref=metlifeinc">Primerica Climbs in First Day of Trading<date>April 1, 2010, 2:21 pm</date><text>Shares of Primerica, which Citigroup spun off, leaped as much as 30 percent above their initial public offering price on Thursday, on optimism that the life insurer is poised to benefit from a rebounding economy, Reuters reports. The shares opened at $19.15 and rose as high as $19.94 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. The strong market debut followed a strong pricing on Wednesday that led underwriters to raise the size of the offering by 19 percent, to 21.36 million shares. The shares were priced at $15 each, above the expected range of $12 to $14. More from Reuters: But Primerica’s I.P.O. still sold at a price-to-book value discount to Ameriprise Financial, MetLife and Prudential Financial, which it identified in its prospectus as competitors, said IPOdesktop.com President Francis Gaskins. The relatively low valuation, plus signs of confidence in a gradually rebounding economy, both contributed to the share’s gains, analysts said. “Life insurance has been hammered by the recession like everything else has, but there has been an uptick over the past year in applications for issuance of traditional bread-and-butter life insurance,” said Clark Troy, a senior analyst at Aite Group LLC. “Insurers have been looking to bulk up their sales forces, and Primerica has one.” Citi, which accepted $45 billion worth of government bailout funds, is seeking to divest assets that are not part of its core banking business.

The $15.5 billion purchase of the American Life Insurance Company includes billions of dollars worth of eclectic assets, ranging from Greek bonds to Japanese commercial real estate. While MetLife argues that its credit rating will remain strong, the deal doesn’t give it much wiggle room, given its own $50 billion exposure to commercial real estate. Alico appears to have been a bit more aggressive than MetLife when it came to investing its policy holders’ premiums. The business has about $81 billion of assets in its general account, with roughly 50 percent in corporate bonds, 30 percent in government bonds, 9 percent in mortgage-backed securities and 11 percent in cash and other investments. More than half of the $40 billion in Alico’s corporate bonds — $23 billion — is invested in financial companies. MetLife said that the bonds were highly rated and had minimal hybrid exposure, but the investment risk remains concentrated in one volatile sector. Alico also owns Greek bonds with a face value of $1.3 billion. MetLife will need to take a $200 million write-down of those holdings and may need to further adjust those marks in the future, the company’s chief financial officer, Bill Wheeler, told analysts on a conference call on Monday. Alico also owns $2 billion worth of Polish government bonds, in another indication of its sovereign debt risk. The A.I.G. unit also has considerable exposure to real estate, with $5.3 billion worth of commercial mortgage-backed securities, 93 percent of which are tied to the American property market. Alico also invested in the lower tranches of some commercial mortgage-backed securities deals, with about $2 billion of the $7 billion in its structured investment portfolio carrying a credit rating below AA. Then there’s Alico’s $1 billion exposure to Japanese commercial real estate. MetLife said that it had reached a loss-sharing agreement with A.I.G., wherein MetLife would absorb the first $100 million in losses from the portfolio, with further losses to be shared equally by both companies. The pact will be in place for the next five years. – Cyrus Sanati Go to MetLife Conference Call Web Cast » Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/a-i-g-nears-resolution-of-tax-issue-in-deal-for-unit/?ref=metlifeinc">A.I.G. Nears Resolution of Tax Issue in Deal for Unit<date>March 4, 2010, 4:13 pm</date><text>4:43 p.m. | Updated The American International Group moved closer to the $15 billion sale of a second major life insurance unit on Thursday after the Internal Revenue Service indicated that it would rule favorably on a tax issue that had stymied the deal, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. With the resolution of the tax issue, A.I.G. will be able to wrap up the sale of the unit, the American Life Insurance Company, known as Alico, to MetLife within days, these people said. One of them said a deal could be reached by Sunday evening. If a deal is reached, it would represent yet another big repayment of the federal government’s bailout of A.I.G. at the height of the financial crisis. The first $9 billion of proceeds from the sale will go toward repaying the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which owns preferred shares in the unit. This week, A.I.G. sold its big Asian life insurance unit, American International Assurance, to Prudential for $35.5 billion. The New York Fed is set to receive about $16 billion from that sale. So far, the government has committed more than $180 billion to supporting A.I.G., by far the costliest bailout of any company rescued during the financial crisis. A.I.G. has committed to selling off nonessential businesses to help pay down that investment, reducing itself to a global property and casualty insurer and a domestic life insurer. A.I.G. and MetLife had been in negotiations for months over a deal for Alico, and the contours of a deal were set for some time: MetLife would pay about $7 billion in cash and $8 billion in stock. But the two companies hit an obstacle in the form of a 2004 I.R.S. ruling that Alico never put into effect. As previously reported, under that ruling, domestic insurance companies that sell annuities and life insurance policies to customers abroad must withhold income taxes from any payments to those customers. A.I.G. had contended that the ruling did not apply to Alico, which despite having Delaware as its domicile draws more than 80 percent of its revenue from abroad. MetLife had asked A.I.G. to provide compensation in case the I.R.S. did not agree with its contention, according to people briefed on the matter. A.I.G. had requested an affirmation from the I.R.S. that its interpretation was correct, which the tax agency has indicated it will do.

Closes In on Deal for A.I.G. Unit<date>February 27, 2010, 2:58 pm</date><text>Updated | Feb. 28, 5:15 p.m.Prudential P.L.C. is close to clinching a deal to acquire the American International Group’s Asian life insurance unit for about $35.5 billion, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Sunday. Read more here. Prudential P.L.C., the British financial services firm, is in talks with the American International Group over a potential deal for the American firm’s giant Asia life insurance operations that could be worth more than $30 billion, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Saturday. A deal for the division, American International Assurance, or A.I.A., could come as soon as the middle of this week, these people said, cautioning that talks are continuing and may not lead to a transaction. A.I.G. has been planning an initial public offering of the business in Hong Kong to help repay the more than $180 billion in government bailout money that the insurer has received. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which owns a stake in A.I.A., is set to receive about $16 billion from any sale or spinoff of the division. A.I.A. has long been considered one of A.I.G.’s crown jewels, with some 20 million policy holders throughout Asia. Analysts have said that the A.I.A. offering could value the business at more than $20 billion. If a deal is struck, it would be the largest in Prudential’s 162-year history, making the firm into the biggest player in Asian life insurance. (The firm is not related to Prudential Financial of the United States.) Prudential and other firms had expressed interest in acquiring the unit last year, only to be rebuffed because A.I.G. was seeking a higher price. Prudential’s interest in buying A.I.A. could prompt other insurance firms and deep-pocketed investors like sovereign wealth funds into making their own bids for the business, the people briefed on the matter said. Edward Brewster, a spokesman for Prudential, and Christina Pretto, a spokeswoman for A.I.G., declined to comment to DealBook on Saturday. News of the talks over A.I.A. were first reported by Sky News. A.I.G. is also in talks to sell another life insurance unit, the American Life Insurance Company, to MetLife for about $15 billion, according to people briefed on the matter. Talks between the two firms have been stymied over a tax issue that requires resolution from the Internal Revenue Service, these people said. – Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. de la Merced</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/business/11views.html?ref=metlifeinc">Another Wrinkle in the A.I.G.

That means part of the New York Fed’s Alico investment could be replaced with a stake in MetLife.

Companies that sell businesses do sometimes accept some of the buyer’s stock as part of the price paid. And A.I.G. needs to sell Alico to advance its plan to repay its bailout. But it’s not ideal at the best of times, and in this case it muddies the whole A.I.G. picture. If the New York Fed or A.I.G. end up with MetLife stock, it will probably not be allowed to sell it for months. So the Alico sale would, at least for part of its value, achieve the replacement of one illiquid equity stake only with another  in a company the government doesn’t need to own. Of course, MetLife’s stock could go up in value and bring more for taxpayers in the end. And the deal would still probably be a quicker exit for A.I.G. than trying to float Alico, which would initially raise only a small amount of cash. Another option might be to accept a slightly lower price if MetLife were able to sell more stock to public investors and pay A.I.G. entirely in cash. Whatever happens in the end, it’s a salutary example of the unforeseen wrinkles once governments start rescuing private companies. Capital Freeze Even before the nation’s capital was buried under three feet of snow, Washington was frozen solid as far as Wall Street has been concerned. Democratic bumbling and Republican obstructionism sapped legislative momentum from crucial reforms in finance. That gridlocked state of affairs is unlikely to change even after the snow melts and the federal government reopens offices. Even if Congress had some desire to make progress on those critical issues, Mother Nature would not have cooperated this week. A former mayor of the capital city was dead-on when he declared Washington was not a snow town. Commuter trains into the city aren’t running, the Metro subway system offers only limited service, airports are closed and Amtrak closed its rail link to Wall Street, the Acela Express. As a result, federal agencies and departments have been shut all week, running up a bill that is expected to be about half a billion dollars in lost productivity and opportunity costs, according to government estimates. Both the House and Senate have canceled all votes until after next week’s recess. Of course, it’s an ill snowstorm that doesn’t blow someone a bit of good. Toyota caught a break when a Congressional hearing to investigate its car recall was postponed for two weeks. And lawmakers skeptical of climate change guffawed when the Obama administration chose the middle of this Arctic blast as the best time to announce a new agency to study global warming. But the snow will eventually disappear, and there will be a general thawing. If only the same warming could be confidently predicted for relations between Democrats and Republicans in this heated election year. As long as both sides keep things icy inside Congress, it really won’t matter much what the weather outside is doing.

If the New York Fed or A.I.G. end up with MetLife stock, it will probably not be allowed to sell it for months. So the Alico sale would, at least for part of its value, achieve the replacement of one illiquid equity stake only with another  in a company the government doesn’t need to own. Of course, MetLife’s stock could go up in value and bring more for taxpayers in the end. And the deal would still probably be a quicker exit for A.I.G. than trying to float Alico, which would initially raise only a small amount of cash. Another option might be to accept a slightly lower price if MetLife were able to sell more stock to public investors and pay A.I.G. entirely in cash. Whatever happens in the end, it’s a salutary example of the unforeseen wrinkles once governments start rescuing private companies. Capital Freeze Even before the nation’s capital was buried under three feet of snow, Washington was frozen solid as far as Wall Street has been concerned. Democratic bumbling and Republican obstructionism sapped legislative momentum from crucial reforms in finance. That gridlocked state of affairs is unlikely to change even after the snow melts and the federal government reopens offices. Even if Congress had some desire to make progress on those critical issues, Mother Nature would not have cooperated this week. A former mayor of the capital city was dead-on when he declared Washington was not a snow town. Commuter trains into the city aren’t running, the Metro subway system offers only limited service, airports are closed and Amtrak closed its rail link to Wall Street, the Acela Express. As a result, federal agencies and departments have been shut all week, running up a bill that is expected to be about half a billion dollars in lost productivity and opportunity costs, according to government estimates. Both the House and Senate have canceled all votes until after next week’s recess. Of course, it’s an ill snowstorm that doesn’t blow someone a bit of good. Toyota caught a break when a Congressional hearing to investigate its car recall was postponed for two weeks. And lawmakers skeptical of climate change guffawed when the Obama administration chose the middle of this Arctic blast as the best time to announce a new agency to study global warming. But the snow will eventually disappear, and there will be a general thawing. If only the same warming could be confidently predicted for relations between Democrats and Republicans in this heated election year. As long as both sides keep things icy inside Congress, it really won’t matter much what the weather outside is doing.

The partnership that bought the 80-acre property on the East River announced on Monday that it was turning the keys over to its lenders after it defaulted on its loans and the value of the property fell below $2 billion. Yet in walking away, the partners, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, have left tenants in limbo and other investors with far bigger losses. Many of the other companies, banks, countries and pension funds  including the government of Singapore, the Church of England, the Manhattan real estate concern SL Green, and the Newcastle Investment Corporation  that invested billions of dollars in the 2006 deal stand to lose their entire stake. “At the time, it looked like a sound investment,” said Clark McKinley, a spokesman for Calpers, the giant California public employees’ pension fund, which bought a $500 million stake in the property. “When the market tanked, we got caught.” Calpers, he added, has written off its investment. So has Calstrs, a California pension fund that invested $100 million, as has a Florida pension fund that put $250 million into the deal. Even though nearly all of the attention and blame surrounding the default has been directed toward Tishman Speyer, it will lose only its original investment of $112 million. (BlackRock will also lose $112 million.) Any collateral damage to Tishman Speyer, which manages a $33.5 billion portfolio of 72 million square feet of property in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, was expected to be minimal; real estate experts said that Tishman’s reputation might suffer, but that the firm would still be able to put together deals and raise capital. “This is a big black eye for them,” said John McIlwain, a senior fellow for housing at the Urban Land Institute. “But it’s not the end of Tishman. They own a lot of property. It’s a dent, but not the end.” For decades, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village were an oasis for middle-class New Yorkers; they were built in the 1940s by Metropolitan Life, which received tax breaks and other incentives in exchange for keeping rents low, initially for the World War II veterans who were the first tenants. With rents and condominium prices skyrocketing in 2006, MetLife put developments on the auction block. A partnership formed by Tishman Speyer and BlackRock paid $5.4 billion. The acquisition cost was actually $6.3 billion, because the partnership had to raise $900 million for reserve funds to cover interest payments, apartment renovations and capital improvements. The rental income did not cover the monthly debt service. But the two partners were betting that they could turn a healthy profit over time as they replaced rent-regulated residents with tenants willing to pay higher market-rate rents. But their plan fell apart when they could not convert enough apartments to the higher rents as quickly as they had planned. And in the past two years, average rents in New York have fallen sharply, along with property values. Last year, analysts predicted that Tishman Speyer and BlackRock would default. That prediction intensified when New York State’s highest court ruled in the fall that the partnership had improperly deregulated and raised the rents on 4,400 apartments. The partners were forced to roll back rents and they have been in negotiations on rebates owed to tenants. (The eventual owners, not Tishman Speyer and BlackRock, are expected to inherit liability for the $215 million in rent rebates.) On Jan. 8, the owners defaulted on $4.4 billion in loans ($3 billion in senior mortgages and $1.4 billion in secondary loans). They had also raised $1.9 billion in equity. The problem was that the latest appraisal put the value of the complexes at about $1.9 billion. “It’s the poster child for the entire housing bubble,” said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital. “There’ll be some other spectacular blowups, but this will be at the top of the pecking order.” Mr. McIlwain said it may take a decade or more for the prices to reach the levels they did in 2006. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: January 27, 2010 An article on Tuesday about the fallout from the failed deal for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the two largest apartment complexes in Manhattan, misidentified one investor that stands to lose its entire stake.

Unit May Be Sold to MetLife<date>Published: January 19, 2010</date><text>MetLife, where Robert H. Benmosche made his mark as an insurance executive, has emerged as the lead bidder for a major subsidiary of the American International Group, where Mr. Benmosche is now chief executive. Skip to next paragraph Related Bernanke Wants an Audit of Feds Bailout of A.I.G. (January 20, 2010) Times Topics: American International Group Inc. | Credit Crisis — The Essentials Add to Portfolio American International Group MetLife, Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » The deal, if it goes through, would help pay off $9 billion of A.I.G.’s rescue debt to the government, and possibly more, depending on the price. Attempts to sell the unit, considered one of the insurer’s most valuable properties, have faltered for more than a year because of what A.I.G. called fire-sale bids during the financial crisis. Under the terms now being discussed, MetLife would pay about $14 billion to $15 billion for the A.I.G. subsidiary, which has an attractive foothold in fast-growing Asian markets, according to people briefed on the negotiations. That price suggests a handsome premium, although insurance company values can be difficult to judge, and prices have gyrated in the last two years. Separately, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board called on Tuesday for a federal audit of the central bank’s role in A.I.G.’s bailout, hoping to quell persistent questions and criticism. When he took over A.I.G. last August, Mr. Benmosche signed a commitment not to exert undue influence on transactions with his former company. At the time he joined A.I.G. he held 500,000 shares of MetLife stock, with options for 2.1 million more shares. His A.I.G. compensation package is intended to reward him if the company’s stock price rises consistently over a period of time. Its stock rose slightly on Tuesday, on word of the possible asset sale. An A.I.G. spokesman, Mark Herr, said the company would not comment on the talks. A MetLife spokesman, John Calagna, said it was the company’s policy not to comment on what he called “rumors or speculation.” He added, however, “MetLife does not need to enter into any M.&amp; A. transaction to meet its business objectives, and, as we’ve previously stated, our philosophy regarding M.&amp; A. activity is that any deal MetLife pursues would be strategically important and financially attractive to our shareholders.” MetLife is one of just a small number of insurance companies with the resources for an acquisition of this scale. It took advantage of a special federal program to tap the capital markets in 2008, but did not borrow from the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, and said it passed the government’s “capital assessment exercise,” known as the stress test. A.I.G. has already arranged to give the Federal Reserve Bank of New York the first $9 billion it receives from any sale of the subsidiary, the American Life Insurance Company, known as Alico. Those funds are to redeem $9 billion worth of preferred stock now held in a special-purpose vehicle for the New York Fed. Any additional proceeds from the sale of Alico would go toward paying down part of a separate, $35 billion credit facility from the New York Fed  the remains of its original bailout loan to A.I.G. in September 2008. The New York Fed would still have exposure to A.I.G. through two funds, Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III, which it created to help the insurer unwind about $50 billion worth of soured investments. And it has been promised the first $16 billion from the sale of another of A.I.G.’s big Asian life insurance companies, called A.I.A., on the Hong Kong stock exchange later this year. Even now, any deal between A.I.G. and MetLife is probably at least two to three weeks away, and could still fall through, according to the people briefed on the negotiations. MetLife has made offers for Alico before and been rebuffed. People who follow the insurance industry said that on the basis of numbers alone, MetLife’s offer was strong. American life insurance companies typically change hands at about 1.4 times their book value, according to Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former investment banker who specialized in insurance companies. Alico’s book value at the end of 2008 was a little less than $4 billion, according to a regulatory filing with its home state, Delaware. That suggests a bidder might try to get away with offering just $5.6 billion. Mr. Elliott called the $14 billion to $15 billion range “a very high multiple.” “But these are international operations, and they have footholds in potentially some quite fast-growing parts of the world,” he said. “The emerging markets, like China and India, are seen as potentially huge, profitable markets.” Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

Under the terms currently being discussed, MetLife would pay about $14 billion to $15 billion for the unit, these people said. A.I.G. has said that in a disposition of Alico, about $9 billion of the proceeds would go toward repaying the government’s lifeline. A deal for Alico is still two to three weeks away, these people said, cautioning that negotiations were continuing and might still fall apart. MetLife and A.I.G. held talks before about a potential sale of the unit; those talks fall apart over price. A spokesman for A.I.G. declined to comment. A spokesman for MetLife said in a statement: “Any deal MetLife pursues would be strategically important and financially attractive to our shareholders.” Since A.I.G. was bailed out during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, the company has been under pressure to pay back its government lifeline. But under its current chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche — a former head of MetLife — the insurer has said that it would not resort to a firesale of its businesses, instead seeking to sell them or stage initial public offerings at the highest possible price. A.I.G. is in the process of setting up an offering in Hong Kong for its big Asian life insurer, the American International Assurance Company, or A.I.A. Both Alico and A.I.A. were moved into special-purpose entities as part of a move to reduce the amount of debt A.I.G. owed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Under that arrangement, the New York Fed agreed to swap about $25 billion of its loans to A.I.G. in exchange for a stake in the two insurers. As part of that agreement, the Fed will reap about $9 billion from an Alico sale or offering and about $16 billion from the A.I.A. offering. – Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. de la Merced</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/business/17jenkins.html?ref=metlifeinc">George P.

Taps Former Chief of MetLife<date>Published: August 3, 2009</date><text>The American International Group has found another executive willing to come out of retirement to take on the thankless task of leading a troubled insurer that was brought to the brink of financial collapse before being rescued through multibillion-dollar bailouts from the government. Skip to next paragraph Business Wire Robert H. Benmosche, new head of the insurer A.I.G. Add to Portfolio American International Group MetLife, Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » A.I.G.’s board on Monday named Robert H. Benmosche, a former head of MetLife, to be chief executive of the company. He will take over from Edward M. Liddy, who was brought in by the government last year but has faced the task of defending a company that became a political symbol of excess on Wall Street. Mr. Liddy is stepping down after 10 grueling months with a salary of $1 a year. Mr. Benmosche’s pay package was not released but the company will have to disclose his employment contract in a regulatory filing. Mr. Liddy took on the job of chairman and chief executive of A.I.G. as a form of public service, but was castigated by members of Congress who seemed unable to separate him from the financial turmoil that he was trying to address. Even he said that the job was too big and complex as currently designed. In March, for instance, A.I.G. was criticized for paying retention bonuses to people in its financial products unit, the division that sold the credit-default swaps that nearly brought A.I.G. to financial ruin. The bonus contracts were arranged before Mr. Liddy took charge last September, but angry members of Congress attacked the payouts as a waste of taxpayer money. Several employees of the unit were named in news articles and hounded by the public and shunned by their neighbors. Afterward, the recipients of the bonuses complained that Mr. Liddy had not adequately come to their defense. Of the $165 million earmarked for these bonuses, some was returned by employees after the controversy. Government aid to the company has ballooned to $182 billion, which the company is seeking to pay down partly by shedding assets. The government now owns nearly 80 percent of A.I.G.

More Articles in Business »The American International Group has found another executive willing to come out of retirement to take on the thankless task of leading a troubled insurer that was brought to the brink of financial collapse before being rescued through multibillion-dollar bailouts from the government. Skip to next paragraph Business Wire Robert H. Benmosche, new head of the insurer A.I.G. Add to Portfolio American International Group MetLife, Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » A.I.G.’s board on Monday named Robert H. Benmosche, a former head of MetLife, to be chief executive of the company. He will take over from Edward M. Liddy, who was brought in by the government last year but has faced the task of defending a company that became a political symbol of excess on Wall Street. Mr. Liddy is stepping down after 10 grueling months with a salary of $1 a year. Mr. Benmosche’s pay package was not released but the company will have to disclose his employment contract in a regulatory filing. Mr. Liddy took on the job of chairman and chief executive of A.I.G. as a form of public service, but was castigated by members of Congress who seemed unable to separate him from the financial turmoil that he was trying to address. Even he said that the job was too big and complex as currently designed. In March, for instance, A.I.G. was criticized for paying retention bonuses to people in its financial products unit, the division that sold the credit-default swaps that nearly brought A.I.G. to financial ruin. The bonus contracts were arranged before Mr. Liddy took charge last September, but angry members of Congress attacked the payouts as a waste of taxpayer money. Several employees of the unit were named in news articles and hounded by the public and shunned by their neighbors. Afterward, the recipients of the bonuses complained that Mr. Liddy had not adequately come to their defense. Of the $165 million earmarked for these bonuses, some was returned by employees after the controversy. Government aid to the company has ballooned to $182 billion, which the company is seeking to pay down partly by shedding assets. The government now owns nearly 80 percent of A.I.G. Since then, A.I.G. has sought the guidance of the Obama administration’s pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg, on a variety of issues, including compensation for some of its top-ranked employees.

Both CIT  which hired the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom last week to advise it on its financing options  and GE Capital cling to business models that no longer work. Like banks, they make longer-term loans to customers. But they depend heavily on short-term financing through the capital markets to finance their assets. The market for such financing has essentially dried up. Lucky for GE Capital, it has a rich industrial parent, which has helpfully diverted a chunk of its dividend payments and capital to the financial business. CIT was spun off from a rival industrial conglomerate, Tyco, a few years back. And GE Capital has also availed itself mightily of the government’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. This has allowed GE Capital to issue a whopping $74 billion in bonds backed by Uncle Sam  making it the single biggest exploiter of the program, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Oddly, CIT’s application to take part in the guarantee program has been pending since January. Yet, CIT and GE Capital look like birds of a feather  arguably CIT looks like the prettier of the two ugly ducklings of finance. In the first quarter, CIT had shareholders’ equity equal to 10 percent of its $76 billion of assets  higher than GE Capital’s 9.6 percent. Moreover, CIT appears less dependent on short-term financing. GE Capital, which had $636 billion of assets, qualified $176 billion of liabilities, or 28 percent of its book, as short-term financing. CIT said $17 billion of its funds were due to be repaid within 12 months, equal to 22.5 percent of its total assets. CIT may yet gain access to Uncle Sam’s lending guarantee program before it has to pay back $1 billion next month, and manage through its short-term refinancing needs. But the smaller lender’s travails should make a compelling case for G.E. to begin winding down, and getting out, of the financial business for the longer-term good of its shareholders. MetLife Shopping Insurers have been battered by the financial crisis. That makes it a good time for MetLife to go shopping. The American International Group’s sale of its international life insurance business, Alico, seems to be an ideal target. MetLife had $38 billion of cash and short-term investments in the first quarter. And cash continues to pour in as risk-averse customers flock to insurers with the strongest balance sheets  its annuity sales in the first quarter were $7.4 billion, more than double the amount in the same period last year. True, much of MetLife’s cash has to be set aside for paying claims. But MetLife estimates it has excess capital of around $5 billion. And garnering more shouldn’t be hard. Since mid-May, insurers have raised about $15 billion in capital, according to JPMorganChase. MetLife is spoiled for choice. Insurers traded at about 1.5 times book value, or assets minus liabilities, before the crisis. Now, they trade at book. While nobody should expect a return to the headier days of the past, valuing these businesses at replacement cost seems too conservative over the long run. Enter Alico. MetLife needs to expand internationally. Foreign operations currently represent just about 15 percent of earnings. Overseas margins are higher, and life insurance in countries like India and China  unlike that in the mature United States market  is growing quickly. The sticking point in previous talks to buy Alico was price. Alico earned $1.3 billion in 2008 before capital losses. A.I.G. reportedly demanded $20 billion. It’s understandable why MetLife scoffed. Put the earnings on a multiple of 10  which assumes earnings are stable  and add a 30 percent control premium, and $17 billion would seem a fairer value. But MetLife should be able to negotiate a lower price. Alico’s business has clearly been damaged. Widespread anxiety last year in Asia over A.I.G.’s weaknesses hurt business. And A.I.G. is under intense pressure to sell  while MetLife could always walk away. If MetLife wants Alico, it shouldn’t be a struggle to ensure a deal gets done.

Add to Portfolio American International Group MetLife, Incorporated Axa S.A Go to your Portfolio » Grappling with huge losses, A.I.G. appears to have few choices as the government focuses on trying to keep the giant insurer from toppling and perhaps injuring other institutions. The insurer has received a preliminary offer of $11 billion from MetLife for its American Life Insurance Company subsidiary, called Alico, according to people with knowledge of the discussions, who asked not to be identified because the details of the deal were not public. But they said MetLife’s offer might slip to about $8 billion, as more became known about how the global downturn is affecting Alico, which has operations in more than 55 countries. The same sources said A.I.G. had received an offer from AXA, for all of Alico except its operations in Japan. The price was not disclosed. But A.I.G.’s need for capital appears to be growing so quickly that $8 billion, or even $11 billion, would not come close to filling the hole. A.I.G. is expected to report fourth-quarter losses of perhaps $60 billion early next week, and losses on that scale could initiate a domino effect like the one that flattened the company last September. First would come a credit downgrade, then calls from trading partners to post the billions of dollars in collateral that their contracts stipulate after a downgrade. If A.I.G. failed to produce the required amounts, the financial institutions holding its contracts would have to recognize losses of their own. That would erode their capital, leaving them at risk of downgrades as well. Facing a deadline at the end of this month, A.I.G. and the government are looking for a way to get more value from the insurance subsidiaries than they think could be captured in a sale to a competitor like MetLife or AXA. One person close to the discussions said it might resemble a private equity arrangement, in which the federal government would take ownership of A.I.G.’s operating units, then later sell them in an initial public offering. The goal of such a government purchase would be to inject capital into A.I.G. and to keep it from having to sell valuable assets when prices are depressed. But it would also put the federal government in the incongruous position of owning one or more insurance companies and competing with insurers in the private sector. “They wouldn’t like that, but they wouldn’t have a heck of a lot of choice,” said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It’s not like the government went out of its way to get these companies.” Edward Liddy, A.I.G.’s chief executive, has said since he was brought in during last fall’s crisis that he wanted to sell dozens of operating units to raise money to pay off the federal government’s loans. But the sales have come slowly. A.I.G. is so large there are few buyers to begin with, and financing for deals has been scarce in the credit squeeze. Shrewd buyers also appear to have been biding their time, expecting to get better deals as the pressure mounts on A.I.G. While they waited, the economy has soured and A.I.G.’s operating units have lost value. Its customers have been shifting their business elsewhere, and competitors have been poaching executives. “It looks like they’re in a downward spiral,” said Andrew J. Barile, an insurance industry consultant. “They’re in a position where they’re almost forced into selling.” Another possibility being discussed for A.I.G. is the conversion of the government’s holdings of A.I.G.’s preferred stock, worth $40 billion, into common shares. That would provide some relief because the preferred stock gets a 10 percent dividend, and the company would not pay any dividend on the common stock. Christina Pretto, an A.I.G. spokeswoman, said the company could not provide information about its finances or possible deals in the quiet period just before its earnings were released. An AXA spokesman said the company would not comment on reports of an offer for Alico. A MetLife spokesman did not respond to a call seeking comment. MetLife, the largest American life insurer, raised $2 billion in a stock sale last October, when its capital position was relatively strong. Market watchers took it as a sign that MetLife was getting ready to move as other companies’ share prices fell and acquisition possibilities emerged. Alico could serve as a springboard into dozens of countries, including some that have big untapped consumer markets because insurance products are not yet in widespread use.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Feature Five Weeks of Financial Turmoil Related Times Topics: Credit Crisis - The Essentials Add to Portfolio American International Group Prudential Financial Incorporated MetLife, Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » Insurance stocks have plunged more than 30 percent in the last five days, with Prudential Financial the big loser on Thursday. Prudential’s stock fell $10.02, to $33.27 a share, and it is now 42 percent lower than a week ago. A United States senator’s offhand remark hurt the group last week, but the group is continuing to suffer far more than the broader market. Investors are worried about falling earnings and the prospect that many in the sector may need additional capital, which would dilute their own shares. Hartford Financial Services Group raised $2.5 billion by selling shares to Allianz, the German insurer, on Monday. The Hartford’s shares closed at $20.11 Thursday, down $4.75. MetLife, the largest American life insurer, which warned earnings would be sharply lower in the third quarter, raised $2 billion in a stock sale on Wednesday. Even though existing shareholders were left with a smaller stake in the company, investors seemed heartened that the company could get funds readily, making it one of the few winners on a day when all 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average fell. MetLife closed at $28 a share, up $1. When the government bailed out American International Group, there was little talk of a widespread downturn in the insurance industry. A.I.G. was seen as unique because it was a large issuer of a type of derivatives contracts that were far less prevalent at other insurers. Those derivatives brought A.I.G. to the precipice. But now a wave of losses is moving throughout the insurance industry, caused by the seize-up of the credit markets and declining investment values. “Insurance companies tend to focus on high-quality investments,” said Douglas L. Meyer, an insurance analyst at Fitch Ratings. When the declines were mainly in the lower-quality investments, he said, the industry was relatively sheltered from harm. Now, though, Mr. Meyer said, “the depths of the current credit crunch is starting to affect the high-grade securities, so that’s starting to affect the insurance companies more.” For now, analysts do not see insurers in precarious situations. But if the investment losses keep mounting, they will start eating away at insurers’ capital. Even insurers with conservative investment portfolios, like MetLife, are not immune. The investment losses will also pose a problem for insurers with big retirement divisions, especially life insurance companies. They deal in investment products that guarantee a certain rate of return. Now the insurers will have to make those payments out of their diminished assets. Insurers whose business models involve large amounts of short-term paper, or other obligations that are maturing soon, also risk being caught short if the credit markets stay frozen. If they have to start selling securities to produce the cash to pay their obligations, they could end up dumping the instruments in a market that has many sellers and almost no buyers. “If the distressed market conditions persist, this will negatively impact insurance company liquidity,” Mr. Meyer said. Fitch lowered its outlook for the life insurance sector to negative from stable at the end of September. It said it thought some insurers had delayed recognizing unrealized investment losses this year, in hopes their impaired assets would regain value. But that has not happened, so the industry is likely to write down more impaired assets in the coming months. Weaker institutions may have trouble raising new money if their capital is eroded, and the government may be unwilling to come to the aid of more insurers after rescuing A.I.G. That suggests a consolidation and reshaping of the industry is in store. Though MetLife was one of the first big insurers to raise capital in this downturn, it appears to be one of the least in need. Even before it sold 75 million shares for $26.50 a share Wednesday, it had some $4 billion more than the level associated with a strong capital base. John Hall, a securities analyst at Wachovia, said in a report issued Thursday that he saw MetLife’s stock sale “as a pre-emptive maneuver to facilitate the company’s ability to take advantage of emerging strategic opportunities, including the possible acquisition of A.I.G. units.” A.I.G. has announced it is selling a large number of its insurance subsidiaries to raise money to pay off its $85 billion bridge loan from the Federal Reserve. MetLife, meanwhile, has expressed an interest in expanding its foreign operations. As of Thursday, Hartford Financial Services had been among the most punished by investors. Its stock has lost more than half its market value this month, prompting the Connecticut insurance commissioner, Thomas R. Sullivan, to issue a statement on Thursday that the Hartford’s “financial strength remains solid.” Hartford’s slide began in earnest after a comment by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, during the debate over the $700 billion Treasury bailout program. Mr Reid said in a television interview that he had heard that a major insurer, “one with a name that everyone knows,” was on the verge of going bankrupt. He later said he misspoke. Property and casualty insurers tend to be somewhat less vulnerable to investment fluctuations than life insurers, but they are also showing signs of strain. Even the A shares of Warren E. Buffett’s well-known holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, have lost market value, closing Thursday at $114,000, down $4,000 a share, and off 17 percent in the last five days. Mr. Buffett is nevertheless making big investments in municipal bond insurance and in companies like Goldman Sachs and General Electric. But most insurers are under siege. Prudential Financial issued a statement Thursday saying the operating income from its financial services businesses would be no more than $375 million in the third quarter, compared with $907 million in the third quarter last year. Along with other investment losses, Prudential will write down investments on securities in Lehman Brothers, A.I.G. and Washington Mutual. Prudential, which will issue its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29, also said it was suspending a stock buyback program to conserve capital.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Feature Five Weeks of Financial Turmoil Related Times Topics: Credit Crisis - The Essentials Add to Portfolio American International Group Prudential Financial Incorporated MetLife, Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » Insurance stocks have plunged more than 30 percent in the last five days, with Prudential Financial the big loser on Thursday. Prudential’s stock fell $10.02, to $33.27 a share, and it is now 42 percent lower than a week ago. A United States senator’s offhand remark hurt the group last week, but the group is continuing to suffer far more than the broader market. Investors are worried about falling earnings and the prospect that many in the sector may need additional capital, which would dilute their own shares. Hartford Financial Services Group raised $2.5 billion by selling shares to Allianz, the German insurer, on Monday. The Hartford’s shares closed at $20.11 Thursday, down $4.75. MetLife, the largest American life insurer, which warned earnings would be sharply lower in the third quarter, raised $2 billion in a stock sale on Wednesday. Even though existing shareholders were left with a smaller stake in the company, investors seemed heartened that the company could get funds readily, making it one of the few winners on a day when all 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average fell. MetLife closed at $28 a share, up $1. When the government bailed out American International Group, there was little talk of a widespread downturn in the insurance industry. A.I.G. was seen as unique because it was a large issuer of a type of derivatives contracts that were far less prevalent at other insurers. Those derivatives brought A.I.G. to the precipice. But now a wave of losses is moving throughout the insurance industry, caused by the seize-up of the credit markets and declining investment values. “Insurance companies tend to focus on high-quality investments,” said Douglas L. Meyer, an insurance analyst at Fitch Ratings. When the declines were mainly in the lower-quality investments, he said, the industry was relatively sheltered from harm. Now, though, Mr. Meyer said, “the depths of the current credit crunch is starting to affect the high-grade securities, so that’s starting to affect the insurance companies more.” For now, analysts do not see insurers in precarious situations. But if the investment losses keep mounting, they will start eating away at insurers’ capital. Even insurers with conservative investment portfolios, like MetLife, are not immune. The investment losses will also pose a problem for insurers with big retirement divisions, especially life insurance companies. They deal in investment products that guarantee a certain rate of return. Now the insurers will have to make those payments out of their diminished assets. Insurers whose business models involve large amounts of short-term paper, or other obligations that are maturing soon, also risk being caught short if the credit markets stay frozen. If they have to start selling securities to produce the cash to pay their obligations, they could end up dumping the instruments in a market that has many sellers and almost no buyers. “If the distressed market conditions persist, this will negatively impact insurance company liquidity,” Mr. Meyer said. Fitch lowered its outlook for the life insurance sector to negative from stable at the end of September. It said it thought some insurers had delayed recognizing unrealized investment losses this year, in hopes their impaired assets would regain value. But that has not happened, so the industry is likely to write down more impaired assets in the coming months. Weaker institutions may have trouble raising new money if their capital is eroded, and the government may be unwilling to come to the aid of more insurers after rescuing A.I.G. That suggests a consolidation and reshaping of the industry is in store. Though MetLife was one of the first big insurers to raise capital in this downturn, it appears to be one of the least in need.

The Fed threw A.I.G. the $85 billion lifeline shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when the financial markets were reeling and there were doubts the system could weather the demise of another big financial services company. At the time, the Fed’s loan was the most radical intervention ever by the central bank in a company’s affairs.

Goldman Sachs has said that it had no meaningful exposure to losses from A.I.G. A.I.G. said Wednesday that it would use the $37.8 billion from the Fed to improve the liquidity of its securities lending business, which is losing cash rapidly. By stopping that flow, A.I.G. said, it would be able to preserve more of the Fed loan and use that money more effectively to wind down the affairs of A.I.G.’s troubled structured finance division, known as the financial products unit. Under the latest agreement, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will accept up to $37.8 billion of fixed-income securities from A.I.G.’s regulated life insurance subsidiaries and will give the subsidiaries cash collateral in return. That will help the insurance subsidiaries to settle existing transactions in their securities lending business. In that business, the insurers lent securities to investors, like hedge funds, and received both the value of the securities and a fee in return. The insurers then invested those funds in other instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities. But now that the value of mortgage-backed securities has plummeted, A.I.G.’s insurance subsidiaries do not have the money to repay their securities-lending partners when they bring back the securities they borrowed and want their money back. By stepping in and permitting A.I.G. to lend the securities onward to the New York Fed, the Fed will allow A.I.G. to preserve cash. It will also keep A.I.G. from having to mark down the value of the securities at a time when their market value is constantly changing.

Skip to next paragraph Related Insurers Faulted as Overloading Social Security (April 1, 2008) Add to Portfolio Cigna Corp MetLife, Incorporated Aetna Incorporated Cigna Corp Unum Group Go to your Portfolio » Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, has sent letters to nine insurers, requesting detailed information about their handling of disability claims “as part of the committee’s ongoing inquiry into these important matters.” Sick and injured people must often wait more than a year before their claims can be decided by one of Social Security’s administrative law judges, a delay Mr. Grassley called “abominable.” “The last thing those who rely on Social Security need is for insurance companies to be clogging up the system by forcing ineligible applicants to apply,” he said. Mr. Grassley told the insurers to report on how many of their claimants they had compelled to apply for Social Security in the last five years; how many appeals they had required people to file; and what methods they had used to screen the people beforehand to make sure they truly had a chance of qualifying for the government benefits. The New York Times reported in April that disability insurers were making claimants apply for Social Security even when they did not qualify and were cutting off insurance checks if the claimants failed to do so. The Social Security Administration defines “disabled” much more narrowly than insurance policies typically do, so many people who qualify for insurance benefits do not qualify for Social Security. Lawsuits accuse two insurers, the Cigna Corporation and the Unum Group, of improperly pushing people into the Social Security system to avoid paying their claims. The lawsuits contend that forcing people to file meritless Social Security claims constitutes fraud under the False Claims Act. Kenneth D. Nibali, a former administrator of the disability program, has testified that such applications are expensive to process and contribute to a crushing backlog. The disability program is in much worse financial shape than the old age program. But Mr. Nibali said it was impossible to say how much of the disability program’s problems were being caused by insurance referrals. The Finance Committee is trying to answer that question. Insurance companies argue that requiring a Social Security assessment is a standard practice that helps their claimants by making sure they get the best coverage from all possible sources. A typical disability policy allows the insurer to coordinate its own benefit payments with those of others, like Social Security or workers’ compensation. Thus, if a disabled person turns out to qualify for any such benefits, the insurer can reduce its own benefit checks by that amount. But one recent case that went to the United States Supreme Court suggests that such coordination is haphazard. The case involved an Ohio heart patient whose insurer, MetLife, made her apply for Social Security. She was found to meet Social Security’s stricter criteria  but MetLife ignored the government’s finding, said she was not disabled and cut off her benefits. The court restored the woman’s coverage. The insurers appear to have an incentive to keep claimants’ appeals cycling through the Social Security system because the pending applications allow them to lower their claim reserves. In the insurance business, lower reserves mean higher profits. Senator Grassley asked the nine insurers to explain how their claimants’ Social Security applications affected their reserves and to “describe the timing and financial flows resulting from these adjustments.” In addition to Cigna, Unum and MetLife, information is being sought from Aetna, Hartford, Lincoln, Prudential, Standard and Reliance Standard.

Skip to next paragraph Related Justices, in Bias Case, Rule for Older Workers (June 20, 2008) Until now, employees who felt wrongly deprived of benefits could expect little help in court unless they could show that their plan administrators had behaved in an arbitrary, capricious or unprincipled way. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the majority, eased that requirement, but stopped well short of setting out specific new rules for when and how employees could challenge adverse benefits decisions. Employers said it was a ruling they could live with. “This is going to put the thumb on the scale in the employees’ favor,” said Lonie A. Hassel, a partner at the Groom Law Group in Washington who represents companies in employee benefits litigation. “But I think it’s only going to make a difference in close cases.” But others were deeply disappointed. “We had hoped the court would give greater clarity and guidance in these cases,” said John H. Langbein, a Yale law professor who is an authority on employee benefits law. “But they did not move the ball at all.” The Supreme Court issued its 6-to-3 ruling in favor of Wanda Glenn, an Ohio woman who worked for 14 years as a supervisor in the women’s department of a Sears store. She suffered from heart disease and took a leave of absence in 2000, providing extensive documentation from her doctor that she could not return to work. Sears offered employees long-term disability insurance as a benefit, but the plan administrator, MetLife, said Ms. Glenn did not qualify. She sued, and the trial court rejected her complaint because she had not shown that MetLife behaved arbitrarily. But the Appellate Court for the Sixth Circuit found in Ms. Glenn’s favor, saying that MetLife had acted under a conflict of interests. The Supreme Court’s affirmed that ruling, and Ms. Glenn will receive her benefits. The conflict the Supreme Court observed in MetLife’s role is one that employers, employees and insurance companies have been struggling with ever since Congress enacted a landmark employee benefits law in 1974. The law requires the officials who make decisions about employee benefits, known as plan administrators, to act solely in the interest of workers, yet they are usually hired by the company that pays for the benefits, and thus share the employer’s interest in keeping costs down. A 1989 Supreme Court decision acknowledged this potential conflict but stirred up confusion about how to address it. In the 1989 decision, the court decided that when district courts reviewed benefits disputes, they should review all the facts afresh, something called a de novo review. Employers feared this would undercut their plan administrators’ decisions and make the plans a legal battleground. But the opinion said that if companies explicitly gave discretionary authority to their plan administrators, then judges should generally defer to the plan administrator. Companies quickly began inserting clauses into their plans making the administrators’ decisions “final,” “conclusive,” and “binding.” But the 1989 decision also said that employees could sometimes win by showing that the plan administrator had acted under a conflict of interest. In his majority opinion, Justice Breyer wrote that it would be inappropriate for district courts to stop treating administrators with deference, or to give every dispute a full-blown de novo review. Instead, he called for something in between, requiring district judges to bear the administrator’s conflict in mind and factor it into their thinking. In a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia called the majority opinion “painfully opaque, despite its promise of elucidation.” More Articles in Business »Employees whose benefits claims are denied are entitled to a fuller day in court than they tend to get now, the United States Supreme Court decided Thursday, in a case that examined the conflicts of interest underlying most benefits decisions. Skip to next paragraph Related Justices, in Bias Case, Rule for Older Workers (June 20, 2008) Until now, employees who felt wrongly deprived of benefits could expect little help in court unless they could show that their plan administrators had behaved in an arbitrary, capricious or unprincipled way. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the majority, eased that requirement, but stopped well short of setting out specific new rules for when and how employees could challenge adverse benefits decisions. Employers said it was a ruling they could live with. “This is going to put the thumb on the scale in the employees’ favor,” said Lonie A. Hassel, a partner at the Groom Law Group in Washington who represents companies in employee benefits litigation. “But I think it’s only going to make a difference in close cases.” But others were deeply disappointed. “We had hoped the court would give greater clarity and guidance in these cases,” said John H. Langbein, a Yale law professor who is an authority on employee benefits law. “But they did not move the ball at all.” The Supreme Court issued its 6-to-3 ruling in favor of Wanda Glenn, an Ohio woman who worked for 14 years as a supervisor in the women’s department of a Sears store. She suffered from heart disease and took a leave of absence in 2000, providing extensive documentation from her doctor that she could not return to work. Sears offered employees long-term disability insurance as a benefit, but the plan administrator, MetLife, said Ms. Glenn did not qualify. She sued, and the trial court rejected her complaint because she had not shown that MetLife behaved arbitrarily. But the Appellate Court for the Sixth Circuit found in Ms. Glenn’s favor, saying that MetLife had acted under a conflict of interests. The Supreme Court’s affirmed that ruling, and Ms. Glenn will receive her benefits. The conflict the Supreme Court observed in MetLife’s role is one that employers, employees and insurance companies have been struggling with ever since Congress enacted a landmark employee benefits law in 1974. The law requires the officials who make decisions about employee benefits, known as plan administrators, to act solely in the interest of workers, yet they are usually hired by the company that pays for the benefits, and thus share the employer’s interest in keeping costs down. A 1989 Supreme Court decision acknowledged this potential conflict but stirred up confusion about how to address it. In the 1989 decision, the court decided that when district courts reviewed benefits disputes, they should review all the facts afresh, something called a de novo review. Employers feared this would undercut their plan administrators’ decisions and make the plans a legal battleground. But the opinion said that if companies explicitly gave discretionary authority to their plan administrators, then judges should generally defer to the plan administrator. Companies quickly began inserting clauses into their plans making the administrators’ decisions “final,” “conclusive,” and “binding.” But the 1989 decision also said that employees could sometimes win by showing that the plan administrator had acted under a conflict of interest.

The amount MetLife will pay for advertising was not announced, but a marketing expert said the deal could bring in $10 million to $15 million annually. The 82,500-seat stadium co-owned by the Giants and the Jets is scheduled to open in 2010. As a so-called cornerstone partner, MetLife will have the exclusive naming rights to one of the four main entrances to the stadium as well as one of the four scoreboards inside it. The stadium will be named after one of the five sponsors; their logos will appear both outside and inside the $1.3 billion stadium. Those naming rights could have an annual price tag of at least $20 million.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/nyregion/20plant.html?ref=metlifeinc">At a Pair of Gigantic Apartment Complexes, a Planting Project to Match<date>Published: April 20, 2008</date><text>Ten thousand more trees will soon be growing in Manhattan. Give or take one or two. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Earl Wilson/The New York Times New trees, shrubs and flowers are giving Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village an ambience that is almost suburban. Their roots will settle in the grounds of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling complexes that stretch for almost 10 blocks northeast of 14th Street near the East River, in one of the largest landscaping overhauls in Manhattan’s history. “When this project is complete,” said Erik Pauzé, the lead gardener, “we will have landscaped 60 of the 80 acres that make up these two properties.” The project was undertaken by Tishman Speyer, the developer that bought the two apartment complexes from MetLife in October 2006, for $5.4 billion. The work began this month and the target date for its completion is June 30, giving it an urgency that brings dozens of gardeners to the neighborhood. “On any given day, we might have 120 people here, gardening, installing flowers, trees and sprinkler systems,” Mr. Pauzé said. The daunting task involves 200,000 plants  including 10,000 trees, 3,123 shrubs and 120,906 perennials. It is 20 percent complete, with healthy dogwood and cherry trees already sprouting buds. Truckloads of canopy trees, perennials and shrubs will be delivered in the coming weeks. The project is the creation of Peter Walker and Partners, a landscape architecture firm based in Berkeley, Calif. “This is probably the largest planting project we have ever done,” Mr. Walker said. “Tishman Speyer already had quite a remarkable piece of real estate, but they brought us in to raise the bar by transforming the grounds and making the place look even more stunning.” Combined, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village comprise 110 buildings, each 13 or 14 stories, that stretch from 14th Street to 23rd Street, between First Avenue and Avenue C. On Thursday, Carole Jurman, 64, sat on a shade-covered bench in Stuyvesant Town and watched several gardeners go about the business of beautifying the place she has called home for the past 37 years. Since Tishman Speyer bought the properties, rent increases, Ms. Jurman said, have forced some of the 25,000 residents, including several of her longtime friends and neighbors, to pack up and leave. Ms. Jurman said that while she was “thrilled to see all the wonderful planting,” she was saddened that so many families had to move, and that they will not be around to smell the roses, not to mention the magnolias and skip laurels, when they bloom. “I feel bad for all of them,” said Ms. Jurman, who lives in a rent-stabilized apartment but would not reveal how much she paid. “There’s almost no place left for middle-class families to live in New York. It’s a terrible situation.” George R. Hatzmann, a managing director of Tishman Speyer who is overseeing the landscape project, said, “Rent increases are a part of life in the city, but we do our best to stay consistent with market prices.” Mr. Hatzmann said that 40,000 annuals and 100 hanging flower baskets would be in place by May 11, Mother’s Day. But he would not divulge the amount of money that Tishman Speyer is spending on the project. “It’s a significant price, but it’s well worth it because it enhances quality of life and makes this a better place to live,” he said during a walking tour on Thursday. “It’s a great way to enhance the look of the property for the people who live here, and for people who might live here in the future.” Dr. Bianca Alfonso, 35, who practices internal medicine at nearby Beth Israel Medical Center, moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Stuyvesant Town last year. She, too, declined to reveal how much rent she paid, but called her new neighborhood “the best-kept secret in New York.” “It’s really the best of both worlds,” said Dr. Alfonso, who is married with two small children. “Once you’re in here, surrounded by all of the parks and the beautiful landscaping, you feel as though you’re living in the suburbs. But when it’s time to go to work, you just step outside, and you’re back in busy downtown Manhattan.” Matthew Donham, an associate landscape architect, said that “one of the biggest challenges regarding this project is making sure that whatever we plant in large masses holds up against the scale of these buildings.” Mr. Donham stopped to point out a spot in Stuyvesant Town where double rows of oak trees would soon be planted. “Depth and contrast with different sized plants and an assortment of colors is what works best on the eye,” he said. He said that the enormousness of the project meant his company had to buy stock from nurseries across the country. The ginkgo and sweet gum trees, for example, came from Oregon. “We made a lot of nurseries very happy,” Mr. Donham said.

Marsh &amp; McLennan has been recovering from a sharp loss of income after its January 2005 settlement of the New York attorney generals investigation into bid-rigging, price-fixing and the use of contingent commissions, or incentive fees. The company agreed to pay $850 million to settle the New York case and related federal investigations and has since revamped its sales and marketing practices. Net income  excluding the Sedgwick Claims Management business, which was sold in early 2006, and other discontinued operations  was $223 million, or 39 cents a share, in the latest quarter. The results were stronger than the 36 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Revenue was $3.06 billion, up 9 percent from $2.81 billion a year earlier. That, too, was above the $2.93 billion expected by analysts, Thomson Financial said.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/nyregion/23stuy.html?ref=metlifeinc">Suit Challenges Rent Jumps in Complexes MetLife Sold<date>Published: January 23, 2007</date><text>The $5.4 billion sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village was hailed by Wall Street and the real estate industry as a bountiful coup for its owner, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. But yesterday a group of tenants at the vast brick complexes overlooking the East River charged in a lawsuit in State Supreme Court that MetLife had illegally charged market-rate rents for more than 3,000 apartments in the Manhattan complexes. The suit accuses the company of “wrongfully pocketing nearly $25 million in New York City tax benefits.” The tenants contend that MetLife received $24.5 million in tax breaks since 1992 under the city’s J-51 property tax program, which, they say, prohibits a property owner from removing apartments from rent regulation. The program, intended to encourage landlords to refurbish their properties and make capital improvements, gives tax breaks in return for pledges to keep rents relatively low. Most of the 11,200 apartments in the two complexes still have regulated rents, at one-third to one-half of market rate. The class-action lawsuit, which names both MetLife and the new owner, Tishman Speyer Properties, seeks to roll back rents at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. It also seeks a formal declaration that the other 3,000 apartments remain subject to rent regulation at least until the tax breaks expire, in 2017 or 2018. The suit also asks for $320 million in damages, or three times the rent overcharges for the past two years, as calculated by the plaintiffs. If it is successful, the legal action could cost MetLife about 6 percent of the sale price. It could also pose problems for Tishman Speyer and its partner, BlackRock Realty, which paid a record-breaking price for the complexes, based in part on the assumption that they could raise rents over time to market levels. It is unclear whether Tishman Speyer would reconsider the deal, but the lawsuit could hamper its financing efforts. “Even though this was the largest real estate transaction of all time, and MetLife certainly had a right to make as much profit as it could, the tenants who have rights under the law need to be protected,” said Stuart M. Saft, a lawyer for the tenants. A spokesman for Tishman Speyer, Steven R. Rubenstein, said, “We believe the suit to be without merit.” A spokesman for MetLife, John Calagna, declined to comment, saying the company had not seen the lawsuit. “It could have broad implications for market-rate tenants,” City Councilman Daniel Garodnick said of the lawsuit. “MetLife took advantage of certain tax benefits, which may have prevented them from deregulating apartments.” Mr. Garodnick, who lives in a market-rate apartment in Peter Cooper Village, had sought to organize a tenants’ bid on the complexes. A spokesman for the city’s housing commissioner, Shaun Donovan, declined to comment on the lawsuit. At the time of the sale last fall, both Tishman Speyer and MetLife dismissed the idea that J-51 tax benefits barred an owner from deregulating apartments. Now, Mr. Saft said, many market-rate tenants at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village have been “priced out” of their apartments. Tom Shamy, a jewelry designer and one of the tenants who brought the lawsuit, said that he and his wife had to move out of Stuyvesant Town on Dec. 31, after the new landlord raised the rent on their one-bedroom apartment by 28 percent, to $2,750 from $2,150. He said they were temporarily living with a friend in the East Village. “The whole New York rental market system is broken,” Mr. Shamy said. “There needs to be some changes in the law, or something. Anything I can do to call attention to the broken system, I’m willing to do.” Dan Irizarry, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Housing and Community Renewal, said that the Spitzer administration was reviewing the issues of J-51 tax abatements and affordable housing. This month, the new governor, Eliot Spitzer, rejected changes to the J-51 program that his predecessor, George E. Pataki, had proposed only days before leaving office. MetLife built Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in 1947 as housing for returning veterans, and it became known as an affordable option for middle-class people. The company received a 25-year exemption from property taxes in exchange for agreeing to maintain below-market rents. In 1974, the city extended the tax breaks for 10 years and the apartments became rent regulated. Under state laws passed in the 1990’s, an apartment can be decontrolled after it becomes vacant and is renovated, or if the rent reaches $2,000 a month and the existing tenants’ household income rises above $175,000 for two years. In the last four years, MetLife has done extensive renovations to vacant apartments, taking a total of 3,037 apartments out of rent regulation. Leonard Grunstein, a lawyer for the tenant association, which had tried to buy the complexes, learned that MetLife had obtained J-51 tax breaks and began researching the issue. The tenant association is not involved in the lawsuit, and Mr. Grunstein ultimately turned the case over to Mr. Saft. Mr. Saft said the law was fairly clear. A 1995 operational bulletin by the state’s housing agency states that “deregulation provisions” do not apply to apartments or buildings “which are subject to rent regulation by virtue of receiving tax benefits.” The lawsuit also cites the city’s regulations governing J-51 benefits, which state that apartments receiving the tax breaks “shall remain subject to rent regulation until the occurrence of the first vacancy” after the tax benefits expire.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Trophy Properties Lars Klove for The New York Times Rob Speyer, left, and Jerry I. Speyer of Tishman Speyer. Their purchase of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan for $5.4 billion is the largest real estate deal ever. On the phone was Darcy A. Stacom, the broker handling the multibillion-dollar sale of two huge, adjacent Manhattan tracts  Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village  for the properties owner, Metropolitan Life Insurance. Ms. Stacom asked Mr. Speyer to hustle eight blocks south from his Fifth Avenue conference room to a skyscraper on 45th Street, telling him to bring along representatives of his partner, BlackRock Inc., and his bankers and lawyers. She also cautioned him that they should arrive in groups of two, not en masse, to avoid any unwanted attention  there were eight other potential buyers waiting for the same phone call that Mr. Speyer had just received. Mr. Speyers team and MetLife then wrestled through the night over the terms of a possible sale, with an occasional round of five-card stud during the lulls. A bleary-eyed Mr. Speyer finally signed the documents at about 9:30 the next morning, plunking down a $400 million deposit on what would be the biggest real estate deal of all time: the $5.4 billion purchase of 80 acres of prime Manhattan land that included 110 buildings and 11,232 apartments. The price tag grabbed headlines around the world, generating commentary from the lobbies of Stuyvesant Towns red brick buildings to the newsrooms of National Public Radio to the set of Bill Maher on HBO. The initial bidding had attracted an international Whos Who in real estate and finance, ranging from the Rothschilds and the Safras to the Prince of Qatar and the investor Simon Glick, not to mention New Yorks leading real estate families, various publicly traded companies and a host of international banks. By the time it was over, the bidders had collectively amassed a staggering $35 billion for bidding rights in the deal. It was, as Daniel Garodnick, a New York city councilman who lives in Peter Cooper Village, put it, a defining moment in city history. International players who had single-mindedly pursued glamorous landmarks like the Chrysler and G.M. buildings in New York and the Sears Tower in Chicago were loudly proclaiming their appetites for humble, plain vanilla apartment buildings and a willingness to pay up  way up  to unlock future profits in the sprawling Manhattan properties. At the same time, the sale of what had traditionally served as an affordable, middle-class oasis for firefighters, civil servants and nurses hit a nerve in a city exhausted by skyrocketing real estate prices that had sent the cost of an average condominium well beyond $1 million. Tenants, housing advocates and much of the rest of the public feared that the new owners would remold the complexes in a way that would put them beyond the financial reach of many New Yorkers  a process already under way in most of Manhattan and a good portion of Brooklyn. But for deal makers counting trophies and lucre, the transaction was a coup. It was the fifth and biggest sale by MetLife of its real estate assets, raising its total proceeds to $9.5 billion since 2003. MetLife alienated some top politicians in New York with its decision to sell the Manhattan complexes, which were built with public subsidies, and its high-handed refusal to meet with local officials before the sale to discuss tenant concerns. But Wall Street was exultant about the sale; analysts upgraded the companys stock, predicting that MetLife would outperform other insurers. The deal was also a very public introduction for Rob Speyer, a thin, wiry-haired man with a secret passion for professional wrestling, who joined his fathers company a decade ago after stints as a reporter for two local newspapers. Mr. Speyer, who once handled dreary leasing assignments, was responsible for leading his team into the real estate record books. The previous record holder was his father, Jerry I.

Then they return home to a kitchen that is an accident waiting to happen. On the floor are loose runners  beautiful rugs, to be sure, but a fall hazard for people of any age and especially risky for those over 65. Skip to next paragraph Stuart Bradford They did place slip-resistant mats under the rugs, which helped some. But the rugs still move around and can easily cause someone to trip. And when someone their age trips and falls, chances are something will break. Falls are now the leading cause of injury-related deaths among people 65 and older, the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recently reported. The fatality rate from falls rose by more than 55 percent from 1993 to 2003, the latest year for which statistics are available. In fact, death rates from falls have risen faster than injury rates from falls, in part because people are now living to ages when frailty raises the risk that a fall will be fatal. But neither falls nor serious injury from them is an inevitable consequence of advanced age. Brian M. Franklin, a certified athletic trainer at University Orthopedics in Atlanta, and the MetLife Foundation, in collaboration with the Atlanta centers, offer excellent suggestions for tuning up your body and your environment to prevent falls, as well as injuries from the falls that do happen. Bodily Defenses Knowing the underlying causes of falls suffered by older people will help you appreciate the steps experts recommend to prevent them. Heading the list of causes for otherwise healthy people is loss of muscle strength followed by diminished flexibility, which together result in instability and a decreased ability to catch yourself should you start to fall, Mr. Franklin said at a recent meeting sponsored by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and the National Athletic Trainers Association. Then there are medical factors, of which osteoarthritis  the wear-and-tear kind  is most prominent. Arthritis can make joints stiff and painful, resulting in a loss of flexibility and mobility. Some medications taken by older people can cause dizziness or sleepiness and impair balance. People who have suffered a stroke or other neurological disorder may be unable to move normally. Other predisposing factors common among older people include cardiovascular disease and accumulated injuries that weaken the musculoskeletal system. Diminished vision caused perhaps by cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration or lack of proper glasses is also a factor in falls among the elderly. And when older people fall, their weakened bones are more likely to break. As many as one woman in four and one man in 15 over the age of 50 can expect to suffer a fracture during their remaining years. So, the first step is to build muscle strength in the thighs and trunk to increase stability. Try this simple exercise: Lie on your back on the floor and raise one leg at a time a foot off the floor, holding it there for 10 seconds. Gradually build up to 10 repetitions with each leg and youll see how much stronger your thigh muscles can get. Likewise, there are easy exercises to improve balance: Gently holding the back of a sturdy chair, raise one foot off the floor, then try to let go of the chair. Once that is mastered, try it with your eyes closed, then try it standing on your toes. Tai chi is also an excellent activity proven to improve balance and reduce falls. Daily stretches, especially of the legs and hips, can slow the loss of flexibility that can result in a fall. People over 50  and especially those over 65  should have annual eye exams by an ophthalmologist and not postpone getting new glasses or undergoing cataract surgery. Corneal implants inserted when cataracts are removed can improve visual acuity better than your current glasses. If you take medications, ask your pharmacist whether any of them, alone or in combination, may cause dizziness or sleepiness. If so, ask your doctor if a reduced dosage or another medication would be just as effective and safer. Dont forget dem bones, which need to be strong if they are to remain intact should you fall. In addition to consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, you need to do weight-bearing exercise. Bone-benefiting exercises include walking, step and water aerobics, dancing, yoga, tai chi, hiking and resistance training. Cycling and swimming, while excellent activities especially for people with arthritis, are not as effective as walking for strengthening bones, Mr. Franklin said. For additional guidance, see Fall Prevention by Gail Davies and Fran Scully (Infinity Publishing, 2006).

Daily stretches, especially of the legs and hips, can slow the loss of flexibility that can result in a fall. People over 50  and especially those over 65  should have annual eye exams by an ophthalmologist and not postpone getting new glasses or undergoing cataract surgery. Corneal implants inserted when cataracts are removed can improve visual acuity better than your current glasses. If you take medications, ask your pharmacist whether any of them, alone or in combination, may cause dizziness or sleepiness. If so, ask your doctor if a reduced dosage or another medication would be just as effective and safer. Dont forget dem bones, which need to be strong if they are to remain intact should you fall. In addition to consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, you need to do weight-bearing exercise. Bone-benefiting exercises include walking, step and water aerobics, dancing, yoga, tai chi, hiking and resistance training. Cycling and swimming, while excellent activities especially for people with arthritis, are not as effective as walking for strengthening bones, Mr. Franklin said. For additional guidance, see Fall Prevention by Gail Davies and Fran Scully (Infinity Publishing, 2006). Environmental Protection About half of falls occur at home, so thats the best place to start to prevent them.

Skip to next paragraph Blogs The Empire Zone Coverage of politics in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. A group of tenants, who have deplored the loss of middle-class housing, tried this week to disrupt the sale by Metropolitan Life by asking the city comptroller to investigate whether the insurer had complied with state housing law. MetLife quickly denounced the move as a “desperate” tactic, although the comptroller’s office is going ahead with a review. In any event, Tishman Speyer and its partner, BlackRock Realty, completed the largest real estate deal in American history in 30 days, closing on 11,232 apartments in 110 buildings  much faster than most people buy a house or a condominium. The undistinguished red-brick buildings between 14th and 23rd Streets have none of the glamour of other properties run by Tishman Speyer, like Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building. But the complexes have a special place in the hearts of generations of current and former New Yorkers. “This was a special place,” said Alvin Doyle, president of the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association. “It’s the passing of an era, or the beginning of a new era.” Mr. Doyle has lived in Stuyvesant Town since he was born in 1952. His father, a reporter for The Daily Mirror, was one of the first tenants to move in after MetLife built the complexes in 1947 for returning veterans. His mother, Therese, still lives there. The sale also marks the denouement of a remarkable chapter in MetLife’s history: It built 24,682 apartments in 180 buildings at four complexes in Manhattan and the Bronx during the 1940s, when the city was desperate for affordable housing, much as it is today. In return for tax breaks and other subsidies at three of the four complexes, MetLife agreed to limit its return to 6 percent and to hold down rents. MetLife sold its largest and oldest development, the Parkchester in the Bronx, to an investor, Harry Helmsley, for $90 million in 1968 and the Riverton Houses in Harlem to Charles A. Vincent for $12.5 million in 1976. The prospective sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village this year set off a frenzy among buyers from New York to Qatar and served as a lightning rod for the rising public anger over housing costs and the continuing loss of middle-class apartments in Manhattan. Nearly three-quarters of the apartments have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate. Many tenants fear that over time the complexes will become luxury enclaves. MetLife has said that its obligations to provide lower-cost housing expired in 1974, when its 25-year tax exemption ended. But that same year, the city agreed to grant MetLife an additional 10-year tax abatement and put the apartments in the rent stabilization program. In recent years, MetLife has sought to remove illegal subtenants and tenants whose principal residences are elsewhere. The new owners are expected to continue the practice. Tishman Speyer, which has tried to reassure tenants that it does not plan any drastic changes, says it is proud to have been selected as the “steward” for the properties. Still, housing advocates say that the company will be under pressure to produce a profit, given the extraordinary sales price.

In exchange, the insurance company had received millions of dollars in tax breaks. Skip to next paragraph Blogs The Empire Zone Coverage of politics in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. U.S.: The Caucus Now, the company was planning to move much of its operation to Midtown Manhattan. Under the terms of the 2001 deal, the Bloomberg administration could have penalized MetLife $24 million, or double the tax break it has received. But instead, the administration chose to fine the insurer $5 million and obtain another promise that it will retain at least 1,750 employees in New York City until 2026. The decision, which goes to the Industrial Development Agency today for approval, has surfaced at a time when New York appears on the verge of a new round of corporate poker with financial institutions, including Merrill Lynch, and other corporations threatening to move to New Jersey unless they get tax breaks and other incentives. Those opposed to such corporate subsidies assert that the citys decision on MetLife amounts to a slap on the wrist and calls into question the very logic of providing tax breaks to corporations making location decisions. Corporate retention deals havent produced the jobs they promise, said Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York, a group that promotes policies that hold government officials and corporations accountable to taxpayers. But Josh Serifman, acting president of the citys Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that the outcome of MetLifes expected move is more beneficial to the city than the original deal because the insurer was promising to keep 30 percent of its employees in Long Island City through 2014 and no fewer than 1,750 jobs in New York City until 2026. MetLife, which says the company wants to be back in the corporate mainstream in Midtown because the neighborhood has evolved, will not get any new tax breaks for its move across the East River. It will move about 1,280 of its 1,834 employees to far more expensive space in a skyscraper overlooking Bryant Park on Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street, where annual rents are more than $80 per square foot, or three times what MetLife is paying in Queens. The company expects to close this week on the largest real estate deal in American history with the $5.4 billion sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The city could face many more negotiations over tax breaks in the coming months. Lehman Brothers, Viacom, Disney and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which have leases that will expire in the next few years, are all looking for large blocks of prime office space in Manhattan, where vacant space has become increasingly expensive and hard to find. The companies routinely look at sites on both sides of the Hudson River and then bargain with New York City and New Jersey for the best deal. Merrill Lynch, one of the largest employers in Lower Manhattan, has now formally joined the fray, with company officials and its brokers at Jones Lang LaSalle saying that the investment bank is looking at all its options, including New Jersey. Merrills lease at the World Financial Center expires in 2013. Opponents of such subsidies say they are worried that history will repeat itself. In 1997, the city and the state provided Merrill with a combined $28.6 million in tax breaks and grants after the company threatened to move almost 3,900 employees to Jersey City. Rather than growing, Merrills city workforce, like MetLifes, has declined. More recently, real estate brokers say that Merrill and other investment banks want to duplicate both the technology and the government subsidies that Goldman Sachs recently got to build a new headquarters near the World Financial Center. State and city officials agreed to provide Goldman Sachs with $1.65 billion in tax-free bonds last year and more than $115 million in tax breaks, cash grants and other incentives. In response to news reports that Merrill might be bargaining for subsidies, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Sunday that he would not give the company a special deal. I think what we should do is use the money to make New York a place that companies employees want to live and work, he said, and that will get them to stay. The mayor added, Its a much more powerful draw and anchor for them than any subsidy. But Mr. Bloomberg left open the door for Merrill Lynch to obtain the kind of incentives that the city routinely offers to any other company. If the city opens its wallet to Merrill Lynch again, said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, it would potentially open the door for a whole list of financial and media companies to come back to the city for a second helping of tax breaks. Noting the mayors stand on Merrill Lynch, some landlords in the citys diamond district yesterday asked him to look at another matter before the Industrial Development Agency today: a proposal to give up to $37 million in tax breaks to a developer planning to build a 40-story tower for the diamond industry on 47th Street, west of Fifth Avenue. The MetLife deal dates to Mayor Rudolph W. Giulianis administration and is not unlike the deal that Merrill already has. After the insurer threatened a move to New Jersey in 2001, the city gave the company an incentive package worth $26.4 million to move senior management and most of its employees to a former auto factory in Long Island City. City Councilman Eric N. Gioia, who represents Long Island City, is unconvinced that such packages are good public policy. An ad hoc economic development policy of giving tax breaks to corporations that threaten to leave the city doesnt work, he said. This is the result. More Articles in New York Region »The Bloomberg administration faced a dilemma: Metropolitan Life was reneging on a five-year-old deal under which it had agreed to move 1,700 employees to Long Island City, Queens, and stay there until 2021, rather than relocate them to Jersey City.

STACOM has worked on many notable transactions in her lengthy career as a commercial real estate broker, but nothing compares to the deal she completed last month  anywhere. In a span of about 10 weeks, Ms. Stacom helped to sell all 110 apartment buildings at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, an 80-acre property along the East River in Manhattan, for a record-breaking price of $5.4 billion.

Shanahan, a colleague and part of her business team. Most other deals are one building or two buildings  this was 110 of them. The challenge was less the dollar amount than just the sheer magnitude of the amount of real estate. During those intense negotiations, Ms. Stacom put just about everything else in her professional and personal life on hold  save for her position as Class Mom for one of her two daughters. Ms. Stacom  dubbed Queen of the Skyscrapers by some in the industry  spent many years preparing her team for such a large transaction. In 2005 alone, she led the sale of more than $7.1 billion worth of real estate, which earned her the title of No. 1 Broker in the World at CB Richard Ellis, a company award to the broker who brings in the most revenue. Among her deals were the sale of several landmark residential properties, including the Sheffield apartment building on West 57th Street near Eighth Avenue, for $418 million, and the 583-unit Manhattan House on the Upper East Side, for $625 million, which was a Manhattan record of $1.072 million per apartment. Although Ms. Stacom said she had predicted that Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town would fetch a handsome sum, she was still surprised by the degree of interest shown in the property, especially from international quarters. Working from her corner office at 200 Park Avenue, she and her team used their sales skills to suggest ways to make the property even more attractive. Some in the industry had suggested a first step might be the removal of nonconforming tenants  those who are improperly subletting their rent-stabilized apartments or using them as pieds-à-terre. More than two-thirds of the apartments in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village are rent stabilized. Ms. Stacom suggested other uses for some of the apartments. We talked about senior housing being put into place, she said. We talked about extended-stay apartments for people going up for treatment at all the surrounding medical centers. They proposed adding amenities like gyms, as well as retail and professional office space. And Ms. Stacom suggested putting in sculpture gardens to draw tourists. She initially suggested that prospective buyers arrange a loaned-art program with the Museum of Modern Art. When Jerry I.

Is Windows Near End of Its Run? The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 12,000 for the first time on Thursday, the same day that a New York judge ordered the former head of the New York Stock Exchange to return most of his fiercely contested retirement package. Several statistics suggested inflation was slowing, but the latest corporate scandal accelerated. DOWN, BUT NOT OUT A New York judge ordered Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, to return as much as $100 million of the $139.5 million payout that he received when he resigned in September 2003. Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said Mr. Grasso did not disclose to other directors on the board of the exchange how salary increases had caused his pension and savings to balloon. The judge also said Mr. Grasso violated his contract by withdrawing millions from his retirement fund before he retired. The judge did not directly address the central claim in a lawsuit brought by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, that Mr. Grassos pay was unreasonable under the states not-for-profit law. But the ruling bolstered Mr. Spitzers argument that the exchanges board was not fully informed about Mr. Grassos compensation. Mr. Grasso said he would appeal, which would further delay a nonjury trial that had been scheduled to start last month. DOWN, BUT STILL UP Falling energy prices helped bring consumer prices down by half a percentage point in September, the Labor Department said, although the so-called core inflation rate  excluding food and energy prices  rose 0.2 percent, as it did in July and August. Economists and stock traders took the Consumer Price Index report, and another that said the number of new building permits fell in September for the seventh consecutive month, as evidence that the economy was slowing and that higher interest rates would not be needed soon. That optimism was tempered by the Labor Departments news that the core consumer inflation rate is running at 2.9 percent for the year  the highest level in almost 11 years. Federal Reserve policy makers will discuss interest rates on Tuesday and Wednesday; they are expected to keep rates at 5.25 percent. DOUBLING DOWN With sales growth in the United States slowing, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $1 billion for Trust-Mart, a group of Taiwanese-owned supermarkets in China, to become the biggest foreign chain in that rapidly expanding market. Acquiring Trust-Mart, which has more than 100 stores across China, pulls Wal-Mart even in China with Carrefour, the giant French retailer. The purchase also reverses Wal-Marts recent pullback abroad. In the last year, Wal-Mart has pulled out of Germany and South Korea, and has failed to make much headway against strong competitors in Japan and Britain. By more than doubling the number of stores Wal-Mart owns in China, this deal will help it secure lower prices from suppliers. That, in turn, could lead it to double in size again by 2010, one analyst said. DOUBLING UP The Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed to buy its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, for $8 billion, creating a global derivatives goliath that dwarfs other capital markets. The merged exchange would meld the Mercantile Exchanges strengths  as a major market for interest rate contracts, currencies and livestock  with the Board of Trades dominance of Treasury bond futures, grain contracts and now ethanol. Executives at both companies said they had been engaged in serious merger talks almost as soon as the Board of Trade first sold shares to the public a year ago. Once the merger is completed, probably in the middle of 2007, the exchanges will consolidate in the Board of Trades landmark 44-story Art Deco tower in Chicago. THE FINAL OPTION Dr. William W. McGuire, who built the UnitedHealth Group into one of the nations two largest health insurers, was forced to resign and give up a portion of the $1.1 billion he holds in stock options. A law firm hired by UnitedHealth to investigate its stock option grants concluded that the program was riddled with poor controls and conflicts of interest that permitted executives to backdate their options grants to maximize their compensation. Dr. McGuires departure came amid a federal investigation into whether more than 100 companies backdated stock options. Backdating lets companies pretend to have given options to managers just before stock prices jump, assuring the executives quick profits without having met performance goals that would benefit all shareholders. Scores of companies are rushing to restate their results to reflect lower profits and higher taxes attributable to suspicious options grants. REGULATOR FALLS Lester M. Crawford, former chief of the Food and Drug Administration, pleaded guilty to conflict of interest and lying about stock he and his wife owned in companies the agency regulates. Dr. Crawford sold stock in several companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Medtronic and Boston Scientific, before the Senate approved his nomination in July 2005. But he and his wife, Catherine, retained shares in Sysco, PepsiCo and Kimberly-Clark, each of which has businesses regulated by the agency. Prosecutors said Dr. Crawford also owned options to buy 41,500 shares in Embrex, a biotechnology company regulated by the F.D.A. Dr. Crawford is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22. He faces a maximum of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine on each of two counts. REAL ESTATE FRENZY Building permits and other indicators suggest a slowing real estate market, but that did not deter Tishman Speyer Properties from offering $5.4 billion to buy 110 apartment buildings in Manhattan, one of the biggest real estate transactions ever. The 11,232 apartments, in developments called Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, were built after World War II as affordable housing for returning veterans. Metropolitan Life, the insurance company that owns the apartments, said it expected to complete the sale before the end of the year. More Articles in Business »GOOD week for the stock market.

Is Windows Near End of Its Run? The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 12,000 for the first time on Thursday, the same day that a New York judge ordered the former head of the New York Stock Exchange to return most of his fiercely contested retirement package. Several statistics suggested inflation was slowing, but the latest corporate scandal accelerated. DOWN, BUT NOT OUT A New York judge ordered Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, to return as much as $100 million of the $139.5 million payout that he received when he resigned in September 2003. Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said Mr. Grasso did not disclose to other directors on the board of the exchange how salary increases had caused his pension and savings to balloon. The judge also said Mr. Grasso violated his contract by withdrawing millions from his retirement fund before he retired. The judge did not directly address the central claim in a lawsuit brought by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, that Mr. Grassos pay was unreasonable under the states not-for-profit law. But the ruling bolstered Mr. Spitzers argument that the exchanges board was not fully informed about Mr. Grassos compensation. Mr. Grasso said he would appeal, which would further delay a nonjury trial that had been scheduled to start last month. DOWN, BUT STILL UP Falling energy prices helped bring consumer prices down by half a percentage point in September, the Labor Department said, although the so-called core inflation rate  excluding food and energy prices  rose 0.2 percent, as it did in July and August. Economists and stock traders took the Consumer Price Index report, and another that said the number of new building permits fell in September for the seventh consecutive month, as evidence that the economy was slowing and that higher interest rates would not be needed soon.

Speyer, who controls some of the city’s most prominent landmarks, from Rockefeller Center to the Chrysler Building, yesterday signed the largest American real estate deal ever, agreeing to pay $5.4 billion for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a vast corridor of 110 apartment buildings along the East River.

Mr. Speyer, the chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, and his partner, the BlackRock investment bank, outmaneuvered more than a half-dozen other bidders, including a group aligned with tenants who had hoped to preserve the two adjoining complexes on First Avenue between 14th and 23rd Streets as enclaves of middle-class housing. But these are not typical real estate trophies. Built by Metropolitan Life for returning veterans in 1947, with the help of tax breaks and the government’s powers of eminent domain, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village have served as an affordable redoubt for generations of police officers, teachers, nurses and other middle-class New Yorkers. The unremarkable brick buildings, with 25,000 people living in 11,232 units, are nestled among trees and fountains on 80 acres of some of the most valuable real estate in the world. With rents and housing prices soaring in recent years, the pending sale turned the issue of affordable housing into a cause célèbre among New York politicians, including members of Congress, state legislators and City Council members. And the tenants feared that a new owner would transform the complexes into a luxury enclave. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stayed on the sidelines, and MetLife was intent on selling for the highest possible price. At $4.5 billion, the tenant offer lagged behind bids from some of the biggest names in real estate, from Apollo Real Estate Advisors in a joint offer with the Dermot Company, to the Related Companies with Lehman Brothers; the Millstein brothers; and Vornado Realty Trust. An elated Mr. Speyer appeared well aware of the complexes’ place in the city’s culture and the political sensitivity of the sale. “As a business with deep roots in New York City, we have a sincere appreciation for these cherished neighborhoods, and we are honored to become stewards of the property,” Mr. Speyer said. “We are committed to working closely with residents, elected officials and community leaders to ensure a dynamic and vibrant future for this New York community.” His son, Rob Speyer, a senior managing director at Tishman Speyer, also tried to reassure tenants, emphasizing, “There will be no sudden or dramatic shifts in the community’s makeup, character or charm.” But he would not commit to preserving a large block of apartments as affordable housing, which the tenant group had sought. MetLife said that the Speyers and BlackRock, a New York-based firm that is a major national real estate investor, would be “fine stewards of the property in the years to come.” Although Tishman Speyer is best known in New York for its commercial buildings, rather than residential development, the company has built housing in France, Germany, Brazil and soon, India. It built an apartment house in the late 1990’s on the Upper West Side and has another residential project in San Francisco. Tishman Speyer and BlackRock were among about eight companies invited to make final bids for the complexes on Monday afternoon. Apollo, the No. 2 bidder, came in at $5.33 billion. MetLife and its broker, Darcy Stacom of CB Richard Ellis, negotiated with Rob Speyer into the early-morning hours, then signed a contract at 10 a.m. yesterday. They plan to complete the deal in a month  three times faster than most buyers close on a single house. MetLife executives were not unfamiliar with the Speyers. Last year, his company bought the insurer’s 58-story skyscraper at 200 Park Avenue, at 45th Street, for $1.72 billion. “Clearly, Tishman Speyer has a proven track record with MetLife,” said Scott Rechler, chairman of Reckson Associates, who lost out in the bidding on that deal, despite a slightly higher offer. Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, called the sale a “dark day for affordable housing.” 1 2 Next Page » Damien Cave and Cassi Feldman contributed reporting.

Proponents acknowledge that the legislation, which was sponsored by 32 council members, cannot derail what promises to be the biggest real estate auction of a single property  the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes  in recent American history. The complexes have been an affordable redoubt for firefighters, teachers and utility workers over six decades. But the sponsors hope it will highlight the issue and increase political pressure on Metropolitan Life, which hopes to reap $5 billion from the sale, and on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an advocate of affordable housing who critics say has failed to intervene on behalf of the tenants. Residents and tenant advocates fear that a new owner will move aggressively to transform the two complexes, where nearly three-quarters of the 11,232 apartments along First Avenue, between 14th and 23rd Streets, have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate. “What’s at stake here is a lot of people’s lives,” said Judy Greene, 64, who has lived in Stuyvesant Town for 43 years and visited City Hall yesterday to support the bill. “You’ll lose a lot of people who are the backbone of the city. New York is pricing out middle-class, and even upper-middle-class, families.” The complexes’ fate is a family issue for Mrs. Greene, whose daughter and son-in-law also live in Stuyvesant Town. Her parents live in Peter Cooper Village. But the sale of the complexes has also become a cause célèbre at a time when the average apartment in Manhattan sells for more than $1 million and even a studio apartment rents for more than $2,000 a month. Senator Charles E. Schumer has urged MetLife’s chief executive, C. Robert Henrikson, to take a bid by tenants seriously. “I made the argument that the highest offer is not necessarily the best bid,” Mr. Schumer said. “He agreed with the concept.” A group aligned with the tenants has submitted a $4.5 billion offer intended to preserve at least 40 percent of the complexes as middle-class housing, for buyers or renters. But it falls about half a billion dollars short of higher bids from some of the biggest names in real estate, including Apollo Real Estate Advisors and the Dermot Company, Tishman Speyer, the Related Companies, the Kushner Companies and Vornado Realty. The legislation, introduced by Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, would require the owners of large-scale apartment complexes where more than half the units are rent-regulated to provide 120 days’ notice of a sale. The city’s housing department, in turn, would asses the impact of losing large numbers of apartments for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants. It is doubtful that the bill would be approved before MetLife completes the sale. The company, which built Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in 1947 for returning veterans with the help of city subsidies and the use of eminent domain, wants to close the deal in November. It has asked the final bidders, including the tenants, to submit their noncontingent offers by Monday. Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, who lives in a market-rate apartment in Peter Cooper and is a leader of the tenant bid, and others hope to create a climate in which MetLife would take a lower offer from the tenants, or that other bidders would preserve at least some of the apartments for middle-income families. Some bidders have opened discussions with the tenants through the Council’s speaker, Christine C. Quinn. Given the political uncertainties, one real estate executive involved in the bidding said a buyer would be foolish not to have a strategy for dealing with the issue of affordable housing. Mayor Bloomberg has so far rejected pleas to assist the tenant bid with property tax breaks or bonds. Bloomberg administration officials have told reporters on background that it would be cheaper to build housing in Queens, the Bronx or Brooklyn than to preserve the units at Stuyvesant Town. “MetLife owns it, and they have a right to sell it,” Mr. Bloomberg said during his radio program on Friday. Yesterday, State Senator Liz Krueger disputed the notion that it would cost more to preserve the apartments than to build new ones. “Somebody needs to go back to math and economics class,” she said. “Losing 11,000 units all at once destroys the math of the mayor’s plan.” Now, the Republican mayor must decide whether to veto the bill, although the Council may have enough votes to override him. He also has to consider a pledge by City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., a Democrat, to invest city pension funds in the tenant bid. Both men, as well as union leaders, have seats on the city’s five pension boards. The Central Labor Council has said it will provide mortgages for tenants who want to buy their apartments. A spokesman for the mayor said the city is reviewing the legislation. The Bloomberg administration has intervened in “private” deals in the past, including one for the West Village Houses. In return for the owner’s agreement to sell apartments to the tenants at a discount to fair market value, the city forgave $19 million on a city loan and provided a tax exemption. The agreement, the mayor said in 2004, would preserve affordable housing “in a neighborhood where tenants might otherwise have been priced out.” Tenant advocates say the city’s housing programs create apartments for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants by the dozens, while the sale of Stuyvesant Town raises the possibility of losing thousands of affordable apartments over time. An apartment can be decontrolled after it becomes vacant, or if the rent reaches $2,000 a month and the existing tenants’ household income rises above $175,000 for two consecutive years. The Tenants Political Action Committee estimates that as many as 300,000 affordable units in the city have been lost to decontrol in the last decade. “We have a huge issue here: the continuation of middle-income housing in New York City,” Mr. Thompson said. “Giving credit to the mayor, the city has done more to focus on low-, moderate- and middle-income housing than anyone in years. But we’re eroding units at almost the same rate as we create them.” More Articles in New York Region »The City Council jumped yesterday into the middle of a raging debate over the loss of middle-class housing in Manhattan, with a bill aimed at stalling the multibillion-dollar sale of two vast complexes on the East River.

Their offer was neither the highest nor the lowest in one of the biggest real estate auctions of all time. Metropolitan Life, the company that built Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town in 1947 for returning veterans, got roughly a dozen offers by its 3 p.m. deadline yesterday, ranging from $4.3 billion to slightly more than $5 billion, according to real estate executives. The rare opportunity to own 80 acres of prime property in Manhattan and 12,232 apartments has drawn national attention and bids from some of the biggest developers and residential developers in the country, as well as banks and foreign investors. Bidders include Related Companies, the Lefrak Organization and Apollo Real Estate Advisors. It has also touched off a raging political debate about the loss of middle-class housing in Manhattan as the current real estate boom has sent prices sky high. Nearly three-quarters of the apartments along First Avenue, between 14th and 23rd streets, have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate. In a bid to slow down the sale of the property and give a boost to the tenant bid, City Councilwoman Rosie Mendez said she plans to submit legislation next week that would slow down MetLifes plan to sell the property and boost the tenant bid. The legislation would require the owners of large residential properties, where more than half the apartments are rent-regulated, to notify the citys housing department 120 days prior to a sale. The city, in turn, would be required to assess the impact of the sale on the citys dwindling supply of housing affordable to low and middle-income families. The city could suggest ways of mitigating the problem, although it would not prevent the transaction. We have a housing crisis, Ms. Mendez said. The city really needs to take a look at this. It alarmed me how much affordable housing we might be losing. It is unlikely that the legislation by itself would offset the $500 million gap between the tenant offer and the highest bid. But the proposed bill has already picked up key support in the council and made some bidders nervous that the deal could be embroiled in politics and costly delays. Word of the proposed legislation circulated through the real estate industry yesterday, setting off alarms. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industrys powerful lobbying arm, said he opposed the bill, suggesting it was unconstitutional and risked exposing the city to lawsuits if the sale is upended. Im convinced it would be thrown out if it was passed, Mr. Spinola said. What are the fiscal implications. But Christine Quinn, the city Council speaker, was sympathetic to the proposal by Ms. Mendez. Well be giving the bill careful consideration, she said. Stuy Town and Peter Cooper in some ways represent New Yorks version of the American dream. People thought if they could make it if they got in. The decline of middle-class housing is a citywide problem. MetLife announced earlier this year that it was putting the two complexes up for sale and bridled at suggestions that the company had any continuing obligations to provide below-market housing. Real estate companies leaped at the deal. Company executives have suggested to city officials and reporters that many of the 25,000 residents of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, which has long been an affordable oasis for firefighters, nurses and teachers, made too much money to qualify for any kind of assistance. In recent years, MetLife has ousted illegal sublets and tenants whose apartments were not their primary residences. Under rent regulations, an apartment can also be decontrolled after it becomes vacant, or if the rent reaches $2,000 a month and the existing tenants household income rises above $175,000 for two successive years. As a result, about 27 percent of the 12,232 apartments are now at market rates. An additional 1,600 units will be decontrolled over the next two years, according to sale documents. But tenant advocates like Ms. Mendez and Councilman Daniel L. Garodnick, who lives in Peter Cooper Village, say that the city cannot afford to lose the middle class, which is coming under increasing pressure from high prices and rents, especially in Manhattan. Mr. Garodnick and the tenant association have assembled a group of developers, pension funds and union investments and a plan to convert the complex to a cooperative. They say it would preserve 20 percent of the apartments for middle-income families who rent and make another 20 percent affordable for residents who want to buy. The remaining apartments, under their plan, would be sold at market rates and at a slight discount to market. This is a stable working and middle-class community that we believe needs to be preserved, said Ed Ott, director of the citys Central Labor Council, which has agreed to provide mortgages for residents who want to buy their apartments. Mr. Ott estimated that 40 percent of the 25,000 residents were union members. Stuyvesant Town was built in 1947 under a contract with the city that limited MetLifes profit to 6 percent a year, in return for property condemnation by the city and a 25-year tax exemption intended to keep the rents low. Next door, the company built Peter Cooper Village, which has larger apartments, without tax exemptions. Company executives say that MetLife kept Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper affordable for 25 years after their agreement with the city expired. But it now has an obligation to get the best deal. But Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker, said that she hoped that MetLife takes the tenant offer seriously. MetLife also has an obligation to its shareholders, she said. Does this mean MetLife has to get the biggest dollar possible? They should remember all the support the city has give them historically and the critical role they play in providing middle-class housing in our city. More Articles in New York Region »A group aligned with tenants of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village submitted a $4.5 billion bid yesterday to buy the 110 apartment buildings overlooking the East River in the hope of retaining the complexes as middle-income housing. Their offer was neither the highest nor the lowest in one of the biggest real estate auctions of all time. Metropolitan Life, the company that built Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town in 1947 for returning veterans, got roughly a dozen offers by its 3 p.m. deadline yesterday, ranging from $4.3 billion to slightly more than $5 billion, according to real estate executives. The rare opportunity to own 80 acres of prime property in Manhattan and 12,232 apartments has drawn national attention and bids from some of the biggest developers and residential developers in the country, as well as banks and foreign investors. Bidders include Related Companies, the Lefrak Organization and Apollo Real Estate Advisors. It has also touched off a raging political debate about the loss of middle-class housing in Manhattan as the current real estate boom has sent prices sky high. Nearly three-quarters of the apartments along First Avenue, between 14th and 23rd streets, have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate. In a bid to slow down the sale of the property and give a boost to the tenant bid, City Councilwoman Rosie Mendez said she plans to submit legislation next week that would slow down MetLifes plan to sell the property and boost the tenant bid. The legislation would require the owners of large residential properties, where more than half the apartments are rent-regulated, to notify the citys housing department 120 days prior to a sale. The city, in turn, would be required to assess the impact of the sale on the citys dwindling supply of housing affordable to low and middle-income families. The city could suggest ways of mitigating the problem, although it would not prevent the transaction. We have a housing crisis, Ms. Mendez said. The city really needs to take a look at this. It alarmed me how much affordable housing we might be losing. It is unlikely that the legislation by itself would offset the $500 million gap between the tenant offer and the highest bid. But the proposed bill has already picked up key support in the council and made some bidders nervous that the deal could be embroiled in politics and costly delays.

In 2008 alone, 800 apartments in Stuyvesant Town could be deregulated, according to marketing material that the broker for Metropolitan Life, the current owner, is giving to potential bidders. If the projections prove correct, the material says, the rents collected could more than double by 2018 to nearly $519 million at Stuyvesant Town and to $170 million at Peter Cooper, which together contain 11,200 units. MetLifes brokerage company, which prepared the document, has some tips, too, for potential buyers hoping to appeal to what it calls the discerning tastes of Manhattans market-rate apartment community. It suggests turning the complexes into gated communities, adding health club amenities, selling units, importing doormen and installing an elite private school. The 117-page offering memorandum may paint an overly rosy picture of a new owners possible profits in hopes of enticing bidders for what could be a $5 billion sale, but it also suggests strongly that the communitys days as an unpretentious middle-class bastion in increasingly upscale Manhattan may well be numbered. With aggressive investigation of potential stabilization violations, the memo suggests, a new owner could deregulate 1,000 units in both complexes in 2008 alone, approximately double the current rate. By investing in major capital improvements, a new owner could speed up rent deregulation and win additional rent increases, even in the rent-stabilized apartments. As more apartments are deregulated and higher-income tenants move in, the brokerage firm speculates, demand for garage space will increase and garage income will go up. The loop roadways in the 80-acre property could be reserved for resident monthly parkers with revenue potential approaching $1 million. New ownership has infinite opportunities to personalize, improve and transform the complex into the citys most prominent market-rate master community, say the documents from the broker, CB Richard Ellis. The memo says the transformation of the two complexes along the East River is already well underway, led by MetLifes aggressive capital improvement program. It recently committed or spent $168 million on improvements including electrical upgrades and new roofs and windows. Under rent regulations, owners can pass on to tenants a portion of the cost of such capital improvements, pushing their rents toward the $2,000-a-month level at which they can be decontrolled (for an occupied unit, the tenants annual household income would also have to reach $175,000 for two consecutive years). The memo points out that any new owner of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper will be the beneficiary of these paybacks.  Critics of MetLifes sale plans were not enthusiastic. Its clear, and this makes it clearer, that MetLifes strategy for making several billion dollars on this site is to speculate on the aggressive displacement of middle-income New Yorkers and their replacement with wealthy New Yorkers, said Brad Lander, the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a housing and planning advocacy group. I had assumed that was implicit. The fact that MetLife is offering a road map for that displacement in their offering materials makes plain their intentions. Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who is trying to organize a tenant-backed bid to buy Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, where he lives, said of MetLife, I think that they have a vision of this community which is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was founded and which will have a big-picture effect on the affordability of housing in New York City. Darcy Stacom, the broker handling the sale, dismissed the suggestion that the marketing documents serve as a road map for displacement. She said she had simply come up with some value-added ideas for transactions. Under the rent laws, she said, anyone whose income qualifies him to remain in a stabilized apartment even after his rent reaches $2,000 a month is going to live there for the rest of their lives. Ms. Stacom also said that, in light of recent sale prices of comparable buildings, if you look at this deal on a by-the-pound basis, its dirt cheap. MetLife, which opened Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village as housing for veterans returning from World War II, put the 110-building community on the block last month. Some of the citys biggest landlords, real estate companies and banks have signed up to bid. The deadline for initial offers is Oct. 5. Mr. Garodnick wants the complexes to remain largely affordable to middle-income New Yorkers, in part because they were built with help from the city. The city acquired some of the land through eminent domain, gave MetLife the streets in the 18-block area and froze property taxes for 25 years at the value of the land before redevelopment. Look, its nice to live in luxury, said Leonard Grunstein, a lawyer representing the tenants association, which is working with Mr. Garodnick. But this was built to be affordable. It was built to give good housing so people could live and work in the community.

Garodnick: He surreptitiously flexes a forefinger and, with a brief application of spit and polish, the smudge is no more. Candy wrappers in the hallway outside his one-bedroom apartment get similar treatment. He spirits them away to the trash, and not because he’s an obsessive-compulsive neatnik. No, his behavioral complex is more complicated than that: There’s marketable Manhattan real estate on the line here, and pride of ownership, though premature, in his newfound solicitude toward Peter Cooper’s every facade. Doesn’t everybody want to be his own landlord? Doesn’t everybody maintain an umbilical connection to neighborhoods that provided a stress-free childhood? Mr. Garodnick, the son of a financial adviser and a retired schoolteacher, can see the apartment building where his parents have lived for nearly 40 years right from his own living room window. Comforting. Mr. Garodnick, 34, single, and an avowed front-liner in the generation-in-a-hurry-to-make-its-mark, must be forgiven for behaving as if he owns a piece of this place (and for hoping there is no conflict of interest, City Council-wisely, in his trying to). In his best-laid plans, he will retain a stake in it  he and some 25,000 other occupants, many of them long-term renters, like his parents, of the 11,200 apartments in Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, adjacent residential behemoths owned for 60 years by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. This summer, MetLife put the entire community on the block, with a suggested selling price of $5 billion, a sum that presumably presages a conversion to luxury co-ops or condos  which means that over time, the middle class will be priced out and a unique neighborhood designed for and amenable to working families will cease to be. Mr. Garodnick says he would find that appalling even if he were not a lifelong Stuyvesant/Peter Cooper resident (except for college and a short rental nearby at 21st and Third, he has never lived anyplace else) and a proponent of moderate-priced housing. Too bad MetLife seems to disagree with him. “Well, $5 billion, that’s their price, and it seems like an astronomical price to me,” says Mr. Garodnick, positioning himself in a colonial-reproduction wing chair stenciled with gold stars. “Gold-plated luxury condos and working-class people don’t mix.” Mr. Garodnick, an only child who lived in Stuyvesant Town until he was 4, and then in Peter Cooper (his parents moved in pursuit of air-conditioning), is indignant. “I did not expect one-fifth of my Council district to go up for sale,” he says. “In a beautiful world, MetLife would recognize that not only do they have an opportunity to make a profit here, but they have an opportunity to do right by the city by dealing directly and fairly with the people who live here. But how much affordability do you get out of $5 billion? Not much.” His math puts it at $450,000 per unit; perhaps not too steep for young professionals like him, who pay market-rate rents of about $2, 700 to $3,200, for one-bedroom apartments, but too much for many of his neighbors. Stuyvesant and Peter Cooper are a cradle-to-grave neighborhood with residents in baby carriages and wheelchairs, not a hip, hot area: “Nobody ever accused me of being cool,” says Mr. Garodnick, a graduate of Trinity, Dartmouth College, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a law degree. His interest in working for the civil rights division of the Justice Department fizzled when John Ashcroft took over  “I was not convinced of his commitment to civil rights”  so he took a job as a litigator at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, a Manhattan firm, before running for the Council on a reform/constituent services agenda. His antidote to MetLife? Organize the tenants  with the help of investors who are likely to include the New York City Central Labor Council and with political clout supplied by a Who’s Who of elected officials that includes Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer  to bid on the properties and “take control of their housing destiny.” Not a simple task, particularly with a seemingly hostile landlord: Mr. Garodnick’s request on Sept. 1 to review the bidding requirements was rebuffed in a hurry. He is not their favorite tenant, particularly not after he led a tenant insurrection against the switch from traditional locks on the lobby doors to electronic keycards bearing the users’ photographs (MetLife won that one, citing enhanced tenant safety; Mr. Garodnick says it’s not the keycards he dislikes but the surveillance information they provide to landlords). LAST week, MetLife, courting offers from several of the city’s most powerful developers (Mr. Garodnick was told that of the city’s major real estate players, only Donald Trump has declared the site beneath his radar) refused to accept a bid from the tenant association It deemed the tenants group an unqualified bidder. Two days later, after being pressured by elected officials, MetLife reversed itself. Mr. Garodnick’s consortium received the bid books early this week; bids are due on Oct. 5. “MetLife has stacked the deck against us, first by stalling for 18 days, and now giving us an Oct. 5 deadline for first bids that really puts us in a squeeze,” he says. “I was initially skeptical about our ability to be competitive: how on earth does anybody put together $5 billion?

In return, the Giuliani administration granted the company $26.4 million in tax breaks. Now it is planning a trip back across the East River. Within the next several days, MetLife is expected to sign a tentative deal to move the bulk of its 1,700 workers back to Manhattan, into a 42nd Street skyscraper  the former Verizon Building  where the rents are at least triple what it pays in Queens, according to city officials and executives working with the company. MetLife declined to comment, saying it does not discuss speculation in the marketplace. MetLife has told the Bloomberg administration that it needs a substantial Manhattan presence since it is now the largest life insurer in North America, according to city officials, who have been negotiating with the company for more than a month to keep some workers in Queens. Under the terms of the original deal, the city could demand that the company repay two times the roughly $12 million in incentives it has used up to now. The Queens neighborhood has seen a good deal of development  some commercial, but especially residential  but MetLifes decision is considered a setback for the citys effort to develop Long Island City, and Queens Plaza in particular, as an alternative to low-cost office space in Jersey City. MetLifes departure doesnt help, said Barry M. Gosin, chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate company. Long Island City is a great opportunity waiting to happen. Somebody has to do something big out there in order for it to get traction. City Councilman Eric Gioia, who represents the neighborhood, said he regretted the insurers decision. But, he added: They got a lot of taxpayer benefits to move here. The city should recoup every dime. Senior company executives apparently found the gritty Queens neighborhood lacking in good restaurants and too far from Midtown, though it is a few subway stops away. The company also complained that an early-morning bus dropped off prisoners released from Rikers Island jails on a street corner about four blocks away from its front door. Senior executives and about 1,200 other employees would move to the former Verizon Building, a 41-story skyscraper overlooking Bryant Park at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas. Real estate executives say that annual rents in the tower, which is undergoing a $260 million makeover, are about $80 per square foot. The plans to return renew questions about the wisdom of plying large companies with tax breaks to keep them from relocating employees outside the city. In 2001, MetLife threatened to move to New Jersey to reduce the cost of operating in the city, according to the subsequent agreement it signed with the city. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani granted the millions in subsidies to lure it out to a former automobile factory in Queens, where rents were about $25 a square foot. MetLifes decision to move back to Manhattan highlights the ineffectiveness of giving away multimillions in tax incentives to individual firms, said Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York nonprofit research group. It seems like the city always gets burned in the end. MetLife is certainly entitled to move back to Manhattan if that will help them be more competitive in attracting and retaining employees, but the company shouldnt be allowed to use city subsidies to do so. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has generally opposed granting the kind of tax breaks that were so popular under the Giuliani administration. The city does not want to alienate the company, either, especially since it had considered moving everyone out of Queens, officials said. The city has sought a longer commitment from MetLife to keep a contingent of workers in Long Island City and a larger number of employees in New York City as a whole. Under the terms of the current deal, officials said, MetLife could relocate up to 30 percent of its Queens employees next year. Today, MetLife has a total of 2,500 employees in New York City, down from 2,860 in 2001. Were encouraging MetLife to keep a critical mass of jobs in Long Island City, said Joshua J. Sirefman, acting president of the citys Economic Development Corporation. We would like to have them extend the length of their commitment to both Long Island City, New York City generally. We intend to do so without granting any additional benefits. MetLife, which acquired Travelers Life and Annuity last year in an $11.5 billion deal, is a larger, more important global corporation than when it moved to Queens. But it has a shrinking presence in New York City, where it began in 1863 and counted 17,000 employees during the 1960s. After moving most of its employees to Long Island City, MetLife sold its three major buildings in Manhattan for $3.3 billion, including its 50-story clock tower and two-towered headquarters on Madison Avenue. It kept a boardroom and a small corporate suite at 200 Park Avenue, the former Pan Am Building. Recently, MetLife put the two middle-class apartment complexes it built for returning World War II veterans  Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town  on the auction block, hoping to get about $5 billion. That decision has drawn feverish interest from potential bidders, and criticism from politicians who lamented the possibility that rent regulations on 11,200 apartments could be lost in a sale. MetLifes decision does not help the Queens Plaza neighborhood, where developers have waited for years for an anchor tenant for a new commercial complex. But blocks away, Long Island Citys main commercial district near the 48-story Citigroup Tower is finally thriving. Citigroup is erecting a second building, and the United Nations Federal Credit Union and the New York Blood Bank are moving in nearby. A developer is converting the former Eagle Electric factory into luxury lofts. Im sorry to see them go, especially now because Long Island City had reached a positive tipping point, Councilman Gioia said. Every day new restaurants and people are moving in.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Uli Seit for The New York Times The complexs parklike courtyard gives residents a sense of community. Now these two complexes are at the center of a red-hot auction that will allow the winner to claim 110 buildings and 11,200 apartments. But at first glance, the proposed sale of the complexes by Metropolitan Life, their original owner, might seem like an unlikely candidate for deal of the year. Nearly three-quarters of the apartments, built in the 1940s to house veterans returning from World War II, are subject to rent regulation. MetLife projects that the net operating income this year for the two complexes will be $112.1 million, rising to $167.4 million next year. That means that the initial return for an investor paying the target price of more than $4 billion would be far less than the 5 percent or so yield on a Treasury bill. Yet the sale, which comes at a time when rents in the city are rapidly rising, has spurred widespread interest from prospective real estate developers and investors, a number of whom are scrambling to meet MetLifes Oct. 5 deadline for placing their offers. Potential buyers include many well-known real estate players  from residential developers like the Lefrak Organization and the Related Companies to investment funds like Starwood Capital Group and ING Clarion and publicly traded real estate investment trusts like Vornado Realty Trust and Archstone-Smith. Because the deal is likely to require as much $1.5 billion in equity, the buyer is almost certain to be a joint venture of two or more companies, real estate specialists said.

A recent study for the Brookings Institution found that the New York region had a smaller share of middle-income families than any other major metropolitan area in the nation in 2000. Manhattan is the poster child for this problem -- only 8 percent of the island's neighborhoods are predominantly middle income. Absent a concerted effort by the city to preserve modestly affordable apartments in one of its few remaining middle-class havens, it faces a dismal future as the sole preserve of the haves and the have-nots. Alan Berube Washington, Aug. 30, 2006 The writer is a fellow at the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program. To the Editor: My wife, my 3-year-old twins and I live in a rent-stabilized Stuyvesant Town apartment. I work in a nonprofit social service agency 20 blocks away. To say it is a dream come true for this Midwestern suburban boy to be able to afford raising his children in such a diverse and stimulating urban environment a short walk from work might be an understatement. But I have long contended that the lifeblood of New York City is change and progress. Is eliminating housing for the middle class progress? Maybe not. But perhaps progress will come when we re-evaluate the 60-year-old rent stabilization laws that have artificially fed this housing craze. (I consider myself liberal, but that doesn't allow me to deny facts.) David Billotti New York, Aug. 30, 2006 To the Editor: My girlfriend and I moved into Stuyvesant Town only three months ago and have very mixed feelings about the pending sale. On the one hand, we are not in a rent-controlled apartment, and it was somewhat disheartening to hear that some people are paying less for a three-bedroom apartment than we are paying for a one-bedroom. On the other hand, we moved there because although it is in New York City, it has the feel of a community. We both realize we will never find this anywhere else in Manhattan and hope that the sale of the property will not change this. Danny Hojnowski New York, Aug. 31, 2006 To the Editor: My wife and I moved to Peter Cooper Village in 2003, paying a market rate for our two-bedroom apartment. Our family has grown to include two daughters since we arrived. This week, we received our lease renewal form, which increases the rent 23 percent, offers only a one-year lease to replace our current two-year lease, and clearly states that the price is nonnegotiable. Large rent increases given to market-rate tenants, which are happening now in preparation for the sale, will push out young families like ours.

Garodnick, who grew up in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village and now represents their 25,000 residents on the City Council, intends to announce today that he is organizing a group of investors who, with the backing of tenants and the Council speaker, will try to buy the two complexes and keep them affordable to the middle class. Under Mr. Garodnick’s plan, the investors, likely to include union pension funds and banks, would bid on the properties, which Metropolitan Life hopes to sell for as much as $5 billion. The group would ask the Bloomberg administration for assistance, perhaps in the form of financing and tax incentives, to help make the deal work. “Stuyvesant Town is a middle-class community, and we do not want to lose that identity to the highest bidder,” said Mr. Garodnick, who, like his parents, still lives in Peter Cooper Village. “The tenants are not going to sit by and watch it become a place of pieds-à-terre. This is a place where people live and work in New York City.” MetLife’s decision to try to sell the 11,200-apartment complexes on the East Side of Manhattan has attracted interest from many of the city’s biggest developers, real estate families and investment banks. It is widely assumed that a buyer who pays up to $5 billion for the property will want, over time, to convert it to luxury apartments. Mr. Garodnick said he wanted to ensure that current tenants could continue to live in their apartments, either as renters or by buying units at prices they could afford. Nearly three-quarters of the residents are in units that currently fall under the state’s rent regulation laws and rent for as little as half the market rate. One group interested in working with Mr. Garodnick is the New York City Central Labor Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Kevin P. Gallagher, the council’s director of housing, said the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s $5 billion housing investment trust has been used over the past four years to finance 12,000 units of low-priced housing in New York City alone. “The trust sees this as an opportunity to double their work in one project,” Mr. Gallagher said. “The trust would be a financing source for the transaction. What we’re looking to do is to provide tools for them, and the money, so that the tenants can become homeowners and not worry about a middleman coming in and driving up the value.” Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who has written to the chairman of MetLife endorsing the plan, said she was optimistic about Mr. Garodnick’s chances of success, given the number of tenants involved, the importance of the complex as middle-class housing and MetLife’s reputation in the city. “I think any time you have a large real estate transaction where the seller is somebody who has been a respected corporate citizen and wants to continue to be a corporate citizen, that commitment  that reputation  weighs in the deal,” Ms. Quinn said in an interview. “That always works in your favor.” There are some recent precedents for such a transaction in New York City. The tenants of the West Village Houses, a 420-unit complex, worked out a cooperative conversion plan with the owner several years ago when it appeared that rents there might triple. More than half the tenants bought their units at a discount rate. Mr. Gallagher said his organization provided financing. The city arranged for tax incentives and other subsidies for sellers and buyers. In the late 1990’s, an organization called CPC Resources took over Parkchester, a 12,200-unit apartment complex in the Bronx where an effort to convert to condominiums was unsuccessful. With backing from banks and tax abatements from both the city and the state, CPC Resources rescued the place from deterioration, put it back on sound financial footing and ensured that the units remained affordable for the existing tenants. “What you’re talking about is trying to figure out a program for how to preserve that affordability,” said Michael Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit housing group, and CPC Resources. In the case of Parkchester, he said, some of the money made from the sale of market-rate units was used to enable elderly residents to stay in their units. Mr. Garodnick, a 34-year-old lawyer elected to the City Council last November, said he began working with the tenants’ association of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village last month to try to figure out how to preserve the complex as a place for the middle class. He said he had spoken with a number of potential investors, including banks, interested in teaming up with the tenants in part out of a sense of social responsibility. “Obviously, nobody’s doing it solely out of the goodness of their hearts,” he said. “There will be an opportunity to make money.” John Marsh, 41, a computer programmer who grew up in Peter Cooper Village and is a member of the tenants’ association board, said one challenge would be to get an agreement among tenants on how best to proceed. If the apartments are converted to co-ops or condos and sold at a discount, for example, what limits should there be on when residents could sell them again, and at what price? James J. Roth, 57, a retired F.B.I. agent and a board member, said that if the tenants could present a unified front, they might have some leverage over which bidder bought the complex. For example, under the co-op and condominium conversion law, an owner would need 15 percent of the tenants to buy their units for a so-called noneviction conversion. A unified tenant body could presumably veto a buyer, Mr. Roth said. More Articles in New York Region »Daniel R. Garodnick, who grew up in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village and now represents their 25,000 residents on the City Council, intends to announce today that he is organizing a group of investors who, with the backing of tenants and the Council speaker, will try to buy the two complexes and keep them affordable to the middle class. Under Mr. Garodnick’s plan, the investors, likely to include union pension funds and banks, would bid on the properties, which Metropolitan Life hopes to sell for as much as $5 billion. The group would ask the Bloomberg administration for assistance, perhaps in the form of financing and tax incentives, to help make the deal work. “Stuyvesant Town is a middle-class community, and we do not want to lose that identity to the highest bidder,” said Mr. Garodnick, who, like his parents, still lives in Peter Cooper Village. “The tenants are not going to sit by and watch it become a place of pieds-à-terre. This is a place where people live and work in New York City.” MetLife’s decision to try to sell the 11,200-apartment complexes on the East Side of Manhattan has attracted interest from many of the city’s biggest developers, real estate families and investment banks. It is widely assumed that a buyer who pays up to $5 billion for the property will want, over time, to convert it to luxury apartments. Mr. Garodnick said he wanted to ensure that current tenants could continue to live in their apartments, either as renters or by buying units at prices they could afford. Nearly three-quarters of the residents are in units that currently fall under the state’s rent regulation laws and rent for as little as half the market rate.

THE announcement, last week, that Metropolitan Life intends to sell Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village to the highest bidder has given new life to the familiar worry that people of modest means can no longer afford to live in New York, particularly in Manhattan. The fear and fact of middle-class flight are age-old New York phenomena; indeed, it was a version of this anxiety that helped raise Stuyvesant Town in the first place. The immediate post-World War II years were marked by a devastating housing shortage. Returning soldiers and families moving up from the tenements found few options they could either abide or afford. Met Life planned Stuyvesant Town to meet this need, envisioning the project as a suburb in the city, a place where middle-class families could enjoy the greenery, space and modern accommodations of the suburbs along with the convenience of urban living. It is hard now to recall the downright eventfulness of Stuyvesant Towns arrival on the Lower East Side. Today the projects austere brick towers tend to disappear in the skyline, but in the late 40s and early 50s Stuyvesant Town was a Manhattan landmark. Magazines and newspapers around the world tracked its progress from drawing board to construction to move-in. Built with generous city and state subsidies, Met Lifes project pioneered the practice of urban renewal, serving as the inspiration for similar slum clearance projects like Penn South, Lincoln Towers and Washington Square Village. And yet the familiar refrain should not disguise the fact that Stuyvesant Town has become, in many ways, a casualty of its own success. From the very beginning, Stuyvesant Towns benefits came with a number of conditions. Veterans were given preference and only two-parent families were eligible. Most important, though, Met Life planned to bulldoze an old Lower East Side neighborhood called the Gas House District and follow a strict whites-only policy in renting out apartments in the new development. In 1943, when Stuyvesant Town was announced, the Gas House District  named for the gas storage and distribution sites that dominated the northern edge of the neighborhood  was little different from the area to its south that we today call the East Village. A polyglot collection of European immigrants and their children lived and worked in 18 blocks of tenements, storefronts and warehouses. Rents in the neighborhood were about half what Stuyvesant Town planned to charge: one study determined that no more than 3 percent of the 3,000 Gas House District families would be able to afford it. Residents of the area rose to defend their homes, but their protests largely fell on deaf ears. The promise of Stuyvesant Town was just too alluring. The neighborhood had problems  run-down and abandoned buildings, the stench and danger of the gas works  but clearance also dispersed the relations of kinship, friendship and commerce that come to characterize a neighborhood. As the urban renewal projects inspired by Stuyvesant Town obliterated acre after acre of working-class, black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods, New Yorkers came to feel these losses more deeply. By the mid-1960s, few were willing to countenance the kind of destruction Stuyvesant Town had required. Of all the controversies that attended the building of Stuyvesant Town, the campaign to desegregate the project attracted the most attention. Met Life, like most housing developers of the time, believed that renting to blacks would jeopardize its investment. As a private landlord, the insurance giant thought itself well within its rights to restrict residency. A broad coalition of black and white civil rights activists  some of whom were project residents  disagreed, claiming that Stuyvesant Towns public subsidy subjected it to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Their protests resulted in legislation prohibiting discrimination in all city housing, and in 1952 Met Life finally relented, bowing to public pressure and the letter of the new city law. But civil rights activists were more successful at pioneering legislation than in securing actual integration in the new spaces inspired by Stuyvesant Town. In fact, Stuyvesant Town itself didnt have a substantial black population until the 1970s. With a few exceptions, urban renewal projects served to reinforce already existing patterns of racial segregation. They reclaimed desirable real estate for white-collar institutions and provided bastions of middle-class urban living for primarily white populations. Meanwhile, public housing, often built on cheaper land within existing ghettos, became overwhelmingly black and Puerto Rican, in a pattern of segregation that continues to bedevil us half a century later. Of course, Stuyvesant Town should not shoulder the blame for this turn of events, but the racial divisions it predicted for the new cityscape of urban renewal remain its deepest and most discouraging legacy. Stuyvesant Town has always been a pleasant refuge from the city. Many of its residents fought, over the years, to make it a more inclusive place. We are right to rue the loss of this city institution  theres no doubt that we are all the poorer for it. But however congenial life in Stuyvesant Town has been for those lucky enough to live there, the projects less savory legacy should not be forgotten. Having begun its life as the state-of-the-art method for supplanting working-class neighborhoods with middle-class apartment towers and white-collar institutions, Stuyvesant Town will end up as a victim of a newer, less abrupt and violent version of the very forces of urban change it helped unleash more than 50 years ago.

I was a Stuyvesant Town snob: splendidly middle class, admirably unpretentious. When I told people that I grew up in Stuyvesant Town they knew not only the scene of my childhood, but my familys values, as well. They knew we were clean and orderly (Stuyvesant Town applicants had to pass inspection in their previous dwellings); frugal (Stuyvesant Town was a remarkable bargain); child-centered (there was no fitness center for the grown-ups, but there were 12 playgrounds for the children.) They also knew we felt ourselves to be among the elect. You couldnt just walk in and rent an apartment in Stuyvesant Town, you submitted yourself to an arduous application process. If you passed muster, your name was added to the waiting list. It could take years. A three-bedroom apartment like ours was so coveted that only people who had spent years of model tenancy in a two-bedroom apartment could ever hope to acquire one. Stuyvesant Town wasnt just an address, it was an achievement. Most important, it was a community and a way of life. Now when I say Stuyvesant Town, people will look at me differently. Its not that Ive changed, but that Stuyvesant Town itself is about to change. Metropolitan Life is putting Stuyvesant Town and its sister housing complex, Peter Cooper Village, on the auction block. It will certainly be entirely revamped and repackaged as an altogether different kind of place. Not only will it have a face lift, but its character will be redefined.

But many residents wonder how long middle-class families can afford to live there. Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Stuyvesant Town tenant Bobby Medoro, with his 2-year-old son Nicholas. Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Stuyvesant Town tenants Diana Scalera, left, Eric Zanier and Gerald Striker. Nearly three-quarters of the 11,200 apartments in the two complexes, which Metropolitan Life is offering for sale, currently fall under the states rent regulation system and rent for as little as half the open-market rate. But a new owner who pays the $4 billion to $5 billion that MetLife is said to want may have a powerful financial incentive to try to remove many or most of those units from the rent regulation system. While state law would prevent a new owner from charging market-rate rents to existing residents as long as they remain in their current apartments, an owner could in many cases have the unit deregulated when the current tenants die or move. Over the next decade or so, the best-known bastion of middle-class housing in Manhattan could become largely unaffordable to the middle class. Were losing more at one end than were gaining in affordable housing at the other end through the mayors plan, said Victor Bach, a senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society, an organization that studies and tries to alleviate poverty in the city. This just tips the balance even worse. Its more difficult to make the argument that the efforts of the city in affordable housing, which deserve a lot of praise, are going to compensate for the market losses that occur through sales. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has vowed to create and preserve 165,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2013; administration officials say they have produced more than 17,000 units in the last fiscal year alone. But housing experts say thousands of other moderately priced apartments are disappearing from the rent regulation system and from state and city subsidy programs that had kept rents low. The administration has worked to preserve low-priced apartments in older buildings whose owners received government subsidies in return for keeping rents low under programs like the states Mitchell-Lama program. The administration has offered owners incentives to remain in those programs, with some success. But it has less leverage in a strictly private sale like that of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The city and state are not, however, powerless. City officials said they would be willing to work with any buyers who are interested in keeping Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village affordable to the middle class, and could offer incentives. For example, they might help a buyer with getting financing for a co-op conversion plan under which current tenants at certain income levels could buy their apartments at a reduced price. Emily A. Youssouf, president of the citys Housing Development Corporation, which encourages private investment in low- and moderately priced housing through things like low-interest mortgages and the issuance of bonds, said her agency could, for example, use its reserves to make a loan to a buyer that would enable them in turn to offer the apartments to current residents at prices they could afford. From the sellers perspective, they can get the same price, Ms. Youssouf said. As long as they can make as much money, I think thats probably their primary concern. Remember, MetLife built these properties with help from the city. Do they have any obligation to do something like this? I think the answer is no. But as long as they can still make a good return on it, why would they not want to do it? Two years ago, the city helped persuade the owner of West Village Houses, a 420-unit apartment complex that had become eligible to leave the Mitchell-Lama program and begin charging market-rate rents, to convert the complex to a co-op and sell the apartments to the tenants at a discount rate. As part of the agreement, the administration agreed to forgive $19 million of interest accrued on a city mortgage loan and to recommend a tax exemption for 12 years. Earlier this year, the tenants of two large working-class apartment complexes, Lafayette-Morrison and Lafayette-Boynton, near Soundview Park in the Bronx, said they had arranged for a group of real estate investors to buy the buildings and sell the units to tenants. In that case, the city extended the existing real estate tax abatement on the buildings to help make the deal possible and keep the price of the units low. In another case, the city helped arrange tax breaks and other incentives that enabled CPC Resources Inc., which develops moderately priced housing, to buy Parkchester, a 12,000-unit apartment complex in the Bronx also built by MetLife. Clearly, the potential sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village is of significant concern to the administration and the mayor and we would very much want to work with any potential buyer to preserve affordable housing in these properties, Shaun Donovan, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said yesterday. More Articles in New York Region »With rising housing costs squeezing middle-class New Yorkers and with the Bloomberg administration struggling to slow the loss of homes that people like teachers and nurses can afford, the news that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village could be sold and turned eventually into luxury apartments illustrates vividly the uphill battle the administration and the city are facing.

But many residents wonder how long middle-class families can afford to live there. Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Stuyvesant Town tenant Bobby Medoro, with his 2-year-old son Nicholas. Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Stuyvesant Town tenants Diana Scalera, left, Eric Zanier and Gerald Striker. Nearly three-quarters of the 11,200 apartments in the two complexes, which Metropolitan Life is offering for sale, currently fall under the states rent regulation system and rent for as little as half the open-market rate. But a new owner who pays the $4 billion to $5 billion that MetLife is said to want may have a powerful financial incentive to try to remove many or most of those units from the rent regulation system. While state law would prevent a new owner from charging market-rate rents to existing residents as long as they remain in their current apartments, an owner could in many cases have the unit deregulated when the current tenants die or move. Over the next decade or so, the best-known bastion of middle-class housing in Manhattan could become largely unaffordable to the middle class. Were losing more at one end than were gaining in affordable housing at the other end through the mayors plan, said Victor Bach, a senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society, an organization that studies and tries to alleviate poverty in the city. This just tips the balance even worse. Its more difficult to make the argument that the efforts of the city in affordable housing, which deserve a lot of praise, are going to compensate for the market losses that occur through sales. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has vowed to create and preserve 165,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2013; administration officials say they have produced more than 17,000 units in the last fiscal year alone. But housing experts say thousands of other moderately priced apartments are disappearing from the rent regulation system and from state and city subsidy programs that had kept rents low. The administration has worked to preserve low-priced apartments in older buildings whose owners received government subsidies in return for keeping rents low under programs like the states Mitchell-Lama program. The administration has offered owners incentives to remain in those programs, with some success. But it has less leverage in a strictly private sale like that of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The city and state are not, however, powerless. City officials said they would be willing to work with any buyers who are interested in keeping Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village affordable to the middle class, and could offer incentives. For example, they might help a buyer with getting financing for a co-op conversion plan under which current tenants at certain income levels could buy their apartments at a reduced price. Emily A. Youssouf, president of the citys Housing Development Corporation, which encourages private investment in low- and moderately priced housing through things like low-interest mortgages and the issuance of bonds, said her agency could, for example, use its reserves to make a loan to a buyer that would enable them in turn to offer the apartments to current residents at prices they could afford. From the sellers perspective, they can get the same price, Ms. Youssouf said. As long as they can make as much money, I think thats probably their primary concern. Remember, MetLife built these properties with help from the city. Do they have any obligation to do something like this? I think the answer is no. But as long as they can still make a good return on it, why would they not want to do it? Two years ago, the city helped persuade the owner of West Village Houses, a 420-unit apartment complex that had become eligible to leave the Mitchell-Lama program and begin charging market-rate rents, to convert the complex to a co-op and sell the apartments to the tenants at a discount rate. As part of the agreement, the administration agreed to forgive $19 million of interest accrued on a city mortgage loan and to recommend a tax exemption for 12 years.

The sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, shown in 1947, would transform a complex built for World War II veterans. Multimedia Graphic: The Big Deal With a target price of nearly $5 billion, the sale would be the biggest deal for a single American property in modern times. It would undoubtedly transform what has been an affordable, leafy redoubt for generations of Manhattans middle class: teachers and nurses, firefighters and police officers, office clerks and construction workers. MetLife, one of the largest life insurers in North America, said in July that it might sell the two complexes, which it built nearly 60 years ago with government help. It has hired a broker, who started registering bidders last week for the 80-acre property along First Avenue between 14th and 23rd Streets. Behind the scenes, the sale has already drawn interest from dozens of prospective buyers, including New Yorks top real estate families, pension funds, international investment banks and investors from Dubai, according to real estate executives, even though the marketing book will not be released to bidders until next week. The deal is likely to lead to profound changes for many of the 25,000 residents of the two complexes, where two-thirds of the apartments have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate. Any new owner paying the equivalent of $450,000 per apartment is going to be eager to create a money-making luxury enclave, real estate executives say. The sale would only add to the seismic cultural shifts already under way in New York City and especially in Manhattan, where soaring housing costs have made the borough increasingly inhospitable to working-class and middle-class residents. It would be another challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloombergs effort to stabilize and expand the number of affordable apartments in the city. Its really sad, said Suzanne Wasserman, a historian and filmmaker who has lived in Stuyvesant Town since 1989. New York has always attracted people who arent just interested in money  people interested in culture and poetry and music and dance and those young people who are the creative capital of the city. They arent going to have a place here and probably really dont already. I think it affects everything about city life. Rumors of an impending sale began circulating among residents several years ago when MetLife was in the midst of $300 million in upgrades that included new landscaping and playgrounds, spruced-up fountains, new wiring, air conditioning, carpeting and lights. Rose Associates took over management three years ago. At the same time, MetLife sought to oust tenants not listed on leases. And as rents for more apartments hit the legal threshold of $2,000 a month, MetLife has been able to charge new tenants market rates for those apartments when they became vacant. Under that threshold, the rent stabilization law limits increases to a fixed percentage each year for about a million apartments. About 27 percent of the tenants at Peter Cooper and Stuyvesant Town are now exempt from it and pay market rents. But most, like Marilyn Phillips, 52, a nurse who has lived in Stuyvesant Town for 14 years, pay stabilized rents. She and her husband, a social worker, pay $1,700 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. News of the sale worried her. It may mean we may no longer be able to live here, she said. The management is intent on making this luxury apartments and driving the working class out. MetLife and real estate investors view the sale far differently. Itll be the largest sale of a single property in U.S. history, said Dan Fasulo of Real Capital Analytics, a real estate research and consulting firm. No doubt in my mind.

A few silver-haired residents, some with walkers, chatted on park benches, while others read large-print novels. But the scene at Peter Cooper, a 21-building housing complex on First Avenue between 20th and 23rd Streets, represents the aftermath of a hard-fought two-year conflict over the landlords plan to replace building keys with electronic key cards bearing tenants photographs. The legal fight came to an end last month when a State Supreme Court justice ruled that the landlord, MetLife, could require use of the key cards. Tenants of seven Peter Cooper buildings were recently told that their metal keys would no longer work after Sept. 12, with the other buildings soon to follow. But the hostilities are not over  they have moved to a different, and bigger, arena. City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, who lives in Peter Cooper Village and like some other tenants criticizes the key-card system as an invasion of privacy, introduced a bill in June to, among other things, require landlords using such systems to purge the accumulated data every 30 days. Our view is that you shouldnt have to disclose to your landlord who your friends are and whos watering your plants, Mr. Garodnick said. Theres clearly a movement to make entry systems electronic. What Im trying to do is make some reasonable limitation on the data that comes out of those systems. Mr. Garodnick, who has 31 co-sponsors for his bill in the 51-member Council, hopes that a hearing on it will be held this fall. At least 10 housing complexes in the city, including Waterside Plaza, on the East River south of 30th Street, have begun using electronic key cards. The Peter Cooper system not only compels tenants to be photographed and can record when they enter their building, it also requires tenants who want extra cards for guests to have those visitors photographed. Some tenants say it gives too much personal information to the landlord and may be intended to root out illegal subtenants. The passions among some are still pretty high, said Alvin Doyle, president of the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association. John Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, declined to comment beyond saying that the company was considering selling the complex. MetLife has said the cards are essential for ensuring security. Last Tuesday evening, with their local battle lost, many residents at Peter Cooper Village were resigned to the forthcoming deadline. And some had no objection to the new system. I think its a good security measure, said John Tobias, a retired chemistry professor, who was reading on a shady bench. I have nothing to hide. More Articles in New York Region »THE placid lawns of Peter Cooper Village did not look much like a battlefield last week.

The one that turns up in sentences like "I'll get a new car if  and that's a big if  I get a raise"? Now, a leading marketer of life insurance is using a colossal-size version of the conditional. The campaign, now getting under way, is for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, known as MetLife, one of the largest American life insurers. Besides television and newspapers, the campaign will extend to the Internet (metlife.com), cartoons and sweepstakes  not to mention onto the sides of the two MetLife blimps, Snoopy I and Snoopy II, that criss-cross the country. The effort is the latest in a barrage from marketers of all types of insurance, which includes new ads from Genworth Financial, Liberty Mutual and Travelers as well as continuing promotions from Aflac, Allstate, Geico and State Farm. MetLife has a budget estimated at more than $30 million, an increase from the estimated $22 million spent on other recent campaigns. Foote Cone &amp; Belding in New York, one of the two principal MetLife agencies, is creating the campaign. The ads are the first change in themes for Met Life in six years. The previous theme, "Have You Met Life Today," still appears, but only tucked into corners of ads, not unlike some vestigial organ. The new theme is "Guarantees for the If in Life," which is being abbreviated on the sides of the blimps as "For the If in Life"  presumably because the word "Guarantees" is long enough to require a blimp or two of its own. Beth Hirschhorn, chief marketing officer at MetLife in New York, said the theme was intended to address an important change in the market for life and health insurance that was uncovered by consumer research. "Pretty much at the heart of this campaign is that Americans are feeling a greater financial burden on themselves," Ms. Hirschhorn said. "Even when the 'macro' indicators don't look too bad, consumers are feeling worse than they have been." The reason is that "they are very aware of the erosion of traditional safety nets," she said. "They know they can't rely in retirement on government, employers or the stock market the way they used to.""MetLife is playing the part of a partner to help people create their own personal safety nets." That argument is made pointedly in the initial elements of the campaign. "Let's bring today's financial uncertainties down to size," says the headline of one ad. The headline of another ad says reassuringly, "Replace today's uncertainties with guarantees." The narrator in the first television commercial, which runs 60 seconds, declares: "If. For such a small word, it packs a wallop. We all have our personal ifs." Among them, she says, is wondering "if Social Security isn't enough" for a retirement nest egg. " 'If' can hold you back," the narrator asserts, then pivots in a positive direction, adding: "Or 'if' can propel you forward. We believe 'if' should never hold you back." Thomas Ordahl, a partner at Group 1066 in New York, a corporate identity consulting company, said the focus on uncertainty made sense. "The insurance industry was built on the promise of mitigating the risks in life, although in the past it was mostly the everyday, ordinary risks of death, house burning down, being laid up in the hospital for months," Mr. Ordahl said. "This campaign targets more abstract modern fears: being laid off, taking care of older parents, living to 100," he added. "What was the promise of protecting you from life's catastrophes has now becoming protecting you from life's anxieties." In other words, Mr. Ordahl said, "postmodernism hits the insurance industry." Foote Cone, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, shares the MetLife agency roster with Y&amp;R Advertising in New York, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam Brands unit of the WPP Group. Y&amp;R Advertising typically creates campaigns aimed at consumers and Foote Cone typically creates business-to-business campaigns, centered on employee benefits. The Foote Cone interactive unit, FCBi, works on Web sites for MetLife and the MetLife Bank. (metlifebank.com). "We're close to this issue because on employee benefits, consumers ask, 'What can I expect from my employer?' " after retiring, said Kim Corrigan, executive vice president and director for client services at Foote Cone. The campaign is not only aimed at baby boomers who are nearing retirement, Ms. Corrigan said, but also is "casting a much wider net" to reach "the younger generation that knows they don't have the safety net and can't count on others for the future." Bringing up the ifs in life, as in the daunting risks, could be counterproductive for MetLife because it may stimulate fear in consumers that leads to inertia rather than action, like learning more about MetLife policies and products. To address that, Ms. Corrigan said, the campaign takes the approach that "there will always be an 'if' in 'life,' some wonderful, some challenging, and in today's world, managing the 'ifs' in life is more important than ever." "It's not to say Met Life is going to solve every if," she added, but by working with customers to design their safety nets, "the value proposition is that Met Life is helping you manage through the uncertainties with guarantees." Snoopy and Woodstock, the Peanuts characters that have appeared in MetLife ads for decades, are part of the new campaign. For instance, Snoopy, dressed as his alter ego, the World War I flying ace who chases the Red Baron over the skies of Europe, appears on the blimps. Another Peanuts connection is made in the television commercials, which use a new orchestral arrangement of "Linus and Lucy," music written by Vince Guaraldi for the 1965 animated TV show "A Charlie Brown Christmas." In addition to consumers getting a look at the campaign on television, in newspapers and online, "there is an internal component" for MetLife employees, Ms. Hirschhorn said, meant to inform them about and build their enthusiasm for the new approach. Among the elements still to come, she added, are the cartoons, which will appear as ads in The New Yorker magazine; ads aimed at Congress and so-called thought leaders, which will run in publications like The Hill, Roll Call and The Washington Post; and promotions like contests and sweepstakes.

"What was the promise of protecting you from life's catastrophes has now becoming protecting you from life's anxieties." In other words, Mr. Ordahl said, "postmodernism hits the insurance industry." Foote Cone, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, shares the MetLife agency roster with Y&amp;R Advertising in New York, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam Brands unit of the WPP Group. Y&amp;R Advertising typically creates campaigns aimed at consumers and Foote Cone typically creates business-to-business campaigns, centered on employee benefits. The Foote Cone interactive unit, FCBi, works on Web sites for MetLife and the MetLife Bank. (metlifebank.com). "We're close to this issue because on employee benefits, consumers ask, 'What can I expect from my employer?' " after retiring, said Kim Corrigan, executive vice president and director for client services at Foote Cone. The campaign is not only aimed at baby boomers who are nearing retirement, Ms. Corrigan said, but also is "casting a much wider net" to reach "the younger generation that knows they don't have the safety net and can't count on others for the future." Bringing up the ifs in life, as in the daunting risks, could be counterproductive for MetLife because it may stimulate fear in consumers that leads to inertia rather than action, like learning more about MetLife policies and products. To address that, Ms. Corrigan said, the campaign takes the approach that "there will always be an 'if' in 'life,' some wonderful, some challenging, and in today's world, managing the 'ifs' in life is more important than ever." "It's not to say Met Life is going to solve every if," she added, but by working with customers to design their safety nets, "the value proposition is that Met Life is helping you manage through the uncertainties with guarantees." Snoopy and Woodstock, the Peanuts characters that have appeared in MetLife ads for decades, are part of the new campaign. For instance, Snoopy, dressed as his alter ego, the World War I flying ace who chases the Red Baron over the skies of Europe, appears on the blimps. Another Peanuts connection is made in the television commercials, which use a new orchestral arrangement of "Linus and Lucy," music written by Vince Guaraldi for the 1965 animated TV show "A Charlie Brown Christmas." In addition to consumers getting a look at the campaign on television, in newspapers and online, "there is an internal component" for MetLife employees, Ms. Hirschhorn said, meant to inform them about and build their enthusiasm for the new approach. Among the elements still to come, she added, are the cartoons, which will appear as ads in The New Yorker magazine; ads aimed at Congress and so-called thought leaders, which will run in publications like The Hill, Roll Call and The Washington Post; and promotions like contests and sweepstakes.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E3D71230F931A35757C0A9609C8B63&amp;ref=metlifeinc">Discrimination, Then and Now<date>Published: April 2, 2006</date><text>To the Editor: I was quite interested to read ''Battle in Black and White,'' by Amy Fox (March 26), about the discrimination against blacks at Stuyvesant Town that existed in the 1950's and the fight to abolish it. Stuyvesant Town (and its sister and contiguous development, Peter Cooper Village) were and still are owned by Metropolitan Life Insurance. At that time, MetLife was merely following the attitudes that were widely practiced at that time -- in housing and employment -- by almost all in the private sector. Stuyvesant Town no longer practices racial discrimination. But it does follow a current selfish trend: greed. As Ms. Fox pointed out, five years ago MetLife began converting vacant apartments to so-called luxury apartments with a subsequent increase in rental charges to over $4,000. (The median rent five years ago was about $1,000.) So, from blatant racial discrimination 50 years ago to closing middle-income housing to the very people it was intended to house, it now practices a different type of malevolence. David S.

It was a testimonial of how far we have come and how far we still need to go. In 1952 MetLife followed a policy of segregation that was institutionalized nationwide. The apartments are now open to all. Some of the longtime residents are resentful of newcomers, especially of minority background, and are acting in a manner that would be better fitted to the 50's. During the 2004 presidential elections, I was questioned by a longtime resident as to my eligibility to vote, while my companion, who is white and had the same documentation, was not harassed. When coming into the building, with key in hand, I have been stopped by longtime residents and asked if I live in the building. Some have stopped me and asked if I work in the building, and look surprised when I inform them that I live there. It's time for the longtime residents to treat their new neighbors, minority or otherwise, with respect, kindness and dignity.

John J. Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, said Tuesday that 600 of the 1,800 Travelers Life positions in Hartford would be eliminated, while 100 other employees would be offered the chance to relocate. Mr. Calagna said that 150 jobs would be cut as soon as the deal was consummated, with the remaining 450 eliminated within 6 to 12 months after the merger. Mr. Calagna said that he expected the deal to be completed this summer, after state and foreign regulatory approvals, and that the Travelers employees in Hartford had been told of their status by MetLife. In a statement issued Wednesday, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said he would oppose the $11.5 billion acquisition because it is ''against the public interest.'' He said he would intervene in the approval proceedings by the state's Department of Insurance. ''It will destroy our economy and disadvantage families,'' Mr. Blumenthal said in the statement, referring to the acquisition. ''My message to MetLife is: Keep jobs in Hartford, or keep your hands off Travelers. ''MetLife is welcome to expand its presence in Connecticut, as long as it fulfills its public interest obligations to Travelers' employees, Hartford and the state.'' Rich Harris, a spokesman for Gov. M. Jodi Rell, said that the governor and her staff had been meeting with MetLife officials to try to save jobs since the deal was announced in late January. ''I think we had some success,'' he said. ''But the governor is still not happy with the numbers as they are now.''</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7DF1E3EF935A25757C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; METLIFE AGREES TO SCALE BACK LAYOFFS<date>Published: April 16, 2005</date><text>MetLife said yesterday that it would scale back job cuts in Hartford, related to its acquisition of Travelers Life and Annuity, for at least a year. The announcement prompted Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, to drop his threat to fight the merger. MetLife said earlier this week that it would eliminate 600 jobs and move 100 more. Yesterday, the company said the cuts would amount to 390, with 100 jobs to be relocated. Over all, 1,310 of 1,800 jobs will remain in Hartford for at least one year beginning July 1, when the deal is expected to close. John Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, would not speculate what might occur in a year. Mr. Blumenthal said he would abandon his intent to intervene, but would ''closely monitor the acquisition and approval process.''</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/14/business/14metlife.html?ref=metlifeinc">Connecticut Official Seeking to Halt MetLife Deal<date>Published: April 14, 2005</date><text>he Connecticut attorney general said yesterday that he would seek to block the planned takeover of the Travelers Life and Annuity Company by MetLife, citing layoffs that the deal would cause. The official, Richard Blumenthal, said he would ask the Connecticut state insurance regulator to deny approval for the takeover in light of MetLife's plan to eliminate hundreds of Hartford-based jobs at Travelers - by some estimates, about 40 percent of the company's work force. Although Mr. Blumenthal does not have the authority to stop the acquisition, he is arguing that it is not in the public interest. MetLife, based in New York, said in January that it expected the $11.5 billion purchase of Travelers Life and Annuity, also based in New York, from Citigroup to close around July 1, after receipt of the required approvals from insurance regulators, including those in Connecticut and New York. Citigroup bought the Travelers Group, a big insurer, in 1998. Since then, as hoped-for profits failed to materialize, Citigroup has been shedding or spinning off the various insurance operations of Travelers to concentrate on its core banking and finance operations. In a statement yesterday, Mr. Blumenthal said that "MetLife's layoffs could devastate the economy of Hartford and the region by eliminating hundreds of much-needed, high-paying, skilled jobs." A spokesman for MetLife, John Calagna, said that "we do feel confident that the transaction meets the requirements and that it will be approved by the regulators." A Travelers spokeswoman, Leah Johnson, said, "We believe that MetLife will be able to resolve this matter." She declined to elaborate. Mr. Blumenthal is conducting a broad investigation into the insurance industry, amid a larger inquiry being carried out by the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. The Connecticut Insurance Department is expected within a couple of weeks to set a date for hearings on the proposed MetLife takeover. Such hearings are often routine. Still, Mr. Blumenthal's opposition is the first time that he has opposed an insurance-related deal in the state. Connecticut is home to many insurers. In deciding whether to approve a merger, state insurance regulators seek evidence that the deal is financially sound, protects policyholders, does not hinder competition and is in the "public interest." A spokeswoman for the agency, Kate Kiernan-Pagani, said yesterday that to her knowledge, the agency had never denied a merger application because of concern over job losses. MetLife said on Monday that it would eliminate 600 jobs at Travelers Life and Annuity as a result of the takeover, but Mr. Blumenthal's office thinks that the total will be more than 700, a spokeswoman said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/02/nyregion/02metlife.html?ref=metlifeinc">MetLife Sells Second Tower in a Week<date>Published: April 2, 2005</date><text>he MetLife Building, a signature skyscraper on the Manhattan skyline and the glittering gateway to Park Avenue above Grand Central Terminal, has been sold for a record $1.72 billion, it was announced yesterday. It was the second major real estate deal this week for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which announced on Wednesday that its landmark property, 1 Madison Avenue, would be sold for $918 million for a condominium project. Advertisement Of the two skyscrapers, the one at 200 Park Avenue - known for much of its history as the Pan Am Building - is the more famous. With 2.8 million square feet, it was once the largest commercial office building in the world. In countless television shows and films, from "The Jeffersons" to "Godzilla," the panorama shot of Park Avenue begins with the 58-story tower. The principal buyer is Tishman Speyer Properties, which also owns the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center. It heads a joint venture that includes the New York City Employees' Retirement System and the Teachers' Retirement System. The deal is scheduled to close in early May. The previous record for the sale of a skyscraper in the United States was in 2003 when the developer Harry Macklowe paid $1.4 billion for the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets. MetLife said it would keep its boardroom and headquarters there, and that the familiar MetLife logo would stay. In a telephone interview, Rob Speyer, 35, a Tishman Speyer senior managing director, sounded almost giddy about the deal. "Think about it," he said. "It's the opportunity of a lifetime. To buy one of New York City's iconic properties is an opportunity we just leapt at." Steven Wechsler, 55, also a Tishman Speyer senior managing director, said in the same telephone interview that he was especially thrilled because he once lived on Park Avenue. "In New York City, the greatest place in the world, to walk by the assets that we now have is really, really a thrill," he said. For MetLife's part, the transaction capped a thrilling week in another sense: the sale of two real estate assets for more than $2.6 billion. In the Park Avenue deal, "we'll probably clear about $750 million," said John Calagna, a MetLife spokesman, in a cellphone interview. "Sorry to shout. I'm actually in Grand Central just below the MetLife Building right now." The latest sale is unlike the Madison Avenue deal, in which the new buyer plans to convert much of the building to apartments. Tishman Speyer said the Park Avenue property would remain an office building. In January, MetLife said it would buy Citigroup's life insurance business in a deal valued at $11.5 billion, its largest acquisition. "We said then that we would consider funding that transaction by selling real estate assets," Mr. Calagna said. "So now we get to take advantage of a robust real estate market and our name stays on," he said, referring to the MetLife logo. The last time the building was sold was in 1981, when the troubled Pan American Airways sold it to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for $400 million. But the Pan Am logo remained for more than a decade. The building once had a helipad that was the site of one of New York City's deadliest aviation accidents. On May 16, 1977, a New York Airways helicopter idling at the helipad suddenly toppled and its rotor blade sheared off. It sliced four people to death and then fell over the parapet 59 stories below and a block away on Madison Avenue, killing a pedestrian during the evening rush.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/31/nyregion/31metlife.html?ref=metlifeinc">$1 Billion Deal Turns MetLife Into Condos<date>Published: March 31, 2005</date><text>ne Madison Avenue, one of the oldest well-preserved examples of early skyscraper architecture and home for nearly a century to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, is being sold for nearly $1 billion to a company that will convert its 41-story tower, a landmark, into condominiums, executives on both sides of the deal announced yesterday. Advertisement The SL Green Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust that owns several Manhattan properties, said it would pay $918 million for the MetLife complex, at the southeast corner of Madison Square Park at 23rd Street. Besides its ornate north tower, the world's tallest when completed in 1909, the complex includes a far larger south building, which covers an entire blockfront along 23rd Street. That building will remain office space, the company said. The acquisition "provides a steady stream of earnings to come from this trophy asset, along with substantial upside in conversion and development opportunities," said Marc Holliday, SL Green's chief executive. One Madison Avenue covers the block between Madison and Park Avenues and 23d and 24th Streets. The south building has 1.2 million square feet of office space, almost all of it leased through 2020 to Credit Suisse First Boston. Although SL Green has no intention of converting that part of the complex to apartments, Mr. Holliday said, the deal includes air rights over the south building that should enable it to build another tower, next to the 96-year-old north tower, that would house an additional 470,000 square feet of apartments. Real estate industry experts said that the price agreed to by SF Green was high for old Manhattan office space, even in sought-after locations, but that the potential for residential conversion in the north tower, and new construction over the south, raised its value sharply. The deal announced yesterday comes when surging home prices in Manhattan have led to several conversions of office buildings and hotels to apartments, including high-rise buildings on the blocks around Wall Street. Hotels like the Intercontinental Central Park South, the St. Regis and the Plaza have converted guest rooms to apartments or have announced plans to do so. The blockfronts around Madison Square Park, with several of the city's best examples of 19th-century and early-20th-century architecture, have been hotbeds of conversion. Among the park's neighbors being recast as condos are the huge Gift Industry Building and the International Toy Center. "We've got Madison Square surrounded," said Darcy Stacom, executive vice president of CB Richard Ellis, who brokered the deal between MetLife and SF Green. She said the area was particularly appealing to developers because of its stately architecture, an abundance of restaurants and residential amenities and Madison Square Park itself, a long underused green space that has undergone extensive renovation, planting and landscaping. MetLife, which moved the last of its employees out of the complex in 2003, has been looking for a buyer. Whether the wave of residential conversions has run its course remains to be seen, Ms. Stacom said. She said office buildings that fit a financial profile for conversion were in short supply. They should be in or close to residential areas, she said, have smaller floors than many modern corporate buildings and commercial tenants who are willing to leave. In many respects, the north tower of One Madison Avenue has long been a conversion waiting to happen. Its floors are small and command sweeping views of Lower Manhattan. Its ceilings are high at 12 to 17 feet, and its location near Chelsea, the Flatiron district and Greenwich Village is considered choice by most apartment seekers. The exterior of the north tower, familiar to many because of its huge clock dials that face out from the 25th, 26th and 27th floors and its cupola of Italian gold leaf, cannot be altered because of its designation as a national landmark. But Mr. Holliday said that designation would not prevent the use of air rights next door. He said it had not been determined when construction would begin inside the north tower or when its condos would be ready. Nor has it been determined when SL Green would use its air rights to build a new tower, he said. While all the brick, stonework, gold leaf and other architectural detail on the north tower's exterior is protected, another familiar aspect of the building - the multicolored lights that bathe its sides at night - is not.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC123FF93AA15750C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=metlifeinc">Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Tenants File Suit In ID Plan<date>Published: March 29, 2005</date><text>Residents of a Manhattan apartment complex went to court yesterday to stop their landlord, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, from requiring that they be photographed for electronic card keys to their apartment buildings.

Anthony S. Serra, a former supervisor of the Rikers Island jail complex, pleaded guilty this month to state and federal charges that included tax evasion and using correction officers to do work on his home in Mahopac, in Putnam County, while they were on city time. He faces a sentence of up to a year on the state charges and up to five years on the federal charge. Investigators with the city Department of Investigation and the Bronx district attorney's office found that Mr. Serra had his subordinates renovate the kitchen and a bathroom at his home on Rustic Road. Investigators also said he had the workers install stereo speakers, a pool deck and a basketball court, and do many hours of yard work. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com Mr. Serra bought the newly built house from a developer in 1997 for $225,000, according to information filed with the New York State Office of Real Property Services. It turned out to be a good investment. After all the illicit work on the home, he put it on the market and last year found a buyer who paid $590,000, according to the assessor's office of the town of Carmel, which includes Mahopac. Details of the home sale were first reported in The Chief, the weekly Civil Service newspaper. Sal Alfano, the editorial director of Remodeling, a trade magazine for construction professionals, said that he wasn't familiar with the local market in Mahopac, but that kitchen and bathroom renovations are among the most lucrative in terms of adding value to a property. "When you have a newly remodeled kitchen and bath, you're playing right into the hand of prospective buyers who are attracted to the flash of those rooms," Mr. Alfano said. Remodeling compiles an annual list that compares construction costs with resale values for many home-improvement projects, and he said that kitchen and bathroom renovations are regularly in the top five. And it doesn't hurt that in Mr. Serra's case the labor came free - at least for a time. Mr. Alfano said that in general, labor accounts for about 25 to 30 percent of renovation costs. As part of his guilty plea, Mr. Serra was ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution to the city. Mr. Alfano said that decks are popular and can add to home values, but that a basketball court may not be something that would recoup its costs under normal circumstances. Mr. Serra, 44, who has since moved to Florida, was a paid consultant to Gov. George E. Pataki's 2002 re-election campaign. He was indicted in 2003. He also pleaded guilty this month to a charge related to the use of correction workers on the campaign and to a tax charge stemming from his income as a campaign consultant. He faces up to a year in prison on the state charges and up to five years in prison for the tax conviction. He was ordered to pay the restitution and could be made to pay up to $250,000 in additional fines. He will be sentenced on the state charges in July. A federal sentencing has not yet been scheduled. MetLife Condos? The former MetLife headquarters at Madison Square Park may be transformed into luxury condos. Bids were due Friday for One Madison Avenue, a landmark building opposite Madison Square Park that MetLife occupied until 2003. The insurance company has been marketing the building's picturesque clock tower as a prime candidate for conversion to apartments. The gilded, peaked MetLife tower is one of the most recognizable sights in Manhattan and, according to a package provided to potential buyers, it has room for about 100 apartments. CB Richard Ellis is the broker. The tower, which has 41 floors but reaches to about 50 stories at the top of its spire, was built in 1909 at the corner of 24th Street and Madison Avenue. An adjacent 16-story office building was erected in stages, from 1954 to 1960, filling the rest of the block from 23rd to 24th Street and Madison to Park Avenue. The entire complex is for sale, but only the tower is being pitched as a residential gold mine. Credit Suisse First Boston has a lease through 2020 on most of the office space in the newer building. One developer who has seen the property predicted it could sell for more than $800 million.

Advertisement The cards, which have become common in Manhattan hotels and office buildings, are described by MetLife as essential to ensuring security at the 2,480-unit apartment complex. But many residents of the complex, on First Avenue between 20th and 23rd Streets - built by MetLife immediately after World War II in a utopian vision of clean, well-kept housing for returning servicemen who might otherwise flee to the suburbs - said yesterday that the landlord's demand crossed the line into an invasion of tenants' privacy. And it has not been lost on either side that the system would make it easier to identify and remove people who illegally sublet apartments, since only those who can show they have a valid lease or are screened by security would qualify for entry. MetLife also owns Stuyvesant Town, a larger 8,750-unit complex just to the south of Peter Cooper Village, and the company acknowledged yesterday that a similar technology could be used there. A March 30 deadline has been set for Peter Cooper Village residents to get the new cards, or potentially be locked out. As in most New York City landlord-tenant disagreements, this one has generated an intense level of vitriol. "This is not security, it is surveillance," said Steven Sanders, a state assemblyman who lives at Peter Cooper Village. "It smacks of totalitarian police state tactics." Assemblyman Sanders said in a news release that a rent strike, threatened by the complex's tenant association to begin in April unless MetLife retreats from its demand, would be one of the largest in city history. Richard Shea, a spokesman for MetLife, said yesterday that the key-card system was a part of "a whole system of security enhancements that are intended the maintain a level of safety," and that the company had no intention of invading tenants' privacy or preventing the friends or families from entering the complex. Although electronic entry cards have made small inroads into New York City apartment buildings - residents of the huge Manhattan Plaza on West 43rd Street have used them for years - experts say none have imposed the technology proposed for Peter Cooper Village. Under the MetLife plan, each key card would bear a photograph, taken by building security, of the authorized cardholder. Duplicate cards for family members, accepted frequent visitors or others could be obtained only with management's permission. The dispute could have broader implications for tenants and landlords across the city, according to real estate executives, because of the technological advantages the electronic entry provides building owners. "It is a big investment that probably only would make sense in large Manhattan buildings," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a property owners group. He said that several recently completed towers in Manhattan had been equipped with key-card systems, but that the technology had not become widespread. "It does make sense to building owners as a way of keeping track of who is coming and going," Mr. Strasburg said. "I would think that the comfort level will improve among tenants and building owners, and it will catch on." But that comfort level is rare among the tenants of Peter Cooper Village, where tenant-landlord relations were long considered a model of cooperation, but are now badly frayed. "We used to refer to MetLife as 'Mother Met,' " said Al Doyle, president of the Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village tenants' association. "Our landlord was considered very benevolent, very fair, but that is certainly not true anymore."

MetLife, like other insurers, has previously received subpoenas from the attorneys general in New York and Connecticut in a wide-ranging investigation into bid-rigging and the compensation that insurers pay to insurance brokers. MetLife, which is based in New York, has said it is cooperating with the investigation, but added that a continuing internal review has not turned up any evidence of fictitious bids.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/01/business/01insure.html?ref=metlifeinc">MetLife to Buy Insurance Unit From Citigroup<date>Published: February 1, 2005</date><text>etLife said yesterday that it would buy Citigroup's life insurance business in a deal valued at $11.5 billion, a move that strengthens its position as one of the largest companies in an industry that is continuing to consolidate. In its largest acquisition, MetLife will pay $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion in cash for Citigroup's life and annuity division and nearly all of its international insurance operations. The rest of the purchase will be in MetLife stock. Advertisement The deal, which is expected to be completed this summer, will make MetLife the largest provider of life insurance for individuals in North America based on sales, moving up from eighth and passing rivals like Northwestern Mutual, A.I.G. and New York Life. It will also become the third-largest underwriter of individual annuities based on sales and the largest retirement and savings plan provider in the United States. For Citigroup, the sale will result in an immediate $2 billion gain and remove from its balance sheet a slower-growing business that offers neither the glamour nor the lucrative returns of investment banking. It is also an acknowledgment that the vision of Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup, of a financial services supermarket - combining insurance underwriting with lending and commercial banking - has not worked out as expected. Richard X. Bove, a banking analyst with Punk, Zeigel &amp; Company in New York, who has been critical of Citigroup, said he thought the move showed clearly that the idea of putting life insurance providers together with banks "was not a realistic or good one." With the exception of Bank One buying part of Zurich Financial Services' American life insurance unit in May 2003, he said, no other major bank has moved into the business since laws separating insurance underwriting from commercial banking were repealed in 1999. Now, even Citigroup, which lobbied harder than anyone to tear down those regulatory walls, is getting out. "If you go back to the days when insurers and banks were at each other's throats to generate changes in laws, it's almost humorous now," Mr. Bove added. "What we have learned over the past five years is banks can sell insurance but they shouldn't be underwriting it." After completing his purchase of the Travelers insurance group in 1993, Mr. Weill acquired the Shearson and Salomon brokerage firms before merging them with Citicorp in 1998 to form Citigroup. But under his watch, Citigroup has slowly dismantled the Travelers division. In 1995, Travelers sold a health care and insurance joint venture with MetLife to the UnitedHealth Group. Seven years later, it spun off its property and casualty unit in an initial offering to create Travelers Property Casualty Corporation. But through it all, Citigroup's life insurance business persevered under the umbrella of Travelers. The sale of Travelers was the culmination of a two-year effort by MetLife, according to several individuals close to the deal. A little more than a year ago, the chairman and chief executive of MetLife, Robert H. Benmosche, initiated talks with the Citigroup chief executive, Charles O. Prince, to explore buying its life insurance division. His first effort was rebuffed, these people said. Despite generating lower returns than the banking division, Mr. Prince at the time was unsure he wanted to sell. But over the last year, Mr. Prince changed his outlook, and shortly before Christmas, he approached Mr. Benmosche, people close to the deal said. The two men spoke several times this month as talks accelerated, and despite the consideration of other buyers, the two men reached a deal. "Both sides are mindful of the competitive environment and I think the price is a fair one as result of that," Mr. Prince said in a conference call with analysts. As part of the deal, MetLife will have access to Citigroup's extensive sales network for 10 years. MetLife's shares fell 19 cents, to $39.75, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday; Citigroup shares rose 67 cents to $49.05. MetLife said that the acquisition should add to its profit almost immediately, increasing its earnings per share 4 percent to 6 percent in 2006. The company also expects to achieve annual savings of at least $150 million from more efficient product management and sales support once the two companies combine. "When you take the MetLife brand, the SmithBarney funds, and the kind of service we are going to provide and technology we are going to bring, we believe this will enhance the whole thing," Mr. Benmosche said in a conference call with analysts. Andrew Kligerman, an insurance industry analyst for UBS, said the acquisition "strengthens an already dominant position for MetLife in the United States and opens the way for more growth overseas." MetLife expects the deal to allow it to expand product lines and the number of countries it serves. The company will gain access to all of Citigroup's international insurance operations other than those in Mexico, where its Travelers insurance division is integrated with its BanaMex bank. Besides relying on cash, MetLife said it planned to finance the purchase through the sale of $1.5 billion to $3 billion in debt and the issuance of $5 billion in new securities that will be convertible to debt. The company is also considering the sale of as much as $3 billion in assets, including unspecified real estate and its 52 percent stake in the Reinsurance Group of America. Mr. Prince said yesterday that the proceeds would be used to fund investments that offer higher returns and growth opportunities. He declined to say specifically how they would be redeployed, but he suggested several options, like making new acquisitions, buying back more stock, paying down debt or raising Citigroup's dividend. MetLife's financial advisers were Banc of America Securities and Goldman Sachs. Citigroup was advised by its global markets division. Joseph B.

The price was $60 million, less than half of what the insurer paid for the property more than 15 years ago. MetLife tried unsuccessfully to sell the site two and a half years ago, when one of the buildings was largely vacant. The buyer is Heyman Properties of Westport, Conn., making its first acquisition of office space in Westchester County. The foray by Heyman into White Plains is seen by many as confirming a more significant role for the city in the suburban office market around Manhattan. ''White Plains is a percolating market these days,'' said Adam Popper, chief financial officer for Heyman Properties, which owns about 4.3 million square feet of commercial space in the northeastern United States, including hotels, shopping centers and office buildings. ''The city has the right demographics, a pro-real-estate and pro-business government, and a strong retail base,'' Mr. Popper said. ''All that coupled with a major surge of rental and condominium development begins to feel like the right elements for success.'' In Westchester, Heyman's only other holding is the Crossroads Shopping Center in Greenburgh, which it owns jointly with Acadia Realty. In addition to the two 15-story buildings at White Plains Plaza -- 445 Hamilton Avenue and One North Broadway -- the complex includes a large stone courtyard, with steps leading down to Main Street, where intense retail and residential development is taking place. The Hamilton Avenue building, which does not have an entrance on Main Street, was the headquarters of Prodigy Services, the online pioneer, for about a decade, until the company moved out during the 1990's. It remained mostly vacant until last year, when the building was upgraded and new tenants began moving in. Next door to the complex and facing Main Street, a building occupied by Sears Roebuck for 37 years is being renovated for Wal-Mart, which expects to move in within a year. Ivy Equities of Montvale, N.J., and Barrow Street Capital, a pension fund adviser in New York, took over Sears's lease in the spring of 2003. In a 66-year leasehold agreement for $13.75 million, the investors gained use of the building and an adjoining six-floor parking garage, both owned by MetLife. Diagonally across Main Street from White Plains Plaza, the developer Louis Cappelli has built a sprawling retail, residential and entertainment complex, including a condominium tower that he is developing with Donald J. Trump. A block away, Mr. Cappelli has broken ground on another complex with more luxury residences and a hotel. The office vacancy rate for the city's central business district at the end of 2004 dropped to 14.9 percent, from 18.7 percent a year earlier, according to figures from Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate services company. Commercial real estate agents attributed the uptick in office rentals to the confluence of new people moving into city apartments and condos, and the new retail activity. The current economic upswing follows a fallow period in the 1990's, when several large corporations downsized or moved away and the office vacancy rate soared above 20 percent. MetLife acquired White Plains Plaza in 1989 for a reported $125 million, just before the commercial real estate market toppled and the city entered a slump, said Glenn P. Walsh, a senior director for Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which represented MetLife in the recent sale. After Prodigy moved out, 445 Hamilton Avenue remained mostly empty, with the insurer occupying only a small portion of it. When MetLife tried to market the property two and a half years ago, ''the offers came in so low that they withdrew it from the market,'' he said. That building is now about three-fourths occupied, and the building on North Broadway, which has a restaurant on the first floor and a health club on the second, has been close to fully occupied over the years.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E0D61530F93BA25751C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; METLIFE UNIT RECEIVES A NOTICE FROM S.E.C.<date>Published: December 18, 2004</date><text>MetLife, the insurer, said yesterday that one of its subsidiaries had received a notice that the Securities and Exchange Commission was considering filing civil charges against it.

Advertisement The insurance commissioner, John Garamendi, said he would still file suit against the broker, Universal Life Resources, and the insurance companies - MetLife, Prudential Financial, the Cigna Corporation and UnumProvident - in San Diego today. But at the same time, he said, his office would seek to make formal the agreement with the broker. A lawyer in San Francisco for Universal Life Resources, Ray Wong, said last night, "We will continue to be working with the Department of Insurance and fully cooperating with them.'' Universal Life, he said, did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. In a copy of the lawsuit, Mr. Garamendi accuses Universal Life Resources, a broker specializing in employee benefits, of receiving kickbacks from the insurance companies in exchange for steering to the insurers the business of corporations seeking group life, disability and other coverages. The kickbacks, the lawsuit says, led to higher insurance costs for the corporations and their workers. The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, filed a similar lawsuit against Universal Life Resources on Friday. In his suit, Mr. Spitzer said some of the same insurance companies paid incentives to encourage the broker to send them business.Mr. Spitzer did not sue any of the insurance companies. All of the insurers declined to comment on the California case. "This case is important,'' Mr. Garamendi said, "because it is the first definitive regulatory action against steering and secret commissions that are harmful to consumers and employees.'' He said Universal Life Resources and the insurance companies engaged in "illegal and unethical practices'' that "only benefit brokers and insurance companies at the expense of American businesses and American citizens.'' Mr. Garamendi began investigating the operations of brokers and insurance companies last spring at about the same time as Mr. Spitzer. In mid-October, Mr. Spitzer filed a suit accusing Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, a New York company that is the world's largest insurance broker, of bid-rigging and steering corporate customers to the highest-paying insurance companies. Mr. Spitzer has also brought criminal charges against executives at Ace Ltd., a Bermuda insurer, and the American International Group, one of the largest insurers. Attorneys general and insurance regulators in several states have also begun investigations. On Tuesday, Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald of Illinois, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee on governmental affairs, conducted the first of what is expected to be a series of Congressional hearings. Mr. Garamendi said he did not try to settle with the insurers. Universal Life Resources, he said, was "the key player in this process.'' "U.L.R. was the privot or hub,'' he said, "around which this activity took place.'' In a statement, David Gabianelli, another lawyer for Universal Life Resources, said it was "pleased that the California Department of Insurance has chosen to work with the firm to reach agreement on how U.L.R. does business.'' Mr. Gabianelli added that Universal Life was "committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the industry.'' In addition to the suit filed by Mr. Spitzer, the firm of Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman &amp; Robbins brought a case last month on behalf of an Intel employee. The lawsuit contended that Universal Life and several insurance companies "conspired to extract undisclosed compensation and fees from employers and employees who purchase insurance policies offered through the employee-benefit plans.'' Several weeks ago, Mr. Garamendi hired the Lerach firm to prepare the lawsuit he is filing today. He said he expected that the broker and the insurance companies would pay restitution as a result of the other lawsuits.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/13/business/13insure.html?ref=metlifeinc">Spitzer Sues Broker Used for Workplace Insurance<date>Published: November 13, 2004</date><text>he New York attorney general's investigation into abuses in the insurance industry escalated yesterday with a lawsuit accusing a California broker of fraudulent practices that led to higher premiums for employees at some of the nation's leading companies. The attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, sued Universal Life Resources, accusing the firm of steering business to insurers like MetLife, Prudential and Unum Provident in exchange for millions of dollars in payments, which, until 2003, were not properly disclosed. The insurance coverage was bought for employees of companies like Viacom and Intel. The complaint also contends that Universal Life inflated certain fees relating to benefit enrollment materials, ultimately passing that cost onto the client's employees. Advertisement Mr. Spitzer's lawsuit against Universal Life is the second against an insurance broker since his investigation of the industry began last spring. The investigation's focus has been on bid-rigging by brokers of commercial insurance, resulting in a lawsuit against Marsh &amp; McLennan, the biggest insurance broker, on Oct. 14. Like Marsh, Universal Life is another influential middleman, but in the area of employee benefits: the life, disability and accident insurance a company obtains for its workers. While the earlier lawsuit portrayed corporations as the victims, investigators said the latest action directly affected individuals. "This case brings the insurance industry fraud that we have uncovered to the ordinary consumer, where monthly premiums have been inflated by the gamesmanship and illegal conduct of U.L.R. and the carriers," Mr. Spitzer said yesterday. "This conspiracy to defeat competition and push business not to the lowest-cost provider but to the company willing to make a payoff is destroying competition." A lawyer for Universal Life, Bob Cleary of the firm of Proskauer Rose, declined to comment other than to say that the attorney general's office had not sent him a copy of the complaint. Universal Life, based in San Diego, is a small but powerful company with only about 80 employees. Since 1994, the closely held company has acted as an insurance broker to more than four million employees of big American corporations. Mr. Spitzer's suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, also names the firm's founder and chief executive, Douglas P. Cox, saying that he "completely controls U.L.R.'' "He personally authorizes all of U.L.R.'s important business decisions, including those alleged in this complaint." The suit also accuses Mr. Cox of treating Universal Life and two affiliated companies also named in the suit as "personal instrumentalities, exercising sole control over their affairs and engaging in self-dealing transactions with them." According to the lawsuit, Universal Life persuaded an insurer, Prudential Financial, to submit false pricing information, which Universal Life provided its client, Viacom. In another case cited, the firm solicited fake bids to knock out an insurer that had no fee arrangement with it. The lawsuit cites other insurers, including MetLife and Unam Provident, but does not name them as defendants. The insurers, Mr. Spitzer said, "were participants and they should have objected and refused to go along." "The mastermind of this scheme is U.L.R., but the carriers were complicit and did not come forward rapidly enough," he said. Representatives from MetLife, Prudential and Unam Provident all said they were cooperating fully with Mr. Spitzer's suit but declined to comment further. In one example cited in the lawsuit, Universal Life and the Minnesota Life Insurance Company reached an agreement on a so-called override payment - defined in the lawsuit as additional payments to encourage brokers to direct business to insurers. Minnesota Life insisted that the payments be disclosed to the client. Universal Life, the lawsuit contends, refused to do the deal and stopped doing business with the life insurance company. Universal Life received $11.5 million of its $25.3 million in 2003 revenue in such override payments from insurers. The firm also reaped $5.6 million in 2003 in "communication fees," which were passed on to policyholders unbeknownst to them, the complaint said. The payments and fees totaled more than two-thirds of Universal Life's 2003 revenues. The suit seeks to end the special agreements, return any improper payments and provide restitution for injured parties, as well as seeking punitive damages. Insurance industry executives and consultants say the hidden practices described in Mr. Spitzer's lawsuit are long-established practices that have been adding to the cost of health care and other employee benefits for decades. "Whatever form the payments take, they are all ultimately passed onto employers and employees by the insurance companies,'' said John Randazzo, the chief executive of BenefitPoint, an electronic system that allows corporate customers and insurers to bid openly on employee benefits coverage. "All the money comes from the employers and employees and is built into the rates.'' Nearly all brokers in employee benefits receive payments from insurers known as contingency fees or placement service agreements for increased sales and profitability. The brokers, who promise to get the best coverage for their clients at the best prices, have routinely told their corporate clients that they were receiving payments from insurance companies without explaining how the payments influence their decisions. But industry executives say the payments are often the main factor in a broker's recommendation of which insurance company a client should choose. "The expectation on the part of the employer is that his broker will request bids for coverage from all the major insurers in a certain kind of coverage,'' Mr. Randazzo said. Mr. Spitzer's lawsuit follows one brought last month by the class-action law firm of Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman &amp; Robbins on behalf of an Intel employee. That suit says that Universal Life and a number of insurers "conspired to extract undisclosed compensation and fees from employers sponsoring employee-benefit plans and employees who purchase insurance policies offered through the employee-benefit plans." And the New York State Insurance Department issued citations yesterday against Universal Life for violations of state insurance law. "The New York State Insurance Department has charged the defendants with fraudulent, coercive and dishonest business conduct in the New York insurance market which has affected the price of insurance," said Gregory V. Serio, the superintendent. Joseph B.

In total, the company had $174 million of realized investment gains in the quarter, compared with $40 million of losses in the quarter a year earlier.Second-quarter profit last year included $126 million of gains from accounting changes in Mexico and a legal settlement in the United States.MetLife increased this year's profit forecast to a range of $3.22 to $3.30 a share excluding realized investment gains, from a previous estimate of $3.08 to $3.18 a share.Shares of MetLife closed up 8 cents yesterday, at $34.30, before the company announced its results.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/12/business/spitzer-inquiry-expands-to-employee-benefits-insurance.html?ref=metlifeinc">Spitzer Inquiry Expands to Employee-Benefits Insurance<date>Published: June 12, 2004</date><text>Three big insurance companies, Aetna, Cigna and MetLife, said yesterday that they had received subpoenas from the New York attorney general as an investigation widened into the field of employee benefits -- health, disability and group life insurance.Hartford, which operates a substantial business in group life and disability insurance as well as in commercial and personal lines of insurance, said late Thursday that it, too, had received a subpoena.Until now, the insurance investigations by the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, have centered on potential conflicts of interest among commercial insurance brokers and suspected improper sales and trading of variable annuities, which are a combination of insurance and mutual funds.Investigators have been concerned that payments from insurance companies to the brokers for exceeding sales goals and keeping down claims costs may undermine the brokers' loyalty to their customers -- the American corporations that pay them fees and commissions to arrange coverage.Industry executives said similar fees, often referred to as contingency payments, were widely paid to brokers and consultants by the employee benefits companies.''It's no surprise that Mr. Spitzer is pursuing these contingency payments in the employee benefits area,'' said Terry Havens, the chief executive of Havensure, a small employee benefits consulting firm in Cincinnati. ''Employers will likely be surprised to find out that their intermediaries -- brokers and consultants -- are negotiating financial agreements for themselves that raise the cost of corporate insurance.''None of the employee benefits insurers would discuss the investigations, and a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer did not return a call.Several insurance brokers disclosed in late April that they had received subpoenas from Mr. Spitzer, including Marsh and Aon, the two largest in the world, and Willis Group Holdings. In mid-May, the Chubb Group, a leader in commercial insurance, said that it, too, had received a subpoena for documents dealing with compensation to brokers. Hartford said in late May that it had received instructions from the New York Department of Insurance not to destroy any documents related to its dealings with brokers. The brokers have also refused to discuss the investigations.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/business/company-news-metlife-says-unit-may-face-sec-suit-over-trading.html?ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; METLIFE SAYS UNIT MAY FACE S.E.C. SUIT OVER TRADING<date>Published: May 15, 2004</date><text>MetLife said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission was likely to sue one of its units over trading involving variable insurance contracts. The S.E.C. sent a so-called Wells notice to the General American Life Insurance Company, a company subsidiary, MetLife said. The S.E.C. sends Wells notices when it has determined there is enough evidence of wrongdoing to warrant civil charges. MetLife, which will have the opportunity to respond before S.E.C. personnel make a formal recommendation, had disclosed that the S.E.C. was examining late trading and market timing in contracts sold by the General American division, based in St. Louis. MetLife said it didn't know of any systemic problems that would hurt its finances, and is cooperating with the investigation.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/23/business/for-wall-street-chiefs-big-paydays-continue.html?ref=metlifeinc">For Wall Street Chiefs, Big Paydays Continue<date>Published: March 23, 2004</date><text>As investor outrage over executive compensation rattled corporate boardrooms last year, some companies changed the way they set pay for their top officers. But the message apparently did not register on Wall Street, where chief executives like Sanford I. Weill of Citigroup and E. Stanley O'Neal of Merrill Lynch collected their biggest paychecks ever in 2003 -- $44 million and $28 million.Companies that reduced the pay of their chief executives despite healthy performances included MetLife, American Express and the MBNA Corporation. MBNA joined a trend by saying it would curtail the use of stock options. But at Bear Stearns, the big Wall Street investment bank, James E. Cayne received three times as much in stock options as he did the year before. Over all, Mr. Cayne received $27 million last year compared with $19.6 million in 2002.On Wall Street, where executive compensation has always been closely tied to a firm's performance, the big pay packages of 2003 might be explained simply as the fruits of a robust year for the financial markets.''I don't think there's been a huge philosophical change on Wall Street; they've always had a pay-for-performance mentality,'' said Alan Johnson, a pay consultant in New York. Though, he added, ''We were surprised how high they've been.''Still, in the view of experts like Pearl Meyer, a compensation consultant, Wall Street is bucking the trend in many other industries, where a good year for the company does not necessarily translate into a rich payday for the chief. The credit card company American Express, for instance, paid Kenneth I. Chenault, its chief executive, 18 percent less last year than in 2002 -- despite a 36 percent rise in its share price.''What boards are saying is superb performance doesn't warrant excessive compensation,'' said Ms. Meyer, the chairwoman of Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners in Manhattan.In a survey of 50 of the biggest American corporations, her firm found that the cash and restricted stock given to chief executives rose 38 percent last year but that a sharp decline in the value of the options granted to them more than offset the increase. All told, she said, the average pay package for those 50 chief executives was 8 percent smaller than in 2002, although it still amounted to $10.3 million.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/12/business/company-news-metlife-affiliate-agrees-to-sell-sears-tower.html?ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; METLIFE AFFILIATE AGREES TO SELL SEARS TOWER<date>Published: March 12, 2004</date><text>MetLife said yesterday that an affiliate had agreed to sell the Sears Tower, which at 110 stories is the tallest building in the United States, a little more than six months after it took control of the building. It said it expected an after-tax gain of about $90 million. MetLife, based in New York, has held the primary mortgage on the building, in Chicago, since 1990 through the affiliate, Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity. MetLife declined to disclose the buyer or the purchase price, citing a nondisclosure agreement. MetLife bought control of the building from Trizec Properties for $9 million in August. The deal released Trizec from $766 million in anticipated mortgage payments.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/06/business/company-news-metlife-says-sec-is-investigating-sales-of-life-insurance.html?ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; METLIFE SAYS S.E.C.

Profit excluding realized investment losses was 81 cents, compared with the 73 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Excluding previously announced benefits from a legal settlement and an income tax revision, operating earnings were 73 cents.The earnings are the first since MetLife fired four employees in August and cut previously reported second-quarter earnings by $31 million after discovering employees tried to inflate earnings with false accounting.The company, which is based in New York, said at the time that it was an isolated problem, and MetLife has not reported new incidents.The company, which also sells auto and home insurance, reported $169 million of losses from corporate bonds and other investments in last year's third quarter.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/business/company-news-insurance-companies-get-verdict-reduction.html?ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; INSURANCE COMPANIES GET VERDICT REDUCTION<date>Published: October 23, 2003</date><text>MetLife and the UnumProvident Corporation won a $72 million reduction in an $85.7 million verdict awarded in April to an Arizona cardiologist who said the insurance companies unfairly denied her disability claims. The cardiologist, Joanne Ceimo, said a herniated disk in her neck prevented her from doing surgery and sued MetLife's General American Life Insurance and Unum's Paul Revere and Provident subsidiaries when her claim was denied. In April, a federal jury in Phoenix awarded Ms. Ceimo $85.7 million, including $79 million in punitive damages. MetLife and UnumProvident called the verdict excessive and sought to have it set aside. Judge Frederick J. Martone of United States District Court in Phoenix reduced the punitive damages to $7 million while denying the insurance companies motions to reverse the verdict. MetLife said it had appealed the decision, seeking dismissal of the entire award. UnumProvident said it intended to appeal.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/15/business/company-news-metlife-forms-joint-venture-in-china-to-sell-insurance.html?ref=metlifeinc">COMPANY NEWS; METLIFE FORMS JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA TO SELL INSURANCE<date>Published: October 15, 2003</date><text>MetLife said yesterday that it had it formed a joint venture to sell policies in China with the the Capital Airports Holding Company.

Beyond that, though, many are baffled.Puzzling letters from the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal began to arrive in the mail late last week declaring that residents of the 2,200-unit apartment complex would have to pay an extra $38.35 per room, per month. Not only that, the letter said, but residents would also have to pay as much as $3,000 or $4,000 in retroactive rent increases.The letters sent a tremor through the complex, located on East 20th Street in Manhattan. Some residents said they would have to dip into their savings or spend less on prescription medicine, while others said they would have think twice about spending money to visit their adult children. They said the rent increases could push the more vulnerable residents out of this tree-lined, mythically affordable complex, built after World War II to house returning veterans.But wait.Another section of the letter sent to residents -- paragraph VI, subparagraph C, to be precise -- said that under rent stabilization law, rent increases could not exceed 6 percent of a resident's rent. Residents who live in a $1,000 apartment, for instance, would pay an extra $60 per month.''The majority of people don't have the faintest idea of what this means,'' said Anita Newman, a longtime resident, as she pored over the letter sent to her. ''What are they saying? We don't understand what they're saying.''The increases stem from a $30 million electrical rewiring in 1999. Metropolitan Life Insurance, which owns Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town next door, wanted residents to pay for the work, but the tenants' association protested, saying that MetLife stood to earn millions from a cable company that performed installations at the same time.The tenants took their case to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, charging that MetLife had inflated the costs of rewiring the electrical system, had done poor-quality work and had allowed the same work crews to simultaneously install the new wiring and cable lines for the RCN Corporation.''You have two projects that were merged, that sort of melded into one,'' said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, who lives in Peter Cooper Village. ''It was a very, very questionable maneuver.''</text></article></page></root>
