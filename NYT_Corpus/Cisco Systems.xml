This should buy its chief executive, John Chambers, time from shareholders to retire gracefully in three years. But it probably won’t result in big gains for investors, if rival technology valuations are any guide. For more than a decade, Cisco plowed profits from its networking equipment business into lower-margin areas like consumer electronics. Meanwhile, Cisco’s core markets, like switches, were under assault. Shareholders failed to see the merits of this trade-off and increasingly worried about the durability of Cisco’s profits. That resulted in what Wall Streeters call “multiple compression.” While this fiscal year’s earnings per share should be almost 90 percent higher than they were in 2006, the stock has lost about a quarter of its value. Cisco now trades at 13 times estimated earnings. While other big tech firms also saw their multiples fall, Cisco suffered disproportionately. Mr. Chambers is now wisely forswearing big acquisitions, paying dividends and investing more in crucial businesses. But increasing the amount investors are willing to pay for Cisco’s profits, which would put a rocket under the stock, is a tall order. At around $17, Cisco shares trade at a slight premium to I.B.M.’s stock and a 17 percent discount to Oracle’s, based on estimated earnings. That’s probably about right, because Cisco’s margins are more exposed to hardware deflation. So the company needs to show faster growth if it wants a better multiple. Unfortunately, Cisco estimates revenue will increase by 5 to 7 percent over the next three years. That’s about the same as analysts predict for I.B.M. and Oracle. Perhaps Cisco may be setting a bar it can easily vault. Or it may have a dour view of the market. The company doesn’t think it will lose market share, but rivals like Juniper Networks, Riverbed Technology and the emergent Chinese powerhouse Huawei are gunning for Cisco. Cisco’s new, down-to-earth approach to its future is a welcome change. But while it may halt the decade-long descent of its share price, a period in purgatory may still await investors. More on Greece Greece needs a proper debt restructuring. Getting the country’s borrowing under control requires a serious haircut for both private creditors and euro zone governments. If it happened today, private bondholders could bear most of the losses, according to Breakingviews calculations. But if the euro zone delays, taxpayers will suffer more. By the end of 2011, Greece’s debt will be 357 billion euros (about $492 billion), more than 160 percent of this year’s forecast gross domestic product. To be sustainable, this ratio should probably be cut in half, to about 80 percent. That would give Greece breathing room to recapitalize its banks and finance its budget deficit. Some debt is protected: the International Monetary Fund is a preferred creditor, while politicians may also exclude Greece’s T-bills, which are short-dated securities the country needs to manage its cash needs. That leaves euro zone governments, which have lent Greece 53 billion euros; the European Central Bank, which owns Greek government bonds worth some 45 billion euros; and private creditors that are owed the remaining 223 billion euros to split the pain. If private bondholders took a 60 percent haircut today, the public sector would have to write down its debt by almost 50 percent, or about 47 billion euros. Politicians might try to avoid this unpopular move by opting for a voluntary debt swap, like the deal brokered by the Institute of International Finance. But this will do little to ease Greece’s debt. Meanwhile, the euro zone’s exposure will increase. By the end of 2012, the euro zone and the I.M.F. will have lent Greece another 32 billion euros to finance its deficit and bond redemptions. And Athens will have borrowed a further 71.4 billion euros to buy back debt and finance the collateral it has promised to private creditors under the debt swap. If private creditors take a 60 percent write-down next year, official loans would have to be written down by 67 percent to reduce Greece’s debt to 80 percent of G.D.P., a loss of 120 billion euros. Governments could disguise the pain by stretching out loan repayments and slashing interest rates. Even so, politicians would have a hard time explaining why they put more taxpayers’ cash at risk when Greece’s debt was clearly unsustainable.

Networking giant Cisco Systems is waiting. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. At a speech at the Oracle OpenWorld trade show Wednesday, John Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, predicted that “video will be the platform for all forms of communication in I.T. as we go forward.” While he was addressing this message to several thousand corporate I.T. professionals, Mr. Chambers also saw consumers moving to more video too because the Internet-connected mobile devices enable easier video production and consumption. “There will be one million TV stations in the U.S.,” he said. “You’ll have Little League stations, home stations.” It is a position which, not surprisingly, plays well to Cisco’s strategy. The more bits travel over the Internet, the more demand there is for Cisco-style routers, and few things create more bits than video. It is defensible, too: The sheer magnitude of the task of networking high-bandwidth content favors capital-rich incumbents over start-ups. Cisco, Mr. Chambers said, “no longer makes devices that are not video capable.” But there are plenty of reasons to think Mr. Chambers has a point. As cameras in smartphones like the new Apple iPhone 4S get better, and memory gets cheaper, there will be more video on the fly. Within the corporate world, Cisco and competitors like Polycom and Microsoft are benefiting from the growth of so-called telepresence meetings over the Web where people meet virtually through individual cameras on their desks. The “hangout” feature on Google’s Google+ social networking software is the latest version of this, and Google is working on ways to tie those video sessions to its calendar, spreadsheet and document sharing office productivity products. Mr. Chambers also demonstrated some stunning, and potentially creepy, ways this may be going. He showed a new Cisco device in which all the talking in the conference session could be transcribed by machine. Words and terms were later searchable to find points in the video when they were mentioned. The company is also working with a maker of infrared cameras that detect the blood-water content of human skin. Mr. Chambers showed how Cisco could measure the number of people in a car, so a government could decide how much to charge on a toll road. Even if the video boom does not happen as big or as fast as Mr. Chambers expects, he had other reasons to justify his natural optimism. Since 2007, he said, the world had gone from one Internet-connected device per person to five devices per person today. By 2013, he predicted, there would be 140 connected devices per person. Most of those are likely sensors, which don’t consume anything like the bandwidth of video. But they do add up, increasing the demand for networking gear.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/huawei-wants-to-sell-to-american-companies/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Huawei Wants to Sell to American Companies<date>October 5, 2011, 6:20 pm</date><text>Huawei, the Chinese computer networking company that in the past has been involved in numerous controversies with American companies and the federal government, has announced an initiative to sell its products to American businesses in the United States. The so-called Enterprise Business group, which among other things will focus on telephone systems, computer centers and video conferencing, is the latest move in a campaign by Huawei to win greater legitimacy and market share. In 2010, the company established a technical center in Silicon Valley. Since then, the Valley complex has grown to about 1,000 senior technical staff members, “most of them with 20 to 30 years’ experience,” according to John Roese, Huawei’s senior vice president and general manager for North America. “We’re not a typical company,” said Mr. Roese, who was previously chief technical officer at Nortel, the once-giant Canadian network company. While Huawei had revenues of about $29 billion last year, Mr. Roese said the enterprise business was still building up. “Think of it like a very big series ‘B’ company, with very deep resources.” In 2010, he said, sales to corporations were about $2 billion, and this year they should hit about $4 billion. “The year after, we’re targeting $7 billion, so we’re just getting started,” Mr. Roese said. The long-term goal, he said, is $10 to $15 billion in earnings. Almost none of those profits come from the United States, but there is no mistaking Huawei’s seriousness about entering the challenging but rich market. “We’ll start out with higher education and multinationals with lots of exposure in the developing world,” Mr. Roese said. The usual clients of most networking companies, financial institutions and the government, will not be a priority. Working with a number of independent equipment resellers, Huawei hopes to eventually offer products that address the increasingly overlapping telecom, business and consumer markets. That would include products that range from tablet computers to large-scale communications switches. “The enterprise business doesn’t look like it used to,” Mr. Roese said. “Most existing solutions confine their customers too much.” Success may depend as much on Huawei’s unusually contentious history in the United States, however, as any reality of the market. Fair or unfair, the perception of Huawei as a spying tool of China is something the company is addressing actively. Earlier this year Huawei complained about a federal government recommendation that Huawei not acquire an American technology company. The letter also addressed what it called “longstanding and untrue rumors and allegations” about itself, including that Huawei’s founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, still has ties to the People’s Liberation Army. While Mr. Ren served in China’s national army, Huawei said, he left it in 1983. Huawei also noted its previous intellectual property lawsuits with the American companies Qualcomm and Cisco Systems, both of which it resolved. The I.P. suit with Cisco, settled in 2003, included some interesting exhibits starting on Page 72 of a federal district court filing. Huawei also wrote about whether it spies on behalf of China: “The allegation that Huawei somehow poses a threat to the national security of the United States has centered on a mistaken belief that our company can use our technology to steal confidential information in the United States or launch network attacks on entities in the U.S. at a specific time. There is no evidence that Huawei has violated any security rules.” Since then, Huawei has also provided greater details about its financial state, identified the members of its board and hired a British government official as the head of a global cybersecurity division. It is not clear whether any of this will help it win the market, but the company has decided that formally addressing American businesses is the next step. “We need to announce our commitment to the market,” Mr. Roese said. “This is a big net we’re throwing out.” This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 6, 2011 An earlier version of this post misspelled the surname of Huawei’s senior vice president and general manager for North America. He is John Roese, not Rose.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/keep-your-tech-friends-close-but-keep-your-enemies-closer/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Keep Your Tech Friends Close, but Keep Your Enemies Closer<date>October 3, 2011, 7:20 pm</date><text>If you are in business, you probably do not spend resources praising your competitor. But then, you’re probably also not the chief executive of a large tech company that is competing with the Oracle Corporation. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. On Monday morning, Joseph Tucci, chief executive of the data storage giant EMC, gave a talk at the Oracle OpenWorld trade show in San Francisco. That seems odd, considering Oracle makes its own data storage devices. And on Tuesday, Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Inc., whose computer servers compete with Oracle’s machines, will take the stage. What’s with the corporate frenemies? “I walk past our booth and it’s packed,” Mr. Tucci said. “It’s great of Oracle to pound their point of view out there — it’s their show — but we can get ours out too.” In other words, the 45,000 people who show up here are all potential sales targets. Why not show up, praise Oracle onstage, and go at it on the sales floor? Indeed, the claims of Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, on Sunday that Oracle’s data analysis system was eight times faster than the competition was fresh meat for Mr. Tucci. “They’re eight times faster in what way?” he said. “Let’s hear a few specifics on that.” Like Mr. Ellison, Mr. Tucci is a veteran of the business and enjoys the competition. “I’m happy to have someone come straight at me, versus someone putting their arm around me and acting like my friend. One thing about Oracle, they tell you what they are doing.” Not all the onstage corporate talent is as kind as Mr. Tucci. Marc Benioff, the head of Salesforce.com and a onetime top protege of Mr. Ellison, spent part of his Monday morning on Facebook and Twitter, reposting the work of bloggers who panned Mr. Ellison’s Sunday night keynote speech. “A low bar has been set. See you Wednesday at 10 a.m.!” Mr. Benioff wrote on Twitter. At last check, Oracle still plans to have him onstage. The love among antagonists is also a mark of the industry changes wrought by new computer architectures and old-fashioned industry consolidation. John Chambers, the chief executive of the computer networking company Cisco Systems, will be speaking Wednesday. While Oracle does not yet have a significant networking business, Cisco makes online storage and computer server products, putting it in conflict with Oracle and EMC. But Cisco also has a joint venture to sell products with EMC and its majority-owned affiliate VMWare. EMC has also purchased analytic software companies that compete with the analytics products Oracle announced Sunday. It may be a mark of an industry in transition, but it is unlikely to end soon. Mr. Tucci recently said he will retire at the end of 2012, moving to chairman of the EMC board for two to four years. His successor is almost certain to be Pat Gelsinger, EMC’s president and chief operating officer for infrastructure products (Mr. Tucci would not comment on succession.) On Monday, Mr. Gelsinger followed Mr. Tucci onstage, where he demonstrated a new EMC data storage device that can fit right into a server — the kind made by Oracle and Dell.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/designing-a-greener-commute-in-the-bay-area/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Designing a Greener Commute in the Bay Area<date>September 14, 2011, 11:55 am</date><text>Commute ScoreA winning concept in the Cleanweb Hackathon assigns points based on the carbon-intensiveness of a commuter’s trip. What can data do for your daily commute? A team of energy policy consultants and software developers met in San Francisco to brainstorm how data sets could be used to make the typical urban commute shorter and greener. They participated in a high-speed coding competition last weekend called the Cleanweb Hackathon. Similar to the collaborative programming sprints used by companies like Facebook and Google to increase workers’ creativity, the Cleanweb Hackathon gave participants 24 hours to build apps from scratch in teams. The stated goal of the event, organized by the venture capitalist Sunil Paul, was to “demonstrate the impact of applying information technology to resource constraints.” One such team devised a system that would reward commercial buildings with incentives like carbon credits, for example, when occupants bike, walk and bus to work instead of driving. The team’s demo application, called Commute Score, was one of 14 tools created as part of the event. According to Kimberly Goodrich, a Commute Score team member, her group wanted to find a way to “bring your commute into the energy equation.” A downtown commercial property may not have adequate room for solar panels, but if its occupants commute by public transit, it may be greener than a solar-powered office park where workers drive a hundred miles each day. Tracking a building’s energy use isn’t enough, they argued; it also matters how people get there. For Commute Score, the developers Bryan Galusha and Andrew Aarestad “created a way to track a commute on a smartphone and then identify the transit signature (walk, bike, bus, train or car) of the commuter,” Ms. Goodrich wrote in an e-mail. “From this data, we attributed carbon kudos to various modes of transit to generate a Commute Score,” she added. Judges for the event included Mr. Paul and the industrial designer Yves Behar, as well as executives from Cisco; Tendril, a smart-grid technology company; Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich and Rosati, a Silicon Valley law firm; and Catamount Ventures, a venture capital firm. On Sunday, the judges awarded Commute Score first prize in the category of Biggest Impact. Other entries dealing with transportation included Tarzan, which integrates traffic and emissions data with a trip planner and calendar, and GreenScore, which employs traffic, fuel consumption and pollution data to rate cities and states for their green performance. Hackathon organizers collected 11 different data sets related to transportation, ranging from real-time traffic documentation from Google to development platforms provided by local transit agencies. But Commute Score ultimately based its signatures on original data collected by Ms. Goodrich and her teammate Dan Suyeyasu, who walked, biked, bused and took trains around San Francisco on Saturday carrying phones with GPS chips. Another team is planning to introduce a version of its Get Tarzan app on Oct. 1. Built using Google Maps and Google Calendar, as well as the Bing search engine and the local weather forecasting Web site WeatherUnderground.com, the tool combines a calendar and route planner, simplifying travel time and costs considerations across multiple modes of transportation. Get TarzanGet Tarzan’s mobile interface. According to Ezra Goldman, a Get Tarzan team member, some of the key features of the concept include factoring in time for parking, I.R.S. tax-deduction rates and real-time data about traffic delays. The mobile version of the app also brings in weather forecasts to help users make decisions about walking or biking. “Future versions could help you to plan your days to do efficient trip ‘chaining’ and avoid unnecessary trips,” Mr. Goldman wrote in an e-mail. The team also says that the app could eventually incorporate taxis or “emerging modes of travel, like car sharing, ride sharing and bike sharing.” Collaborations between independent software developers and transportation companies are increasingly common. On Monday, Ford Motor Company suggested at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, that the car itself could become a platform for the kind of rapid-fire innovation inspired by the Cleanweb Hackathon. As noted by our colleagues at the Bits blog, the automaker has partnered with Bug Labs, an open-source hardware and software provider, to enable people to add electronic components to their cars. And to demonstrate what could be possible as Bug Labs’ so-called OpenXC platform makes its way into Ford’s vehicles, the companies showed off an in-car fuel monitor designed to let drivers compare their fuel consumption to other drivers.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/finding-the-next-netlogic/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Finding the Next NetLogic<date>September 12, 2011, 1:07 pm</date><text>Broadcom is opening its wallet wide — to the tune of $3.7 billion — to acquire NetLogic, a maker of advanced chips for routers. The transaction, Broadcom’s biggest to date, will give NetLogic’s shareholders a 57 percent premium to the company’s closing price on Friday. Now, analysts are wondering, who’s next? On Monday, several chip makers rose following news of the deal. Shares of Cavium, one of NetLogic’s closest rivals, rose about 5 percent in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, EZchip Semiconductor jumped about 9 percent. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Broadcom to Buy NetLogic for $3.7 Billion Momentum for the market has been building, as the world’s data needs surge. As more consumers buy smart phones and spend more hours scanning the Web, the companies that help build the pipelines of the communications industry are becoming increasingly important. NetLogic, for instance, designs the processors that are built into the routers, created by companies like Cisco and Shenzhen, China-based Huawei. NetLogic, analysts say, was able to command a high premium because of its patent portfolio and the technological complexity of its products. If Broadcom tried to build a similar suite from scratch, its team would need five, potentially more, years according to Cody Acree, a Williams Financial analyst. “All of these companies, whether NetLogic, or Cavium or EZchip have been primary candidates for acquisitions,” said Mr. Acree. “Its such a fast growing, technically challenging space, and its very difficult to get in on your own.” According to analysts, Broadcom was likely interested in both NetLogic and Cavium, which also makes semiconductor processors for routers. Earlier this year, Cavium recorded sales of $71.6 million for the second quarter, a 12.7 percent increase from the year ago period. It also reported profit of $1.9 million. For comparison, NetLogic posted revenue of $103.7 million and a loss of $35.2 million for the period. EZchip, an Israeli-chip maker operates in the same space as NetLogic, but its high-speed processors serve different functions on the router. It does, however, serve many of the same customers, including Chinese chip makers Huawei and ZTE. According to analysts, large chip-makers like Marvell Technology, which has a considerable presence in the communications infrastructure market, Altera, and Texas Instruments, could be among the suitors. However, Dan Berenbaum, a MKM Partners analyst, says Texas Instruments may have a muted appetite in the near term, since it is still digesting its acquisition of National Semiconductor and has been very focused on its analog portfolio.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/technology/group-says-it-has-new-evidence-of-ciscos-misdeeds-in-china.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Group Says It Has New Evidence of Cisco’s Misdeeds in China<date>Published: September 2, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — An advocacy group that accuses Cisco Systems of aiding the Chinese government in monitoring and apprehending members of the banned Falun Gong organization said Friday that it had new evidence to suggest that Cisco specifically tailored its technology for that purpose. The Human Rights Law Foundation, based in Washington, sued Cisco, a California-based manufacturer of networking equipment, last May in the Federal District Court in San Jose, under a statute that allows American companies to be sued for violations of human rights abroad. The suit accused Cisco of having helped China build a firewall, known widely as the Golden Shield, to censor the Internet and keep tabs on dissidents.

Another document, which the group says was used by Cisco’s sales teams, described a broad public security database that would contain information on Chinese citizens, including “key personnel of ‘Falun Gong’ evil cult organization.” That database would in turn be connected to a system of firewalls and monitoring systems that could be used to filter content that the Chinese government considers to be sensitive. It is not clear if such a system was ever built, and it was not possible to verify the authenticity of the documents.

Muammar el-Qaddafi’s extensive spying apparatus, which the Libyan transitional government uncovered earlier this week. The monitoring of text messages, e-mails and online chats — no communications seemed beyond the reach of the eccentric colonel. What is even more surprising is where Colonel Qaddafi got his spying gear: software and technology companies from France, South Africa and other countries. Narus, an American company owned by Boeing, met with Colonel Qaddafi’s people just as the protests were getting under way, but shied away from striking a deal. As Narus had previously supplied similar technology to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, it was probably a matter of public relations, not business ethics. Amid the cheerleading over recent events in the Middle East, it’s easy to forget the more repressive uses of technology. In addition to the rosy narrative celebrating how Facebook and Twitter have enabled freedom movements around the world, we need to confront a more sinister tale: how greedy companies, fostered by Western governments for domestic surveillance needs, have helped suppress them. Libya is only the latest place where Western surveillance technology has turned up. Human rights activists arrested and later released in Bahrain report being presented with transcripts of their own text messages — a capacity their government acquired through equipment from Siemens, the German industrial giant, and maintained by Nokia Siemens Networks, based in Finland, and Trovicor, another German company. Earlier this year, after storming the secret police headquarters, Egyptian activists discovered that the Mubarak government had been using a trial version of a tool — developed by Britain’s Gamma International — that allowed them to eavesdrop on Skype conversations, widely believed to be safe from wiretapping. And it’s not just off-the-shelf technology; some Western companies supply dictators with customized solutions to block offensive Web sites. A March report by OpenNet Initiative, an academic group that monitors Internet censorship, revealed that Netsweeper, based in Canada, together with the American companies Websense and McAfee (now owned by Intel), have developed programs to meet most of the censorship needs of governments in the Middle East and North Africa — in Websense’s case, despite promises not to supply its technology to repressive governments. Unfortunately, the American government, the world’s most vociferous defender of “Internet freedom,” has little to say about such complicity. Though Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton often speaks publicly on the subject, she has yet to address how companies from her country undermine her stated goal. To add insult to injury, in December the State Department gave Cisco — which supplied parts for China’s so-called Great Firewall — an award in recognition of its “good corporate citizenship.” Such reticence may not be entirely accidental, since many of these tools were first developed for Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Western policy makers are therefore in a delicate spot. On the one hand, it is hard to rein in the very companies they have nurtured; it is also hard to resist the argument from repressive regimes that they need such technologies to monitor extremists. On the other hand, it’s getting harder to ignore the fact that extremists aren’t the only ones under surveillance. The obvious response is to ban the export of such technologies to repressive governments. But as long as Western states continue using monitoring technologies themselves, sanctions won’t completely eliminate the problem — the supply will always find a way to meet the demand. Moreover, dictators who are keen on fighting extremism are still welcome in Washington: it’s a good bet that much of the electronic spying done in Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt was done with the tacit support of his American allies. What we need is a recognition that our reliance on surveillance technology domestically — even if it is checked by the legal system — is inadvertently undermining freedom in places where the legal system provides little if any protection. That recognition should, in turn, fuel tighter restrictions on the domestic surveillance-technology sector, including a reconsideration of the extent to which it actually needs such technology in our increasingly privacy-free world.  As countries like Belarus, Iran and Myanmar digest the lessons of the Arab Spring, their demand for monitoring technology will grow. Left uncontrolled, Western surveillance tools could undermine the “Internet freedom” agenda in the same way arms exports undermine Western-led peace initiatives. How many activists, finding themselves confronted with information collected using Western technology, would trust the pronouncements of Western governments again?

John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, who is trying to restructure and refocus the company after a year of stumbles attributed partly to slow decision-making, has said it would be some time before his efforts produced results. Cisco has long been considered a bellwether for technology spending, but its internal problems have made it a less reliable stand-in for the broader technology industry. Cisco makes routers and switches used by corporations and government agencies to operate data centers and telecommunications networks. But spending by the public sector, which makes up a fifth of Cisco’s overall sales, continues to decline. Spending by government agencies, public universities and hospitals fell 4 percent in its fourth quarter, the company said. Mr. Chambers said, “You are seeing people making tough decisions about what to cut.” Cisco reported that its net income in the fourth quarter that ended July 30 fell 36.3 percent to $1.2 billion, or 22 cents a share, from $1.9 billion, or 33 cents, in the same quarter a year ago. The company said revenue climbed 3.3 percent to $11.2 billion, from $10.8 billion. The adjusted income of 40 cents was slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 38 cents a share and revenue of $10.98 billion on that basis, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. The lack of more bad news was enough to buoy the company’s shares. Jason Ader, an analyst with William Blair &amp; Company, said that Cisco’s forecast for relatively flat revenue in the first quarter was good news given the convulsions in the stock market recently. It shows some confidence by Cisco in corporate technology spending even as public sector sales are weak. “People have been looking for stability,” Mr. Ader said. “It was a much more positive call than it has been in a year.” The gain in Cisco’s shares in after-hours trading on Wednesday made up only part of the more than 40 percent decline over the last 12 months. They rose 93 cents, or 6. 7 percent, to $14.66 in after-hours trading. In regular trading, they fell 33 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $13.73. While Cisco struggled over the last year, smaller rivals like Juniper Networks performed relatively well. More recently, however, Juniper and Brocade Communications Systems, another maker of technology equipment, have warned of slumping demand for their products. While Cisco’s main primary products faced headwinds, some of its other businesses have showed strong growth in recent quarters. They continued to do so in the fourth quarter with a 32 percent gain in revenue from data center products and 33 percent increase from wireless products. Mr. Chambers is counting on these newer areas to lift the company as its more mature products retreat or make small gains. Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., said it expected operating of 38 cents a share to 41 cents a share in the first quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.SAN FRANCISCO — Cisco Systems managed to encourage investors Wednesday despite sliding quarterly profits and flat revenue growth, prompting a nearly 7 percent run-up in its shares during after-hours trading. John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, who is trying to restructure and refocus the company after a year of stumbles attributed partly to slow decision-making, has said it would be some time before his efforts produced results. Cisco has long been considered a bellwether for technology spending, but its internal problems have made it a less reliable stand-in for the broader technology industry. Cisco makes routers and switches used by corporations and government agencies to operate data centers and telecommunications networks. But spending by the public sector, which makes up a fifth of Cisco’s overall sales, continues to decline.

A year and a half after Google pulled its search engine out of China to avoid censorship, Microsoft’s Bing still censors searches in China. Earlier this month, it agreed to provide search results in English for Baidu, China’s leading — and heavily censored — engine. The United States needs enforceable standards of ethical behavior when American companies work with authoritarian governments. In May, Chinese practitioners of Falun Gong sued Cisco, accusing it of helping the Chinese government design and maintain the so-called Golden Shield system used to track and target dissidents online, including Falun Gong followers who were apprehended and tortured. Cisco denies the accusation. It says it does not customize equipment to help any government censor content, intercept communications or track users. It says it only sells the Chinese government standard-issue equipment and that it is not selling cameras or image-management software in Chongqing, only general network equipment. Nevertheless, Cisco’s experience confirms that we need uniform principles to guide corporate behavior. After Yahoo handed over data five years ago about a Chinese journalist who was condemned to 10 years in jail, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google joined in the Global Network Initiative to set principles that include protecting “the freedom of expression rights of their users when confronted with government demands, laws and regulations to suppress freedom of expression.” Voluntary guidelines are insufficient. Just as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act establishes that companies cannot bribe foreign officials, legislation is needed in this area. Internet companies should not keep user data inside countries where courts convict people for what they write, speak or think. They should warn users about their risks, and they should never censor content. American firms were barred from selling crime-control products to China after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. The list must be broadened and kept up to date. Firms could be barred from selling technology to eavesdrop on VoIP communications or powerful antispam systems that could be used to target political speech. Technology companies should be barred from tailoring goods to a repressive end. An article this month about the Chongqing project in The Wall Street Journal quoted an executive at Hewlett-Packard, which is planning to bid on the project. “It’s not my job to really understand what they’re going to use it for,” he said. That’s not nearly good enough.American technology companies are eager to do business in China, sometimes too eager.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/technology/cisco-cutting-6500-workers-to-lower-costs.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco Cutting 6,500 Workers to Lower Costs<date>Published: July 18, 2011</date><text>Cisco Systems, the networking equipment maker, said it was cutting 6,500 employees, or about 9 percent of its work force, after it said in May that it planned to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs.

In May, Cisco said it planned to eliminate thousands of jobs as part of a larger plan to lower annual expenses by $1 billion, or about 6 percent. Cisco did not say then how many jobs would be eliminated. The exact number has been the subject of many analyst and published reports since then. The numbers announced Monday are much higher than the 6 percent figure. The company, which is based in San Jose, Calif., has been struggling as competition rises from companies like Juniper Networks and Hewlett-Packard in the computer networking equipment market.

It just seemed like such a ham-handed, thoughtless way to terminate an iconic, very popular gadget. I continue to read, online and in newspapers, that Cisco killed the Flip camcorder because the writing was on the wall: smartphones now have video capability, so nobody needs a standalone gadget. I’ve written before on the topic of single-purpose versus multipurpose gadgets. But today, here’s an especially articulate essay on this subject. It’s a guest post from Nasahn Sheppard, director of industrial design at Smart Design, the company that designed the Flip camcorder itself. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. Sign up | See Sample Swiss Army knives work well for many things, but that does not mean they work best for everything.  Swiss army knives are great. I love them, and as a designer I appreciate how they have become an indispensable tool. For instance, after graduating college, I took an amazing five-month backpack trip though Europe. As I roamed from country to country soaking up Europe’s treasures, my Swiss Army knife was a trusted companion. I had carefully chosen mine because it had a fork, tweezers, pen, saw (you never know), nail cutter, and not one, but two knife blades ready to support a spontaneous picnic. But as great as my Swiss Army knife was, when I got home, I didn’t use it to prepare dinner. Why didn’t I want to use it as a primary kitchen tool? Because its versatility comes at a price. In my travels, it fit my needs perfectly; but at home, it’s…well, completely inadequate. Context dictates the scale of people’s need. And people’s product experiences depend deeply on the context in which they’re used. Today, smartphones are touted as the digital equivalent of Swiss Army knives—extremely versatile, do-it-all devices that can be tailored to any situation. They are fundamentally changing the way we communicate, do business, think of computing, and have fun. As the darling of the tech world, it seems like they are destined to drive single purpose products out of business. A recent case in point, a few months ago Cisco decided to “retire” the Flip brand of camcorders. Immediately, everybody was pointing the finger at the smartphone as the cause. It’s a great story, but far from the real reasons Flip was shut down. According to Gartner research, sales of smartphones are dramatically up. But collectively, they make up only 297 million units, or less than 19 percent of the global mobile phone market. Their growth will continue, of course, and play an increasingly important role in people’s lives. But they can never be a singular convergent solution. A smartphone will someday be able to unlock and turn on our cars, but that doesn’t mean we’ll want to use it as the steering wheel. In some contexts, it’s just better to do one thing really well instead of five things adequately. Just as the Swiss Army knife, the smartphone succeeds in some occasions and fails in others. People still prefer the comfort of watching media on a large screen TV, typing on a full size keyboard, and having a long call on a comfortable handset. Single-purpose devices are still entering the marketplace and finding great success because they’re focused on real-life contexts. The Kindle is a prime example. It has all the potential to be ‘more,’ but Amazon has shown great restraint to keep it simple and focused on the pleasures of long-form reading. This type of mode-specific design is not easy thing to do. I’m sure the pressures to clutter up the Kindle with other stuff are great. But restraint is what makes the Kindle so successful. The iPad, a large smartphone, has not displaced the Kindle as many prophesied, and the two successfully co-exist in the world. Smart Design, the firm I work for, had the privilege of collaborating four years ago with Pure Digital Technologies, a small start-up full of passionate people with big dreams; the result of our work together was the Flip Video line of camcorders. Our shared vision was an easy-to-use, simple video camera that empowered people to share their lives. Throughout the development of the Flip, there was one question the team repeatedly asked ourselves: “What can we take out, not what can we put in?” This simple question guided every design decision. The result was a product that people immediately understood, enabling them to incorporate video into their lives in a ways they never imagined. The context was right for a wide variety of people. It even turned my five-year-old daughter into the family Spielberg. Many of the tenets that helped make Flip a amazing success are found in the Kindle and other successful single-purpose devices today. Even though it makes up less then 3 percent of total global mobile phone sales, the iPhone’s success is unmatched. It’s been incredibly successful for Apple. So why haven’t they gotten rid of iPods, Nanos, and Shuffles? With the versatility of the iPhone, shouldn’t these other single focused products be doomed to fail? The short answer might be, sometimes a Shuffle is all you need. Once again, context dictates the need. In September 2009, Apple introduced the fifth generation Nano. During the Steve Jobs keynote address, he showed a competitive product: the Flip. “This market is really exploding, and we want to get in on this,” Jobs said. With a Flip on the giant presentation screen, Jobs launches into a side-by-side comparison of the new Nano and Flip. He promised twice the memory, a radically smaller shape, and great video capabilities. The implications were clear: Flip was a fat, single-purpose device that was about to be out-classed by the ultrathin Nano. Immediately, critics said this was the demise of Flip, but in fact, the exact opposite happened. After Flip’s guest appearance, its sales continue to accelerate at a blistering pace. And in the following Nano version, Apple decided to remove the video camera feature. Video did not fit with people’s use scenario of the Nano. It was the wrong context. Flip was the undisputed leader of a category that it had helped to create. It fundamentally reshaped the video capturing market. Most importantly, it did exactly (and only) what it promised it would do; its fun, approachable, mode-specific design allowed people to capture and share the in-between moments in their lives. As a parent, the moments of life I want to capture are fleeting. Pulling out my smartphone, launching an app, and waiting for video-capture to start will, without fail, lead me to miss the moment. My trusty Swiss Army knife is still at the ready for when I take my family on vacation. But I’ll probably take my Flip along, too. Cisco may have had reasons to kill Flip, but the smartphone was not one of them.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26cable.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Atop TV Sets, Cable Boxes and DVRs Drain Power<date>Published: June 25, 2011</date><text>Those little boxes that usher cable signals and digital recording capacity into televisions have become the single largest electricity drain in many American homes, with some typical home entertainment configurations eating more power than a new refrigerator and even some central air-conditioning systems.There are 160 million so-called set-top boxes in the United States, one for every two people, and that number is rising. Many homes now have one or more basic cable boxes as well as add-on DVRs, or digital video recorders, which use 40 percent more power than the set-top box. One high-definition DVR and one high-definition cable box use an average of 446 kilowatt hours a year, about 10 percent more than a 21-cubic-foot energy-efficient refrigerator, a recent study found. These set-top boxes are energy hogs mostly because their drives, tuners and other components are generally running full tilt, or nearly so, 24 hours a day, even when not in active use. The recent study, by the Natural Resources Defense Council, concluded that the boxes consumed $3 billion in electricity per year in the United States — and that 66 percent of that power is wasted when no one is watching and shows are not being recorded. That is more power than the state of Maryland uses over 12 months. “People in the energy efficiency community worry a lot about these boxes, since they will make it more difficult to lower home energy use,” said John Wilson, a former member of the California Energy Commission who is now with the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. “Companies say it can’t be done or it’s too expensive. But in my experience, neither one is true. It can be done, and it often doesn’t cost much, if anything.” The perpetually “powered on” state is largely a function of design and programming choices made by electronics companies and cable and Internet providers, which are related to the way cable networks function in the United States. Fixes exist, but they are not currently being mandated or deployed in the United States, critics say. Similar devices in some European countries, for example, can automatically go into standby mode when not in use, cutting power drawn by half. They can also go into an optional “deep sleep,” which can reduce energy consumption by about 95 percent compared with when the machine is active. One British company, Pace, sells such boxes to American providers, who do not take advantage of the reduced energy options because of worries that the lowest energy states could disrupt service. Cable companies say customers will not tolerate the time it takes to reboot the system once the system has been shut down or put to sleep. “The issue of having more efficient equipment is of interest to us,” said Justin Venech, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable. But, he added, “when we purchase the equipment, functionality and cost are the primary considerations.” But energy efficiency experts say that technical fixes could eliminate or minimize the waiting time and inconvenience, some at little expense. Low-energy European systems reboot from deep sleep in one to two minutes. Alan Meier, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said of the industry in the United States, “I don’t want to use the word ‘lazy,’ but they have had different priorities, and saving energy is not one of them.” The Environmental Protection Agency has established Energy Star standards for set-top boxes and has plans to tighten them significantly by 2013, said Ann Bailey, director of Energy Star product labeling, in an e-mail. The voluntary seal indicates products that use energy efficiently. But today, there are many boxes on the list of products that meet the Energy Star standard that do not offer an automatic standby or sleep mode. “If you hit the on/off button it only dims the clock, it doesn’t significantly reduce power use,” said Noah Horowitz, senior scientist at the natural resources council. Energy efficiency is a function of hardware, software, the cable network and how a customer uses the service, said Robert Turner, an engineer at Pace, which makes set-top boxes that can operate using less power while not in active use. Sometimes energy efficiency can be vastly improved by remotely adjusting software over a cable, Mr. Turner said. In this way, Pace reduced the energy consumption of some of its older boxes by half. Cable boxes are not designed to be turned completely off, and even when in deep sleep mode, it takes time to reconnect and “talk” with their cable or satellite network, though that time is highly variable depending on the technology. 1 2 Next Page »Those little boxes that usher cable signals and digital recording capacity into televisions have become the single largest electricity drain in many American homes, with some typical home entertainment configurations eating more power than a new refrigerator and even some central air-conditioning systems.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/barclays-names-co-heads-for-tech-m-a/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Barclays Names Co-Heads for Tech M.&amp;A.<date>June 6, 2011, 6:43 pm</date><text>Barclays Capital has promoted Greg Dalvito and Richard Hardegree to be the firm’s co-heads of technology mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Dalvito will be based in New York while Mr. Hardegree will be based in Menlo Park, Calif, according to an internal memo sent on Monday by Paul Parker, the firm’s global mergers and acquisitions chief. As the head of Barclays’ media team, Mr. Dalvito managed several billion-dollar transactions, including the $6 billion sale of Vivendi’s stake in NBC Universal. Mr. Hardegree, who has spent more than a decade with the technology team, has advised several blue-chip clients, like Cisco and AMD. Additionally, the company also announced on Monday, that it has promoted Barry Boniface, to be the head of its communications and media mergers and acquisitions group. The appointments come just one month after Barclays’ former head of technology mergers and acquisitions, Drago Rajkovic, left for a rival, JPMorgan Chase. In recent months, there have been several notable shuffles, as investment banks try to attract and retain the best talent. Last week, UBS hired Yusuf Nahmiyas as a managing director for its technology, media and telecommunications mergers team. He was most recently at Deutsche Bank. In April, Citigroup tapped Ethan Topper, the founder of the boutique investment bank Union Square Advisors and a former Credit Suisse banker, to be its global head of technology banking. The announcement was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. Here is the internal memo from Mr. Parker to his staff: As part of our further expansion of the Technology franchise, we are pleased to announce the appointment of Greg Dalvito and Richard Hardegree to Co-Heads of the M&amp;A Technology vertical. Both Greg and Richard bring extensive relevant experience to their new leadership roles. Greg and Richard will be based in New York and Menlo Park, respectively, and their coverage will span the various sub-sectors within the Technology vertical. Greg has headed our Media M&amp;A vertical for nearly five years. Greg’s recent and historical experience in media, telecom and technology has allowed him to advise on many franchise-defining transactions in those sectors. He has executed over $400bn in completed advisory assignments, including most recently advising Mediacom’s Special Committee in the $3.9bn take-private transaction, Vivendi in the sale of its $6bn stake in NBC Universal and Scripps in the $1.0bn acquisition of The Travel Channel. In addition to Greg’s new responsibilities, Greg will continue to work with and advise a number of our most important media clients. Richard has focused on technology M&amp;A in Menlo Park since 1999 and has spent the last 5 years as a senior member of our technology M&amp;A team. Over this time, he has established strong relationships in the electronics and communications technology sectors and has advised on over 50 technology transactions with clients, including Cisco, AMD, Nokia Siemens Networks, Avago and KLA Tencor. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that Barry Boniface has been appointed to Head of the Communications and Media M&amp;A vertical, supplementing his current leadership role in the Communications M&amp;A vertical. Barry has over 20 years of relevant industry experience and has been Chairman and Head of the Communications M&amp;A vertical for 4 years. He has advised clients on numerous high-profile transactions, including CenturyLink’s acquisition of Qwest, Sprint’s WiMAX JV with Clearwire, Verizon’s divestiture of its rural access lines to Frontier, AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Centennial as well as leading BellSouth’s $90bn merger with AT&amp;T and Cingular’s $46bn acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless. Please join us in congratulating Barry, Greg and Richard on their new roles going forward.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/flipping-to-grilled-cheese/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Flipping to Grilled Cheese<date>June 2, 2011, 2:57 pm</date><text>This spring, I taught a course at the Columbia Business School called, “Consumer Tech: What Makes a Hit a Hit, and a Flop a Flop.” It was supposed to be half lectures, half guest speakers. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. Sign up | See Sample The creator of the Flip camcorder plans to open 500 grilled-cheese-and-soup restaurants by 2015. One of my speakers was Jonathan Kaplan, founder and chief executive of Pure Digital. That’s the company that made the wildly successful Flip camcorders, the company that Cisco bought two years ago for $590 million, the company that Cisco then shut down last month, without any reasonable explanation. The world was astonished. But the person I figured would feel it in most in the gut was Mr. Kaplan, who had to watch his baby killed by the corporate parent who’d promised to raise it. As fate would have it, his visit to my classroom came just a week later. My students and I were itching to hear what he had to say. He was funny, moving, and insightful. I took notes, which I thought I’d share with you now. First, he addressed the common wisdom that smartphones killed the Flip. Who’d buy a Flip if your phone can take video? “I don’t think the smartphone was really at all involved,” said Mr. Kaplan (which also happens to be my point of view). “Cameraphones haven’t stopped over 35 million cameras a year from being sold in the U.S.” The Flip, he said, was very profitable at Cisco; it took in $500 million the first year. So why did Cisco kill it? He pointed out that Cisco’s stock had crashed for the first time in years, and guessed that Cisco’s shareholders wanted the company to focus on its core business (which is not consumer electronics). So why didn’t Cisco sell Flip instead of killing it? Kaplan’s speculation: First, because Cisco was using Flip’s technology in other products, and it might have been very complicated to disentangle it. Second, he imagines that Wall Street might not react well if, after all the expenses of selling and disentangling the Flip, the sale price weren’t very impressive. “And remember, this is a company with $45 billion in revenue,” he pointed out. “Who cares if you sell the Flip for $200 or $500 million? It’s just not worth it. And there are probably some tax benefits to not selling it.” So Cisco just killed a beloved, profitable product. “Is that fair to us? To the consumer? To the world? Probably not. But if Cisco manages to turn itself around, and the share prices go up, everyone will say that it was a really good decision,” Mr. Kaplan said. He mentioned that LG, Amazon, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and Kodak all tried to buy Pure Digital. You have to wonder now where the Flip would be if one of those companies had been the victor instead of Cisco. As it is now, though, “there’s a greater than 95 percent chance that five years from now, nobody will know what the Flip was.” Mr. Kaplan also gave us a few lessons from his life as a serial entrepreneur. * “It’s not about the hour, day, week; it’s about the month, quarter, year.” * “It’s better to be happy than to be right. (It’s hard for driven people to realize this.)” * “Say thank you.” * “Anything is possible.” Everybody told Mr. Kaplan that the Flip was a terrible idea. He had trouble getting investment capital. But entrepreneurs have to be dogged and passionate. “It’s like going into a bar filled with 100 beautiful women. You ask the first one, ‘Will you go out with me?’ And she says no. You ask the second one out, and she pours her drink on you. The third one slaps you. Well, most people would give up at beautiful woman No. 2 or No. 3. An entrepreneur is the one who gets all the way to No. 100. And marries her and lives happily ever after.” * “Most people think the way you figure that out is doing a focus group. But the really really successful ones are ones people never thought they wanted. Figure out a way to delight the consumer; You need to figure out what it is. Then use the focus group to see if you’re crazy.” * “Simple is hard.” * “The product’s name is really important. If we’d called it Zeezo, it would have failed.” Pure Digital hired a naming company that generated thousands of nonsensical names “like Vaio. What’s Vaio mean!?” Ultimately, Mr. Kaplan came up with the name Flip while fooling with his Audi keychain, popping out the spring-loaded key from the fob. * “If you hire someone bad, fire them immediately and give them a big severance package so they feel good about you. We gave our workers four to six months’ severance, even if they’d worked only four months. You might think that’s crazy. But it was our mistake to hire that person. And it’s not that much money, really.” In fact, Mr. Kaplan said to my classroom full of future executives, “You have to be willing to fire people. I’ve been fired three times. You’ll all probably get fired. If you’re a passionate person, you will get fired. But you’ll both be better off parting ways.” So what about the future? “I get an e-mail a week from investment bankers asking me to resuscitate Flip,” he said. But he’s not going there. Instead, he told us, he intends to launch a new venture, one that embraces “all the same tenets as the Flip: Simple, nostalgic, memorable, affordable.” But he left us all hanging without telling us what it was. Yesterday, he unveiled his new company. What do you supposed the creator of the Flip camcorder does for an encore? He founds a chain of grilled-cheese-and-soup restaurants. That’s right. He plans to open five The Melt restaurants around San Francisco this year, then 500 more nationwide by 2015. You’ll order online or from your phone; you’ll be sent a QR barcode, which you hold up to a scanner when you arrive at the restaurant. Your sandwich and soup combo ($8) will be ready in one minute. They’re upscale grilled-cheese; the combos will include “aged gruyere on wheat with wild mushroom soup,” he says, or “goat cheese and mint with carrot ginger soup.” With each visit, you’ll be asked if you’d like to round up your purchase price to the nearest dollar, with the difference donated to a charity dedicated to fighting world hunger. It sure sounds—unusual. But if the industry has learned anything from the dearly departed Flip, it’s that it’s not wise to bet against Jonathan Kaplan.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/technology/23cisco.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Suit Says Cisco Helped China Pursue Falun Gong<date>Published: May 22, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Cisco, the maker of Internet routing gear, customized its technology to help China track members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, according to a federal lawsuit filed last week by members of the movement. The lawsuit, which relies on internal sales materials, also said that Cisco had tried to market its equipment to the Chinese government by using inflammatory language that stemmed from the Maoist Cultural Revolution. The suit was filed Thursday in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose by the Human Rights Law Foundation on behalf of members of Falun Gong. It contends that Cisco helped design the controversial “Golden Shield” firewall that is used to censor the Internet and track opponents of the Chinese government. The lawsuit names several Cisco executives, including the chairman and chief executive, John T. Chambers. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and to enjoin Cisco from unlawful activity. When evidence of the company’s activities in China became public in 2004, in the book "Losing the New China: A Story of American Commerce, Desire and Betrayal," by Ethan Gutmann, Cisco disassociated itself from the marketing materials, stating that they were the work of a low-level employee. On Friday the company said in a statement that there was “no basis” for the allegations and that it intended to “vigorously” defend itself. “Cisco does not operate networks in China or elsewhere, nor does Cisco customize our products in any way that would facilitate censorship or repression,” the company stated. The suit claims that additional Cisco marketing presentations prove that it promoted its technology as being capable of taking aim at dissident groups. In one marketing slide, the goals of the Golden Shield are described as to “douzheng evil Falun Gong cult and other hostile elements.” Douzheng is a Chinese term used to describe the persecution of undesirable groups. It was widely used by the Communist Party in the Cultural Revolution. The 52-page lawsuit describes the Golden Shield as a system intended to censor Internet traffic flowing into China, and to identify and monitor opponents of the Chinese government. The suit states that Falun Gong members who used the Internet were tracked by the Golden Shield and then apprehended. Members of the group who were arrested were tortured, and one member was beaten to death, the lawsuit says. Another plaintiff who was arrested has since vanished, the suit claims, and is presumed to be dead. The lawsuit challenges Cisco’s assertion that it did not help design the firewall system or customize technology that it sold to meet government surveillance and censorship requirements. Terri Marsh, a lawyer for the Human Rights Law Foundation in Washington, said the group had compiled detailed information about Cisco’s role in the design of Chinese information centers that host Falun Gong database applications connected to network surveillance and tracking systems. This information will be disclosed in court during the discovery phase of the trial, Ms. Marsh said. The lawsuit states that other documents lay out design suggestions to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security on how to pursue dissidents effectively. The lawsuit is based on the Alien Torts Statute, a federal law that permits foreign nationals to bring lawsuits in United States federal court claiming violations of international law. They also have brought charges under the Torture Victim Protection Act and under California state law. The suit names three Falun Gong members, Ivy He, of Canada; Liu Guifu, of New York State; and Charles Lee, an American citizen who was arrested when he went to China in 2003 and was held until 2006. It also is brought on behalf of eight unidentified Chinese citizens, who include those who were tortured and killed or are missing.

For more than a decade, both have run dominant, rapidly maturing tech juggernauts — Mr. Chambers at Cisco Systems and Mr. Ballmer at Microsoft. And both have let down their shareholders. The difference is that one seems to have recognized the error of his ways and is repenting.After years of frittering away Cisco’s cash on acquisitions and overpriced stock buybacks, Mr. Chambers has gotten religion. He is paring back the company to focus on its core networking businesses and streamlining management ranks. As he said on Wednesday, “We have acknowledged our challenges. We know what we have to do.” Cisco has instituted a dividend. And if he can resist more of the shopping excursions that led him to spend $34 billion in the last decade, he may even manage to kick-start his stock after 10 years of directionless returns. Compare that with Mr. Ballmer. A day before Cisco released its third-quarter results, Microsoft agreed to spend $8.5 billion on Skype. Without a serious financial rationale for the purchase of the Internet telephone company at 10 times sales, Microsoft took another leap into what Cisco’s Mr. Chambers used to call “market adjacencies.” There may be some Skype synergy with Microsoft’s many products. But they are fuzzy, in the same way that Cisco’s lurch into the consumer business with the acquisition of cable set-top boxes and handheld video cameras was. So what has made Mr. Chambers see the light, while Mr. Ballmer continues building an empire of adjacencies? After all, Microsoft’s stock has underperformed Cisco’s over the last 10 years. It is down more than 25 percent, three times the drop in Cisco’s stock — though admittedly Mr. Ballmer instituted dividends years ago, which has made the total return less disappointing for investors. One simple explanation lies in the shareholder base. Mr. Chambers’s decision to revamp the company came with activist investors circling. With no single major shareholder to protect him, Mr. Chambers grasped the risks of inaction. Microsoft’s ownership, by contrast, is still dominated by its chairman and co-founder, Bill Gates. He and Mr. Ballmer own about $20 billion of Microsoft stock, giving them a combined stake bigger than 10 percent — something no outside investor could amass. With insulation like that, it’s no surprise Mr. Ballmer is still able to run amok. Booming Exports Has the global economy hit a soft patch? A week after a sell-off skimmed froth from bubbly commodities markets, China reported a tiny decline in inflation. But any impression that the global economy is cooling, and the conclusion that monetary policy tightening can be deferred, is wrong. Inflationary pressures still need to be checked. China’s annual rate of inflation moderated to 5.3 percent in April, from 5.4 percent the month before. But that is still very high, and inflationary forces are plain to see. Wages in China are widely reported to be rising at double-digit rates. The country’s currency is appreciating at only a slow pace against the dollar. The latest huge trade surplus suggests foreign exchange reserves will keep booming, and with them the money supply. Record export figures provide further confirmation that the global recovery is firmly on track. China’s exports were up a staggering 29.9 percent in April from a year earlier. Meanwhile, exports out of Germany were up by 19.9 percent in March compared with a year earlier. They are also well above the record set in April 2008. Rapid export growth is adding to inflationary pressure in Germany, too. German consumers are spending and inflation has jumped to 2.7 percent. Price increases in the euro zone over all are also heading toward 3 percent. The European Central Bank will need to raise interest rates. It cannot afford to let inflation soar in the core economies of the region despite the troubles of some peripheral member states. Investors and some policy makers keep seeing soft patches in the worldwide recovery. The reality is that limited monetary policy tightening by a few central banks hasn’t checked global growth much. The German and Chinese export booms ought to be echoing loudly worldwide. Interest rates in most economies remain negative in real terms. The mix of strong demand and easy money suggests higher rates will be needed to prevent commodities flying again and inflation soaring. The hard data doesn’t look so soft at all.John Chambers and Steve Ballmer have much in common.

Now the company is telling us. It has announced two important deadlines for Flip video camera owners if they want to keep and share their movies. One is coming up fast, and the other is a little further out. The Flip video camera. Here is the nearer deadline: Cisco has put a 30-day expiration date on videos and photos stored on FlipShare’s Web service. Starting May 12, videos will expire 30 days after being loaded. Cisco doesn’t say explicitly what happens after 30 days, but presumably they will be erased. This  also applies to videos that have been posted before May 12, so you have about a month to rescue all of those videos you have archived on FlipShare. There is a step-by-step explanation of how to move your videos from the Web to your computer here, on the Flip Web site. Flip videos that you share to Facebook and YouTube aren’t subject to expiration. Cisco said it would still provide technical support to the cameras until the FlipShare expiration date, Dec.  31, 2013. Cisco will, however, continue to provide the FlipShare video-sharing service for two and a half years. So you have two and a half years to find a new favorite video camera.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/technology/12cisco.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco Profit Falls, but Beats Forecast<date>Published: May 11, 2011</date><text>Cisco Systems’ streak of lackluster earnings continued on Wednesday as the company failed to invigorate its slow-growing business. The mixed results come as John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, forges ahead with an overhaul meant to combat sluggish decision-making while focusing the company on its core computer networking business. But the turnaround, which started last month, is expected to take a while. Mr. Chambers said that he planned to cut an unspecified number of jobs and potentially eliminate or scale back additional products to lift Cisco’s growth. With about 73,000 employees, the company has already eliminated 550 jobs, offered employee buyouts and killed the Flip video camera as part of his month-old turnaround plan. Mr. Chambers is trying to reassure Wall Street that he is moving quickly to fix Cisco, the computer-networking colossus. Bureaucracy, a lack of innovation and stiff competition have wounded the company, a one-time technology industry high flier. “We know what we have to do,” Mr. Chambers told analysts in a conference call on Wednesday. “We have a clear game plan. We are a company with a track record.” Cisco’s reported net income in the fiscal third quarter fell 18 percent to $1.8 billion, or 33 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 37 cents, in the year-ago quarter. The company, which sells routers and switches that direct Internet traffic, said revenue climbed 5 percent, to $10.9 billion, from $10.4 billion. The adjusted income of 42 cents was above the low expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 37 cents a share and revenue of $10.86 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. The additional details about his turnaround plan, along with a tepid forecast, failed to reassure investors. Cisco’s shares fell 2.9 percent, to $17.26, in after-hours trading. Cisco’s shares are down more than 30 percent over the last 12 months because of the slow growth. At the same time, the Nasdaq composite rose nearly 20 percent. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be flat or gain 2 percent, the company said. Adjusted income will be 37 to 39 cents, lower than the 42 cents that analysts had expected. In a sign of its continuing troubles, Cisco said that sales of switches during the quarter fell 9 percent, but that sales of routers rose 7 percent. Sales of corporate phone systems and videoconferencing, however, increased 39 percent while wireless products rose 32 percent. Cisco is facing stiff competition from companies like Juniper Networks and Alcatel-Lucent for corporate customers, including telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities. Spending by government agencies was particularly weak for Cisco, declining 8 percent in the quarter. “It’s a company that has pockets of weakness, but it also has pockets of strength,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Financial. Cisco faces additional pressure because of evolving markets and a failure to adapt. Many networking products are now specialized based on the kind of customer, a development that Cisco was late to embrace. In an effort to reverse the slide, Mr. Chambers has begun a series of changes intended to focus Cisco on its core products. He has scaled back the company’s consumer division, which included the Flip video camera, but others may be affected. Cisco said that it expected to save $1 billion over the next 12 months from its job cuts and streamlining.  Last week, Mr. Chambers said he would take additional steps to streamline Cisco by revamping its complex management structure, which had executives serving on a patchwork of “councils.” Instead of encouraging cooperation, the councils created additional bureaucracy. But the turnaround is expected to take time. Indeed, details of the coming job cuts, which will affect both employees and contractors, will not be disclosed until the end of summer, the company said.Cisco Systems’ streak of lackluster earnings continued on Wednesday as the company failed to invigorate its slow-growing business.

Chambers, one of the best salesmen in Silicon Valley, has been having trouble selling anyone on his company’s future.Cisco Systems, where he is chief executive, is in a slump. The management system he put in place slowed decision-making and innovation. The company’s growth has slowed and its profits are falling. His latest sales pitch is that he can revive Cisco — a technology colossus that makes computer networking equipment — by pruning its sprawling business and refocusing on its strengths. But investors, Wall Street analysts and customers are a little bit skeptical of Mr. Chambers’s promises. No major improvement in Cisco’s finances is expected when it reports third quarter earnings on Wednesday.  Given Cisco’s size, the scope of the overhaul and the increasing competition that is eroding the company’s market share, a turnaround could take time. Last week, Cisco said it would reduce bureaucracy by eliminating a crazy-quilt management structure that had executives responsible for geographic regions as well as serving on “councils” that were supposed to encourage cooperation between the different groups. Instead, it slowed decision-making.   Last month, Mr. Chambers, who declined to be interviewed for this article, took his first step to fix Cisco by suddenly shutting down its Flip video camera business. Only two years earlier, Cisco had acquired Flip’s parent company for $590 million to expand its nascent consumer products division. The camera was popular and, indeed, the company was days away from release of the latest version of the video camera. “This isn’t simply a midcourse correction,” said Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst with Barclays Capital. “They’re facing challenges that are multi-year.” The doubt in Mr. Chambers’s sales pitch began last year when Cisco’s sales started to show weakness that Mr. Chambers initially attributed to the sour economy. When profits continued to wither quarter after quarter, Mr. Chambers alternately blamed a decline in government spending and a “transition” after the introduction of new switches for computer networks. In the last 12 months, its shares have fallen 31 percent as the Nasdaq index gained 22 percent. While Cisco’s shares fell, those of its rivals like Juniper Networks rose 35 percent. Alcatel-Lucent’s shares doubled. In April, in a memo to employees, Mr. Chambers acknowledged systematic problems at Cisco. He blamed slow decision-making and a lack of accountability. “We have disappointed our investors and we have confused our employees,” Mr. Chambers wrote. “Bottom line, we have lost some of the credibility that is foundational to Cisco’s success — and we must earn it back.” The contrition is unusual for Mr. Chambers, who is known for his unwavering optimism during his 16 years leading Cisco. He has paused his cheerleading only once before — during the dot-com crash more than a decade ago, when Cisco was unprepared for customers sharply cutting back orders. Cisco had been one of the hottest companies of the Internet boom of the 1990s with a high-flying stock to match. Much of the blame for its shortcomings fell on Mr. Chambers, much as it does today. The last few years should have been golden for Cisco. Telecommunications companies worldwide were rapidly expanding their infrastructure to accommodate growing traffic from online streaming and mobile phones. But Cisco failed to keep pace with changes in the network switching and routing equipment, which accounts for nearly half its revenue. The industry has shifted from more standardized technology — a landscape in which Cisco thrived — to specialized equipment for various niche markets. For example, Cisco’s market share in edge routers, used by Internet providers to route traffic near the edges of their networks, dropped 11 percentage points over three years to 42.2 percent in 2010, according to the Dell’Oro Group, a market research firm. “They’ve been lagging,” said Shin Umeda, an analyst with the Dell’Oro Group. “As a result, the competitors have been able to move in.” 1 2 Next Page »SAN FRANCISCO — John T.

I love FaceTime on my iPad. But how do I set up a conference call? A. FaceTime, Apple’s video chat software, allows you to see and talk to people using the software on the iPad 2, Mac computers, the iPhone 4 and the fourth-generation iPod Touch. However, in the current version of the FaceTime program, you can only conduct a video chat with one other person at a time. Apple may eventually add group videoconferencing to FaceTime, but some app makers are experimenting independently. At least one company, Fring, is testing a new version of its videochat app for iOS and Android devices that allows four people to participate on one call. It should be available next week. Cisco’s WebEx videoconferencing system has an iPad app that says it supports two-way video chat with multiple participants. The app is free, but you need to sign up for WebEx service to use it—plans include a $49 monthly subscription and a pay-per-use fee of 33 cents a minute; a free two-week trial is also available. If you need to conduct a video conference call and are not tied to the iPad, you have a few options with desktop programs. Among them, Skype and Apple’s own iChat program for Macs allow multiple participants in the video-chat room.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/technology/18place.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Consumer Markets Bewilder Enterprise Companies<date>Published: April 17, 2011</date><text>IF Apple can do it, why can’t we?That’s a question the Ciscos of the world — big technology companies that sell stuff to businesses, but lack “ooh-ah” consumer products like iPads — never stop asking. One obvious answer, of course, is this: Because you’re not Apple. Not only that, you are not a consumer company. You never have been. The record of powerful companies charging into the consumer marketplace, only to retreat in humiliation later, is long and distinguished. Cisco’s announcement last week that it would shut its Flip video camera division, two years after buying Flip for $590 million, is just the latest chapter in a story that could be titled “The Consumer Marketplace: Destroyer of Dreams.” So why try? For starters, the stock market rewards sexy consumer products. Their makers are not just companies — they become cultural movements. Apple’s stock trades at a price of about 18.5 times earnings per share, Cisco Systems at 13 times. No one ever waited in line to buy a Cisco networking solution. Cisco’s share price fell about 3.5 percent last week; it is down almost 16 percent so far this year. “To enterprise companies, the consumer market is the Afghanistan of business,” said Andrew Zolli, consultant and director of the PopTech, an annual technology conference. “Lots of companies take a turn there and no one leaves satisfied — and they all leave eventually.” Cisco came as ready for the challenge as any predecessor. It dominates the complex and demanding world of digital networking; in under 30 years, it has grown to be one of the largest companies in the world, with a market capitalization larger than Goldman Sachs, McDonald’s or Ford. At the time it acquired Flip, Cisco was said to have cash reserves of more than $29 billion. But surely Cisco must have seen that the road to the consumer market is paved with the corpses of the fallen. In 1995, for instance, the computer modem maker U.S. Robotics bought Palm, the maker of personal digital assistants. In the ensuing years, Palm was passed from U.S. Robotics to its new parent, 3Com, and then to its current owner, Hewlett-Packard. In the meantime, Palm, once a market leader, watched competitors like Apple, Google and Research In Motion carve up the smartphone market. As Cisco hoped in its acquisition of Flip, each of Palm’s parents hoped that the smaller company’s innovations would bring fame and fortune to the entire organization. The parent company would no longer just be a business — it would be a brand. Its executives would be minor (or even major) celebrities. Perhaps the stock price would get a healthy bump. “It’s a little tough when all the money and energy is over in the consumer space,” said an industry analyst, Mark Anderson. “If you’re on the enterprise side of things, you want some of that.” I.B.M. was perhaps the most successful crossover artist, moving from mainframe to personal computing with the PC in the early 1980s. But even that success was the exception that proves the rule. I.B.M. had to set up an autonomous division in Florida, far from corporate headquarters in New York, to give the PC room to grow. “The only way the PC was going to be developed was if it got out from under I.B.M.’s bureaucracy,” said the business historian John Steele Gordon. “That the PC succeeded at all was not because of I.B.M.’s corporate culture, but in spite of it.” (It is worth noting that Microsoft’s Xbox was developed in a similar fashion.) Even I.B.M.’s move into the consumer space came to an end. The computing giant sold its PC group to Lenovo in 2005. Acquiring or building a consumer business and successfully integrating it into the larger, existing enterprise company is challenging, says Mr. Zolli, the consultant. “Companies acquire consumer businesses for perceived synergies,” he said. “But the synergies are almost always illusory. These corporate marriages bring all the emotional baggage of a shotgun wedding.” In 2008, Microsoft bought Danger, a small company that made a cellphone called the Sidekick. The Sidekick had already attained an enviable level of popularity in the much sought-after youth market. Microsoft integrated the Danger team into the group developing the Kin, a Sidekick-like device that Microsoft was hoping would have the same appeal to teenagers and young adults. The Kin was released in May of last year; 48 days later, Microsoft removed it from the market, a remarkably public admission of failure. 1 2 Next Page »IF Apple can do it, why can’t we?</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/technology/13flip.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco Shuts Down Flip, Its Video Camera Unit<date>Published: April 12, 2011</date><text>It was one of the great tech start-up success stories of the last decade.The Flip video camera, conceived by a few entrepreneurs in an office above Gump’s department store in San Francisco, went on sale in 2007, and quickly dominated the camcorder market.

Even in the life cycle of the tech world, this is fast. From the outset, the acquisition was an odd fit for Cisco, which is known for its enterprise networking services. To some analysts, the decision to shutter Flip was an admission by Cisco that it made a mistake. “Cisco was swayed by the sexiness of selling to the consumer,” said Mo Koyfman, a principal at Spark Capital, a Boston venture capital firm. “They’re not wired to do it themselves, so they do it by acquisition. Flip was one of the most visible targets out there. But it’s really hard to turn an elephant into a horse. Cisco’s an elephant.” But the rapid rise, and now demise, of Flip is also a vivid illustration of the ferocious metabolism of the consumer marketplace and of the smartphone’s power to destroy other gadgets. “It was unusually fast,” said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. “It’s a testament to the pace of innovation in consumer electronics and smartphone technology. More and more functionality is being integrated into smartphones.” The rapid innovation of smartphones, he said, is “one of the most disruptive trends we’ve seen.” As newer and faster technologies beget newer and faster technologies, consumers move on to the next big thing with alacrity. In four years, Flip has gone from start-up, to dominant camcorder maker, to defunct. It took I.B.M. about four years just to reach dominance with its PC in the early 1980s. The iPad is only one year old. Just as the Flip was reaching its zenith, the smartphone was gaining traction among consumers. With its versatility in recording video and still images, as well as its ability to perform myriad other functions, the smartphone has since proved to be a far more desirable product than a single-function device like the Flip. At the same time, the smartphone has crushed the market for GPS devices, put a serious dent in the point-and-shoot camera industry and threatens the existence of many other everyday devices — the wristwatch, the alarm clock and the portable music player. For technology entrepreneurs, the Flip story may be a cautionary tale of another sort. Many entrepreneurs look at Facebook’s ability to rebuff suitors as an inspiration to stay independent. But Flip’s founders were paid more than half a billion dollars for their invention from one of the most deep-pocketed companies in Silicon Valley, offering an alternate lesson in the fine art of cashing out at the right time. “There are a lot of young entrepreneurs who look at Flip as a huge success, and they should continue to,” said Jonathan Kaplan, a co-founder and former chief executive of the start-up that invented the Flip. “The demise of Flip has nothing to do with how great a product it is. Companies have to make decisions that sometimes people like you and I don’t always understand.” Cisco said its decision to shut down the Flip division was part of an overall restructuring plan of its consumer business. “We are making key, targeted moves as we align operations in support of our network-centric platform strategy,” said John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, in a statement. Cisco had made inroads into the consumer market over the last decade by purchasing Pure Digital Technologies, maker of the Flip, as well as Linksys, the home-network router manufacturer. Mr. Chambers embodied the exuberance for consumer products, saying he owned eight Flip devices. The company declined to elaborate on its reasons for shutting the Flip division, but it has faced mounting pressure to shore up its profit margins. It remains the top-selling camcorder on Amazon today, and inspired many imitators. Existing camera heavyweights like Sony and Kodak rushed to release their own Flip-like camcorders, trying to chase Flip’s runaway sales. Still, Flip’s luster began to fade, as a spate of smartphones with built-in cameras and editing applications hit the market. The unit, which sells cameras for $100 to $200, also struggled to match the rich margins of Cisco’s enterprise services, Mr. Bracelin said. In another sign of trouble, Mr. Kaplan, who became Cisco’s general manager of consumer products after Cisco acquired Pure Digital, left the company in February. Several analysts saw the decision as an inevitable consequence of a mistake. “I don’t think there’s an analyst on the planet who thought that Flip was a good acquisition,” said Alex Henderson, an analyst with Miller Tabak &amp; Company. “Cisco had this idea that they wanted to be in the consumer’s home network, but they had a grand vision that was not grounded in reality.” Stephen Baker, an analyst with NPD Group, “Cisco was never really committed to the product.” Although the company never disclosed specific numbers on Flip, analysts estimated it accounted for a fraction of the Cisco’s business. Simon Leopold, an analyst with Morgan, Keegan &amp; Company, said Flip probably had about $400 million in annual revenue, compared with roughly $40 billion for Cisco over all. Cisco said that the changes would result in 550 layoffs and a pretax charge of less than $300 million in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Verne G.

Now he’s putting some money where his mouth is and shutting parts of the overextended networking company’s shrinking consumer business. That’s sensible as far it goes. More will be needed to simplify Cisco’s sprawl and improve shareholder returns.The company’s expansion into consumer markets has always looked like mission creep. The purchase of the maker of Flip video cameras for $590 million in 2009 was emblematic of the problem. Cisco justified the deal at the time as “key to Cisco’s strategy to expand our momentum in the media-enabled home and to capture the consumer market transition to visual networking.” But it was never clear why a company that had been enormously successful in delivering advanced, expensive networking gear for the corporate market should spend heavily to move into producing cheap gadgets for consumers. Now, it’s shutting Flip, and expects to take a $300 million charge. That’s bitter, but medicine often is. The company still needs to take additional steps. It has spent the last decade plowing profits into low-margin businesses only loosely connected with networking and into capital-destroying stock buybacks. The shares have lost more than half their value since the start of 2001. This poor capital allocation has frustrated investors and made Cisco difficult to manage, as Mr. Chambers admitted last week. And it may have caused the company to take its eye off the ball in core markets like switching, where sales fell 8 percent in the last quarter. Mr. Chambers is approaching retirement age. If he wants to hand a sound company over to his successor and not be chased out by investors tired of the last decade’s turmoil, Cisco needs to be simpler still. Redoubling efforts in networking while whittling down the more than two dozen “market adjacencies,” like the security and smart-grids it has been pursuing, would be the next logical step. Trump Card for Gas The attack on natural gas is growing. A new report asserts that the fuel source is worse for global warming than coal. It’s the latest strike against its green credentials. But unlike coal producers, gas producers have the technology to capture the emissions. The industry should strike back by embracing tougher standards if it wants to win the fight for market share. The notion that gas is the cleanest fossil fuel has been losing steam. A series of recent studies suggests that the industry may be spoiling ground water and dredging up radioactive materials. But its proudest claim, of emitting about half as much greenhouse gas as coal, has held firm. Now that has been called into question by academics at Cornell. The report highlights a real worry. Gas extraction can cause leaks of methane, which is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat. At their most careless, gas firms may be a fifth worse for global warming than coal. But this tells only half the story. Gas producers already have the means to eliminate the bulk of these emissions. Voluntary standards from the Environmental Protection Agency helped the industry capture the equivalent of 35 million metric tons of CO2, the same as planting seven million acres of forest. Better still, sales of trapped methane were worth $344 million in 2009. Just over half the gas companies in the United States have signed up for the program. It would help if they set aside their distaste for regulation and accept the rules as mandatory for all. It’s an advantage worth exploiting. Coal has fewer immediate options for self-improvement. Despite generous government help, carbon capture for coal has yet to be tested on a large scale and could raise the cost of electricity by as much as 80 percent, according to the Energy Department. Without a price on carbon, such technology would not be widely adopted. Environmental awareness helps explain why gas has increased its share of electricity generation to 24 percent, up from 17 percent, over the last decade. To keep it up, the gas lobby can’t afford to lose its greenhouse gas trump card. ROBERT CYRAN and CHRISTOPHER SWANNCisco’s chief executive, John Chambers, acknowledged last week that the company he has run for 16 years had lost its way.

Cisco Systems — which heralded the $590 million purchase of Pure Digital Technologies two years ago — is closing the company, which makes Flip video cameras, as part of a broader effort to restructure its consumer business. In March 2009, Cisco was optimistic about the prospects for Pure Digital. At the time, the enterprise networking services company was rapidly expanding into consumer products, investing in set-top boxes, digital stereos and personal video. Cisco’s chief executive, John T. Chambers, embodied the exuberance for such goods, saying he owned eight Flip devices. On Tuesday, Cisco announced that it would shutter Flip. The company said it would “exit aspects of its consumer business” and fold the rest into other divisions — effectively dissolving its standalone consumer group. Cisco estimates that the changes will result in 550 layoffs and a pretax charge of less than $300 million in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal year. “We are making key, targeted moves as we align operations in support of our network-centric platform strategy,” Mr. Chambers said in a statement. “As we move forward, our consumer efforts will focus on how we help our enterprise and service provider customers optimize and expand their offerings for consumers.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink According to analysts, Tuesday’s move is an admission by Cisco that it made a mistake and that it paid too much for a company it didn’t really need. “I don’t think there’s an analyst on the planet who thought that Flip was a good acquisition,” said Alex Henderson, an analyst with Miller Tabak &amp; Company. “Cisco had this idea that they wanted to be in the consumer’s home network, but they had a grand vision that was not grounded in reality.” Although the company never disclosed specific numbers on Flip, analysts estimate it was a small fraction of the overall business. Simon Leopold, an analyst with Morgan, Keegan &amp; Company, said Flip likely records about $400 million in annual revenue, compared with roughly $40 billion for Cisco over all. The unit, which sells video cameras for $100 to $200, was also considered a drag on margins. Plus, the business was facing increased competition from traditional camcorder players, like Sony and Panasonic, and mobile handset makers, like Apple, which have started to include high-definition video cameras in their devices. Still, even in Flip’s final months, Cisco tried to push the product. During the holiday shopping season, Cisco was a frequent advertisers, with commercials that showed a variety of users filming “candid” moments. “It’s simply a market they didn’t understand,” Mr. Leopold said. “When times were good, we could look past it.” According to analysts, the fate of Flip could foreshadow more changes at Cisco. Mr. Henderson said the company had not fully addressed the rest of its consumer portfolio and how it would approach such products in the future. “To be blunt, they are not dealing with the fundamental problem — they have a lot of consumer stuff that is basically unprofitable and significantly impairing their profit margins,” he said. “This has been a distraction from their core business and we expect Cisco to take significant steps to get back to basics.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/what-to-do-with-your-flip-now/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">What to Do With Your Flip Now<date>April 12, 2011, 7:12 pm</date><text>Cisco’s announcement on Tuesday that it would stop making its easy-to-use Flip video cameras leaves something like two and a half million buyers wondering, “What now?” All is not lost, although production of cameras ceases. The company said it was working out a transition plan that would determine the fates of repair and support services, as well as FlipShare, Flip’s video-sharing service. First, keep in mind that if your Flip camera works now, you can continue to enjoy using it. The shutdown won’t affect the usefulness of the camera itself. The shutdown may eventually affect FlipShare, but so what? FlipShare, which lets people post and share videos, as well as view them on phones and TVs, may not be a huge loss. You can use a service like YouTube to do just about everything you could do on FlipShare, albeit with a few more steps. FlipShare did have some built-in editing, but most computers come with video-editing software that will do the job, even though (once again) it may require extra steps to import and export the video you want to work on.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/business/06views.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco Shareholders Are Due to Rise Up<date>Published: April 5, 2011</date><text>Cisco Systems makes a juicy target for an activist assault — and the chief executive, John T. Chambers, seems to know it. True, most presumptuous investors don’t have the means to build a significant stake in the $100 billion technology giant. But Cisco’s poor performance, valuable assets, cash pile and years of capital misallocation provide the kindling to spark long-suffering shareholders into an uprising.Indeed, Mr. Chambers, who has been chief executive for 16 years, seems to be bracing for such a possibility. In a 1,500-word e-mail sent to staff members on Monday, he defended his strategy while acknowledging flaws of “operation execution” that have led to a loss of “accountability.” The memo pleads for employees to prepare for “a number of targeted moves” in coming weeks, but offers no concrete solutions to Cisco’s problems. And these are myriad. The former high-flier’s shares have earned a negative return of around 55 percent since the start of 2001. By comparison, the Nasdaq composite gained 13 percent and I.B.M. nearly doubled. Even a fellow misfit, Hewlett-Packard, is in the black. And that’s before accounting for dividends, which Cisco is just beginning to pay. This has come even though Cisco has shoveled money into share buybacks. In the last decade, the firm repurchased $70 billion of shares, paying an average price of more than $20 apiece, Barclays Capital estimates. The stock closed Tuesday at $17.22. Since 2000, the company has also plowed $34 billion into acquisitions, according to Thomson Reuters data. Many of these deals failed to deliver adequate returns and created mission creep away from Cisco’s core business serving the technological needs of big companies. The firm bought the set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta, the home networking group Linksys and the makers of the Flip camera. Those bets haven’t worked out. Sales in Cisco’s consumer division tumbled 15 percent in the most recent quarter. Worse, there are signs that price declines may be starting to outrun volume increases in core businesses like switches, where sales fell 8 percent. As a result, Cisco disappointed investors with a tepid sales forecast in November, and again in February, when it said gross margins shrank. Cisco can improve its fortunes. It controls about two-thirds of the market for switches and routers. Cisco doesn’t break out the figures, but its operating margin last year was 23 percent, or about twice as high as at H.P.’s servers and storage unit and four times as high as those of many consumer electronics companies. It should stop funneling those dollars into highly competitive — and lower margin — businesses. Selling or spinning off the consumer division, which represents less than 5 percent of sales, should be considered, too. Likewise, Cisco may want to shut down new operations, like servers. The overall goal should be to refocus management on its hugely profitable markets in switches and routers. There’s also Cisco’s $44 billion cash pile. Much of this is offshore and subject to taxation upon repatriation. But even that might be preferable to wasting it on deals. The upside could be considerable. Cisco shares now trade at 10 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. That’s almost a 20 percent discount to I.B.M. Adjust for Cisco’s cash and the gap is twice as big. If Cisco can fix its problems, this discount should disappear and the stock could be worth some $25. Of course, all these moves require Mr. Chambers to repudiate much of the strategy of the last decade. That would also implicate his board, which is populated by Silicon Valley heavyweights, including the chief executive and founder of Yahoo and the former chiefs of Vodafone, Compaq and Wells Fargo. Given this, Cisco shareholders, not to mention its employees who are highly incentivized with the shares, would probably only rally around an outsider with a track record of winning board seats and inspiring companies to do better. Luckily for would-be cage-rattlers, Cisco has no single giant shareholder. That’s an impediment to urging, say, Microsoft — whose shares have underperformed Cisco’s — into action. Even after 16 years at the helm and some hefty options grants, Mr. Chambers has less than half of 1 percent of the company. The good news for shareholders is that he seems to be getting the message. But it may be too late to avoid a fight.

The company had announced last year that it would start paying a dividend equating to an annual yield of 1 to 2 percent, but had not specified the amount or precise timing. The dividend amounts to an annual yield of 1.4 percent at Thursday’s closing price of $17. The shares hit a 52-week low of $16.97 on Thursday.

But several of them have started paying small dividends as they find their business maturing. Microsoft introduced a dividend in 2003 and now carries a 2.6 percent annual yield. Hewlett-Packard, which competes with Cisco in many fields, has a yield of 0.8 percent. Among the companies that do not pay a dividend are Apple, Dell and eBay. Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said its “leadership position in the markets we serve is strong,” making this the time to reward shareholders.

The dividend will cost $1.3 billion a year. Cisco had $40.2 billion in cash in February, but only $3.1 billion is in the United States. The rest sits at overseas subsidiaries. Cisco has been reluctant to repatriate that money, because it will then be taxed at the 35 percent American corporate tax rate. It is lobbying Washington for a tax amnesty on overseas earnings, and the chief executive, John T.

His statement that spending by government agencies on technology equipment remained depressed because of the economy and that it probably would get worse in the near future helped send company shares down about 9 percent in after-hours trading to $20.07. In regular trading, Cisco shares closed up 5 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $22.04. He spooked Wall Street three months ago with a cautious outlook with its first quarter earnings report. He noted “air pockets” coinciding with big declines in orders by government agencies and cable operators. He delivered much of the same message Wednesday. Cisco, which sells telecommunications equipment and routers for directing Internet traffic, is largely alone in its struggles among large technology companies that recently reported results, including Google and Intel. Normally, Wall Street analysts and investors follow Cisco’s results closely because the company is considered a bellwether for corporate technology spending. But in this case, it is an anomaly with lagging performance while other companies flourish. Mr. Chambers, who is usually upbeat about Cisco’s future, explained that it was in transition, in part because of a raft of new products in its switching business. But he bragged about the results in other areas like new businesses, including data centers, collaboration and wireless, which together grew 15 percent. But he said that because of declines in sales of consumer product and switches, Cisco expected only 4 to 6 percent revenue growth in the current quarter. He predicted that growth would improve to 8 to 11 percent in Cisco’s fourth quarter. He said that, although the economy was picking up, there would be a delay before corporate customers started buying again. He said optimism was starting to increase and that sales should start to reflect that. For the full fiscal year, Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said its revenue growth would be in the low end of its previous forecast of 9 to 11 percent. “I think we will look back on this period of time and wish we could have avoided it,” he said in a conference call with analysts. Sales to the public sector grew 7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, although he said he expected slower growth soon. Consumer product sales fell 15 percent while revenue from switches fell 8 percent.

John Chambers, right, demonstrates a connected television system by Cisco. John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, presented Videoscape, a hardware and software system for next-generation video viewing, at a news conference at the Consumer Electronics Show here in Las Vegas on Wednesday, but he did not disclose any partners for the technology in the United States. “I think there’s going to be an opportunity to completely redefine the TV experience,” Mr. Chambers said, essentially throwing Cisco’s hat into the ring in the battle for control of the digital living room. But the news was underwhelming because there was little in the way of concrete product information. Cisco said it would not be demonstrating Videoscape on the show floor, but would demo it privately. The company did demonstrate on stage though.  Videoscape involves an improved set-top box, an on-screen guide that blends TV and Internet video sources, and an ability to effortlessly transition video from television screen to tablet to mobile screen to laptop. It is still a long way from a living room near you, which Mr. Chambers tacitly acknowledged when he said there will be just a “handful” of service providers “that will move very aggressively across the board.” He said Cisco would also make it possible for service providers — think Time Warner Cable, Verizon, DirecTV, etc. in the United States — to implement the Videoscape model piece by piece. (Whether they want to, however, is an open question.) “You’ll see us, just about every quarter, announce tighter relationships with key service providers,” Mr. Chambers predicted as he announced a partnership with Telstra, a communications company in Australia. Cisco emphasized that it wants to work together with service providers, as opposed to building a standalone hardware solution. After all, the vast majority of the viewing public already has a piece of hardware, a set-top box, that sits near the TV set. Cisco wants more of its hardware around that set. Along with a Videoscape set-top box that supported both linear TV and Internet video, it placed a media gateway device, which integrated data, voice, and video, and a telepresence set-up in its on-stage living room on Wednesday. Cisco’s imagined on-screen guide had three columns. The largest was a slicker version of what we all see on TV now, the live and on-demand options from the service provider. The second column was Web content from partners, and the third was content from “my network.” Mr. Chambers showed a Flip video from a family member in that column. Mr. Chambers proposed that all of these interactions between devices and networks would require Cisco architecture through and through.

John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, said the company saw a big drop in spending by government agencies and cable television operators in its first quarter, which ended Oct. 30. He said he expected revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent in the current quarter and 9 percent to 12 percent for Cisco’s 2011 fiscal year. That was less than the 13 percent that analysts had expected. “We have a couple of pockets that we have to fly through,” Mr. Chambers said. Orders from state governments fell 25 percent compared with a year ago and were 48 percent lower than the previous quarter. Orders from cable operators fell 35 percent from a year ago. Cisco’s financial performance is considered an important bellwether of corporate technology spending because the company has a broad base of customers. Cisco’s main business is making equipment for telecommunications networks and for routing Internet traffic, though in recent years it has pushed into consumer electronics. A number of technology companies reporting earnings in recent weeks, like Microsoft, Google and Intel, have not shown weakness. Unlike Cisco, however, those other companies did not report results from October. “The big question is whether this is Cisco specific or whether there is something about the market that we should be more concerned about,” said Bill Choi, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Company. “It starts to raise questions about the recent tech stock run up.” Cisco’s shares fell $3.09 to $21.40 in after-hours trading, after its earnings announcement. The company’s shares closed up 14 cents, to $24.49, in regular trading on Wednesday. Cisco’s first-quarter earnings rose 8 percent to $1.9 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $1.8 billion, or 30 cents a share, a year ago. The company said revenue climbed 19 percent, to $10.75 billion. Sales of routers during the first quarter increased 13 percent, while sales of switches grew 25 percent. Cisco’s newer product lines like servers and collaboration products, which account for only a small part of its business, also grew rapidly. Last quarter, Mr. Chambers jolted investors when he said that orders had dipped in late June and early July because of economic uncertainty. He then followed up by issuing an unusually cautious outlook for the first quarter.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/u-s-companies-hoarding-almost-1-trillion-cash/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">U.S. Companies Hoarding Almost $1 Trillion in Cash<date>October 27, 2010, 5:57 am</date><text>American companies are hoarding almost $1 trillion in cash, but are unlikely to spend on expanding their businesses and hiring new employees because of continuing uncertainty about the strength of the economy, Moody’s Investors Service says. As the economy stabilizes, companies are also more likely to spend on share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions, Moody’s said on Tuesday. Nonfinancial companies are sitting on $943 billion of cash and short-term investments, as of the middle of the year, compared with $775 billion at the end of 2008, Reuters said, citing Moody’s. This would be enough to cover a year’s worth of capital spending and dividends and still have $121 billion left over, it said. Only 20 companies hold a large portion of corporate cash balances, with $346 billion on their balance sheets, or 37 percent of the total, Moody’s said. Cisco Systems has the largest cash balance, at $39.86 billion, while Microsoft is second with $36.79 billion, Moody’s said. Google has the third-largest balance with $30.06 billion, followed by Oracle with $23.64 billion and Ford Motor at $21.89 billion.

And now there's superhigh-quality chat over your TV from Cisco for $898.88, for a year of service. On Wednesday, Cisco unveiled its long-awaited Umi (you-me) videoconferencing system aimed at consumers. The Umi rig includes a camera that fits on the top of a high-definition TV and a rectangular appliance that connects to the TV and Internet, while also handling the processing of the video data. The hardware costs $599, while Cisco's calling service will cost $24.99 a month. People can preorder the systems from Cisco now. They'll go on sale from Cisco and Best Buy in mid-November, only in the United States. Verizon plans to offer the Umi devices and services to its FiOS customers in early 2011 as well. I tried out the Umi technology this morning, and it worked well. When two Umi homes hold a call together, they'll see a high-quality image in which people come through far clearer than on most comparable Web services. The picture is big and crisp, and the overall experience is much improved over Web chat. When a call comes in, the Umi system will interrupt whatever is playing on the television and present a menu that lets you answer or skip the call. Because of Cisco's set-up, you tend to look right into the eye of the people you're talking to rather than at a Web cam, as people often do with Skype and similar services. That eye contact really makes the conversations feel fluid and familiar. The Cisco service also provides the equivalent of a video answering machine. People can leave messages for callers and receive video messages from people when they've missed a call. You can watch those on the TV or on a Web portal. While the service works best between two Umis because of all the video compression and decompression work done by the appliance, you can make a call from Google video chat on a PC to an Umi. There are some obvious limitations to the Umi technology. For one, people have to create their own contact lists or borrow from their Google contacts. That's a problem if you have lots of contacts on Skype, AIM or some other service. In addition, you need a cable-quality high-speed Internet connection, so some DSL customers will be left out. Then, there's the price. You get the higher quality and all the additional services, but the Umi competes against things that are free or much cheaper. Microsoft, for example, will offer some impressive video conferencing tools with its coming Kinect camera and sensor add-on to the Xbox 360. That hardware bundle will cost about $399, while a subscription to Xbox Live costs $60 a year and includes a lot of other features beyond video conferencing. ''I don't look at the price as being outrageous,'' said Gina Clark, a vice president at Cisco. ''There are lots of products that are free or good enough,'' she added. ''If a consumer is happy with those, there is no reason to switch. Our research shows a lot of consumers have tried those products and felt that experience wanting.'' Cisco will spare no expense in promoting the Umi systems. Oprah Winfrey will soon begin calling remote guests via Umis, and Cisco has a fresh television ad campaign set to run for the devices. Cisco is one of the biggest backers of video conferencing and has sold high-end systems to businesses for a number of years. And having lots of video data filling up networks helps Cisco's main business of selling switches and routers to communications companies and service providers. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Mr. Bates was also in charge of Cisco’s voice technology group, an important post in Cisco’s strategy to become more of a consumer products company. Joshua Silverman, a former eBay executive who has run Skype since early 2008, will step aside to make room for Mr. Bates, who is expected to join the company at the end of October. In 2005, eBay paid $2.6 billion for the start-up phone service but never integrated the company into its online auction business. An official Cisco blog on Monday said that Mr. Bates was departing “to pursue another opportunity” and announced that Padmasree Warrior, Cisco’s chief technical officer, would succeed him. Last November, Silver Lake Partners, a private equity company focused on technology, led a group that acquired a majority stake in Luxembourg-based Skype, valuing the company at $2.75 billion. Minority owners include eBay, which retained 30 percent of the company; Skype’s founders, who were awarded a 14 percent stake as part of a litigation settlement with the company; and the Internet entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, who owns a small fraction of the business through his venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Mr. Bates will assume leadership of Skype as it looks to tap the public markets. Skype filed for an initial public offering in August, but it was unclear when the company would be able to complete the stock sale. The volume of postponed I.P.O.’s worldwide has reached a record $69.7 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters. Even if Skype does not go public soon, Mr. Bates must determine how to squeeze more profit from its 560 million registered users. Of the 124 million customers who use Skype each month, only 8.1 million pay, according to its securities filing. Skype allows registered users to make free calls to one another and makes money by charging a few cents per minute for calls to people who do not use the service. Skype is profitable, earning $13 million on revenue of $406 million through the first six months of this year. Last week Skype announced an agreement with a telecommunications company, Avaya, also owned by Silver Lake, that is expected to bring Skype’s services deeper into the corporate arena, a major growth initiative for the company. Skype is also in talks with Facebook about a partnership, say people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Bates’s departure is a blow to Cisco, where he was considered a rising star. He reported directly to John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive. He is at least the second Cisco executive Skype has lured away in the last 12 months. In November, Jonathan Rosenberg, then a Cisco Fellow in Mr. Bates’s voice technology group, left to become Skype’s chief technology executive. Cisco is expected to unveil a new line of lower-cost videoconferencing systems this week. The company has long hinted that it would sell the miniaturized versions of its corporate videoconferencing systems directly to consumers. The devices have the potential of competing against Skype’s service. Private equity firms typically replace the incumbent executive team after acquiring a company. Skype’s new owners have already installed a new chief financial officer, general counsel and marketing head. Born and raised in England, Mr. Bates, 43, has served on a number of boards of technology companies, including YouTube before its acquisition by Google in 2006.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/cisco-to-buy-arch-rock-a-smart-grid-firm/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco to Buy Arch Rock, a Smart Grid Firm<date>September 3, 2010, 5:45 am</date><text>Network equipment maker Cisco Systems said on Thursday it was buying start-up Arch Rock for an undisclosed sum as it aggressively moves to expand in the growing smart grid market, Reuters reported.

The reality is that setting up a home network to make all that happen is still a more daunting task than most home improvement projects. And it may be even harder getting one to work reliably when every family member is on his or her own computer or smartphone, simultaneously streaming, posting and surfing. “The wireless category has never made itself inviting to the consumer,” said Simon Fleming-Wood, a senior director for marketing at Cisco, which owns the Linksys brand of home networking equipment. “When you shop for networking products, you feel like you’re in the plumbing aisle of a home improvement store.” While the idea of accessing content while roaming untethered from room to room is appealing, there is only so much bandwidth in the house available to handle all that traffic simultaneously. Popping popcorn in the kitchen microwave for the Netflix movie you were expecting to stream from your Wii can disable the network. Or your spouse’s desire to watch YouTube videos of babies on in-line skates could slow down your ability to download that spreadsheet your boss is waiting for you to revise from home. Everyone loves the idea of wireless — and that’s the problem. Most wireless traffic travels on the 2.4 gigahertz band, including cordless phones. A microwave oven operates at the same frequency. Put a wireless router too close to either and you can easily knock the router off line or slow the response rate to a crawl. Your neighbor’s network can do the same thing. “The 2.4 gigahertz band is unlicensed, so all the neighbors using that frequency interfere with your bandwidth, and it’s happening more and more,” said Chris Geiser, a product line manager for Netgear, a maker of networking products. The newest routers use the 802.11N standard, which allows a wireless signal to travel farther than the older 802.11G standard, which is good for getting the signal to your upstairs bedroom — but it can also send it to your neighbor’s upstairs bedroom. Some of the new N-standard routers also use a second, higher 5 gigahertz frequency, which does not get interference from kitchen appliances. The problem is that not all devices seeking the wireless signal can receive that higher frequency. For example, Sony’s PlayStation 3 and some PCs operate only on that congested 2.4 gigahertz band. Where you put your router can drastically alter the distance the signal can travel. According to Mr. Fleming-Wood, a wireless router’s signal strength can be cut short when it hits walls at an oblique angle or tries to travel through a kitchen’s ceramic tile or a bedroom full of mirrors. You can extend the signal range of a wireless router with a device called a wireless bridge or range extender. (You can also use Wi-Fire, an external antenna from hField Technologies that increases the signal strength.) But if the signal emanating from the router is not strong enough to get to the bridge, the connection may not prove reliable. “Just moving a router to the top of a desk can make all the difference,” said Joe Melfi, associate director of technical marketing at D-Link, which makes both wireless and wired Internet hardware. A direct, wired connection to your PC, Internet-capable TV or game console usually works better than a wireless network. According to Mr. Geiser of Netgear, the company receives 70 percent fewer support calls for its wired products than its wireless ones. Setting up a wired connection to most places in your home is easier than you think. While most of us don’t have Ethernet cables — those thick wires that come in blue or yellow and have fat phonelike connectors at the ends — in the walls of our homes, there is an easy solution: you use a special module to send the Internet signal from your router along your home’s existing electrical or cable wiring. The signal pops out through a receiving module you place near the PC or TV that you want to connect to the Internet. “If I had total choice, a wired solution is definitely a better choice,” Mr. Melfi said. Neither solution is right for every home. The electrical wiring products, known as HomePlug or powerline (the newest, fastest version available is HomePlug AV), may not be able to carry multiple streams of HDTV. And the cable solution, called MoCA, may not work if you use your coaxial cables to receive satellite TV. Not only are wired solutions impervious to interference from other appliances or your neighbors’ networks, they are also more secure. “MoCA is like a walled garden,’” said Rob Gelphman, an executive with the MoCA Alliance, a trade group. Most people also love the idea of streaming video — and that is the other major problem. Video requires an Internet connection that streams more bits per second to deliver a high-quality image to your TV. While a basic DSL or cable Internet connection speed may be just fine for reaching the Web and downloading music, you will probably need to bump up the speed — and pay more to your Internet service provider — if you want to watch streaming movies. Netflix, one of the most convenient services for streaming movies, says that it adjusts its picture quality depending on each user’s connection speed. It specifically suggests a minimum of 5 megabits per second if you want to watch its streaming movies in high definition. To watch films while doing other things online, you will need even more speed. To minimize problems if you are trying to stream video wirelessly, look for a router that offers “Quality of Service” streaming. With these latest products, the router gives a higher priority to more-demanding video traffic than Internet data downloads. For example, Netgear’s WNDR3700 router (about $150) gives the highest priority to voice-over-Internet protocol applications (phone calls made using services like Skype or Vonage), then video, Web sites, file transfers and bit torrents, in that order. Some products automatically detect and assign priorities to streamed content, while others may require the user to manually set those parameters. Most companies are trying to make this more comprehensible. Cisco offers its Valet line of routers, which aim to make wireless connections plug and play, free from configuration jargon. Netgear routers use a setup program accessible from a Web site. Setting up a home network may be moving toward a plug and play future, but to get there you most likely will need to follow another strategy: buy and return. Sadly, router makers seem to think that is normal. According to Mr. Melfi of D-Link, picking the right product is still a trial-and-error process. “It’s like going to the doctor: there are five treatments for one problem. You need to pick the best.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/12cisco.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Profit Climbs at Cisco, but Sales Forecast Falls Below Expectations<date>Published: August 11, 2010</date><text>Cisco Systems, the computer networking equipment maker, reported stronger quarterly earnings on Wednesday as its customers continued to catch up on delayed purchases, but its chief executive said the company was seeing signs of the economic recovery slowing down. Shares in the company fell in after-hours trading Wednesday as revenue missed Wall Street expectations. The Cisco chief executive, John T. Chambers, also offered a sales forecast for the new quarter that came in below expectations. Cisco’s sales are heavily dependent on capital spending at large corporations, phone companies and government agencies across the world, and an uncertain economy means those customers may spend less. “We’re seeing a large number of mixed signals,” Mr. Chambers said. “We think the words ‘unusual uncertainty’ are an accurate description of what’s occurring.” Cisco said both net income and revenue bounced back from last year’s recessionary levels. Still, analysts were expecting even stronger results after a couple of quarters of Cisco exceeding its own expectations. The company earned $1.9 billion, or 33 cents a share, in its fourth quarter, which ended July 31. That was up 79 percent from $1.1 billion, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 27 percent, to $10.8 billion, just under analysts’ forecasts of $10.9 billion. Cisco had projected revenue of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. Revenue in the quarter a year earlier was $8.5 billion. In extended trading after the release of the results, Cisco shares fell as much as $1.89, to $21.84. That came on top of regular-session losses of 58 cents to close at $23.73. Excluding one-time charges and the cost of stock-based compensation, the company, based in San Jose, Calif., earned 43 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 42 cents, on average. Mr. Chambers said he expected revenue in the current quarter to rise 18 to 20 percent from the same period a year earlier, which works out to $10.65 billion to $10.83 billion. Analysts were expecting $10.95 billion, on average.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/motorolas-path-to-breakup/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Motorola's Path to Breakup<date>July 20, 2010, 3:34 am</date><text>Motorola is getting closer to splitting itself up, with the announcement of a deal to sell its Networks division to Nokia Siemens Networks. Next year, the remainder of Motorola is splitting into two companies. Motorola is currently made up of four units: Enterprise Mobility, Mobile Devices, Home and Networks. The Associated Press provides a summary of each and says something of what their fate will be come the split. Enterprise Mobility — Makes police radios, bar-code scanners and other equipment for government and corporate clients. It had $1.69 billion in revenue in the first quarter and operating earnings of $141 million. This unit will be called Motorola Solutions when it becomes a separate company early next year. Mobile Devices — The cellphone unit will be called Motorola Mobility when it becomes a separate company early next year, together with the Home unit. Had $1.64 billion in revenue in the first quarter and lost $192 million on an operating basis. Home — This unit makes cable TV set-top boxes and modems. It’s a leading provider in the United States, competing with Cisco Systems. It will be combined with Mobile Devices to form Motorola Mobility early next year. It had $838 million in revenue in the first quarter and $20 million in earnings. Networks — Most of this unit is being sold to Nokia Siemens networks for $1.2 billion. It makes network equipment for wireless carriers, notably Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless, but has fallen behind the times. It had sales of $896 million in the first quarter and earnings of $112 million.

Cisco Systems intends to hawk tablet computers in the more sedate world of the office. On Tuesday, Cisco revealed its plans to begin selling a tablet computer named Cius -- like ''see us'' -- early next year. Cisco pigeonholed the product as a ''collaboration tool'' for businesspeople, saying it's well suited to conducting video conferences and running business software like Cisco's very own WebEx application. The typical collection of Cisco equipment resellers and partners will sell, um, Ciuses. ''We haven't thought about a big consumer play at all here,'' said Barry O'Sullivan, the senior vice president in Cisco's voice technology group. ''This is a mobile video device for corporate users.'' Not exactly the ''iPad is magical'' pitch, is it? The Cius has a 7-inch screen and runs Google's Android software. Cisco is talking about the product now in the hope that developers will begin creating some business software for the product, Mr. O'Sullivan said. The device also has a 720p high-definition webcam on the front and a 5-megapixel camera on the back for still images and streaming video. Mr. O'Sullivan said some workers might opt to have a Cius as their lone office computer. It runs on Intel's Atom chip, typically found in laptops, and can connect to a monitor and keyboard. The device will ship with some virtualization software as well that lets it run software that is sent out from a data center. The Cius may have an edge over more consumer-oriented products because Cisco will ship it with a variety of security and management controls aimed at pleasing I.T. departments. Mr. O'Sullivan acknowledged that consumers exerted more influence these days over what technology was picked at companies, but added that companies wanted controls over the technology. ''We think a lot about the consumerization of I.T.,'' he said. ''The people we work with in I.T. are caught in the middle of that trend.'' The Cisco brand has popped up in more public places of late. The company sells Internet phones that that sit on workers' desks and has Flip video recorders for consumers. The Cius would fit in with this trend of Cisco branching out of the data center. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Two years into his presidency, the 44-year-old, tech-savvy Kremlin chief still lives in the shadow of his predecessor Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, but that hasn’t stopped him from strenuously pursuing pet projects, the most grandiose of which is the creation of Russia’s own Silicon Valley outside Moscow. But to succeed, Mr. Medvedev knows he needs to attract some of the best minds and investors in the United States to a project that many Russian businessmen are already skeptical about. In four months, the Kremlin has lavished an ”innograd” — or innovation city — project with budget allocations of hundreds of millions of dollars, attracted entrepreneurs and scientists, and last week in St. Petersburg secured a promise from Silicon Valley’s own Cisco Systems to participate in the ambitious venture. However, despite numerous tax breaks — companies are expected to enjoy an unprecedented 10-year grace period — potential investors are likely to share the same concerns as many Russian businessmen: that the project will be nothing more than a huge real estate project.

The country’s plan to stop naked shorting of some financial stocks and European government bonds as well as related credit-default swaps, starting Wednesday, may score political points. But it sows confusion, and will hardly help tackle the causes of Europe’s financial woes.The German ban appears to apply to shares of the country’s 10 largest financial institutions, European government bonds and European sovereign default swaps. The first is fairly harmless, the second seemingly pointless and the third downright confusing. It is not uncommon for regulators to ban naked shorting of stocks. American investors, for example, have long been prevented from selling shares short unless they have agreed to borrow an equivalent amount of stock. In this respect, the German plan is not such a big deal. The only question is why it does not apply to the entire stock market. The decision to focus on European government bonds is more surprising. Euro zone politicians have taken to blaming speculators betting on sovereign defaults for the financial crisis. But short-selling of government bonds isn’t widespread. Even trading in more liquid sovereign credit-default swaps — where investors buy protection against a euro zone country defaulting on its debt — hardly suggests a speculative frenzy. In the week ending May 7, net outstanding default swaps on Greek debt totaled $7.7 billion, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. A year earlier, the figure was $7.8 billion. The naked credit-default swap ban is also hard to enforce, even in the markets under Germany’s control. Regulators will somehow have to distinguish between investors who are hedging from those speculating. It is also hard to see what Germany can do by acting alone. Unless other European countries follow its lead, there will be little to stop investors from shorting euro zone sovereign debt elsewhere. News of the ban caused confusion in financial markets on Tuesday. It seems unlikely to achieve much else. Overseas Cash Piles It has become a rite of passage for young and ambitious computer wizards to pack their bags for California. But giants like Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Google have tens of billions of dollars trapped outside the United States. Perhaps the young techies should consider basing or at least incorporating their new technology businesses overseas if they want the best chance of selling out to an industry leader. Google’s purchase of Global IP Solutions, which is based in San Francisco and listed in Oslo, announced on Tuesday, is just the latest example. And the technology aristocracy has plenty of overseas firepower. Cisco, Microsoft and Apple, for example, had $120 billion of cash and investments on their balance sheets at the end of last quarter, and very little debt. While many companies don’t break out the figures, much of this is stuck overseas. EBay, for example, had 75 percent of its hoard in foreign countries at the end of 2009. If the companies were to bring the money home to the United States, they would have to pay the United States tax rate on repatriated profits, rather than the typically lower taxes elsewhere. These overseas piles are growing, too. Technology spending is increasing at a fast clip in places like China and Russia. The tech companies’ costs, however, are still weighted toward the United States. So what are the tech giants to do? They can lobby for another tax amnesty, the last one of which came in 2004. Another solution is to use the trapped cash to buy overseas rivals. Cisco, for example, acquired Tandberg, based in Norway, earlier this year for $3.4 billion. Sure, Google wanted Global IP Solutions primarily for its voice technology, not the small tax benefit of using its overseas cash. And the tech industry has traditionally clustered in California because there’s lots of engineering talent, venture capital and specialized services that add value for businesses based there. Yet at the margin, there may be an edge for an entrepreneur looking to sell out if the big boys can use their overseas cash. Silicon Valley has long counted on talented Asian and European immigrants for much of its innovation and growth. The tech giants’ trapped cash piles might be something that encourages them to maintain their ties with their home countries.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/technology/13cisco.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco Sales Rise, Beating Estimates<date>Published: May 12, 2010</date><text>Cisco Systems, the maker of networking equipment, on Wednesday reported third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates. The results were helped by orders from corporate customers that had surging video and Internet traffic. Net income rose 63 percent, to $2.19 billion, or 37 cents a share, from $1.35 billion, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Excluding costs like stock compensation, profit was 42 cents a share. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had estimated 39 cents a share. Cisco shares have climbed 43 percent in the last year as investors bet that corporate spending would accelerate again after the recession. Cisco’s stock dropped 59 cents, to $26.15, in late trading after the report. The shares had risen 78 cents, or 3 percent, to close at $26.74 in anticipation of the earnings report. Sales climbed 27 percent, to $10.4 billion, in the period ended May 1. Analysts had predicted $10.2 billion. Revenue this quarter will increase 25 to 28 percent from a year earlier, Cisco said in a conference call. That equates to a level of at least $10.7 billion. Analysts had estimated sales of $10.6 billion.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E0D71F31F934A35756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=ciscosystemsinc">Saudi Gets Prison for Selling Phony Goods to the Military<date>Published: May 7, 2010</date><text>HOUSTON -- A Saudi man was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison for selling counterfeit computer parts to the Marine Corps for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The sentencing of the Saudi, Ehab Ashoor, 48, who lived in Sugar Land, Tex., was part of a broader federal crackdown on shady businesses that supply shoddy computer goods to the military and federal agencies. Next month, two Houston brothers, Michael and Richard Edman, are scheduled to be sentenced after pleading guilty to selling computer network cards to the Marine Corps, Air Force, F.B.I., Federal Aviation Administration and Energy Department, among other agencies. Judge David Hittner of United States District Court sentenced Mr. Ashoor on Thursday to 51 months in prison, the maximum term recommended by federal prosecutors. Mr. Ashoor sat slumped in his chair as the judge read the sentence. When the prosecutor pointed out that Mr. Ashoor had shown disregard for the men and women serving in Iraq, the judge quipped, ''Well, they're obviously not his men and women.'' ''See that he is deported,'' Judge Hittner said, raising his voice in anger, after handing down the sentence. Erich Ferrari, Mr. Ashoor's lawyer, said he would appeal the sentence.Mr. Ashoor pleaded guilty to buying 200 counterfeit networking cards in Hong Kong that were inferior copies of the Cisco Systems cards he was under contract to provide to the Marine Corps. The cards are used in helicopters, airplanes and computer equipment to transmit data about troop movements and other sensitive information. ''This guy was getting rich and didn't care about what goes into our airplanes and helicopters in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' said John Morton, assistant secretary of homeland security. Mr. Ashoor's company, CDS Federal, bought the cards on eBay for $25 each in July 2008 and charged the Marine Corps $625 each, the indictment said. He also repackaged the cards to make them appear to be Cisco products. Mr. Ashoor's wife, Nargus Khan, 40, said they had lived in the United States for 20 years and had two children, but had remained citizens of Saudi Arabia. She said the family now faced financial hardship; Mr. Ashoor was forced to pay Cisco $119,000 in restitution. Mr. Morton said the shoddy computer parts were never used. Customs agents noticed something amiss with the shipment and referred it to investigators, so the Marine Corps stockpiled the parts until the inquiry was finished, he said. The Edman brothers were involved in a similar scam through their compay, Syren Technology, Mr. Morton said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/michael-capellas-to-lead-acadia-joint-venture/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Michael Capellas to Lead Acadia Joint Venture<date>May 6, 2010, 4:40 am</date><text>From Sumner Lemon at IDG News Service: EMC and Cisco have tapped former Compaq Computer chief executive, Michael Capellas, to head their Acadia services joint venture, the companies said Thursday.

About 80 percent of the increase has been demand for audio conferencing, and 20 percent for video conferencing services, said Mr. McCormack, who is based in Boston. He added that most of BT’s large corporate clients, like PepsiCo and Philips Electronics, had increased their use of video conferencing to cope with the travel disruptions. “We have seen the largest demand in audio conferencing because when people are in an ad hoc fashion having to react to the situation, this is what they do first,” Mr. McCormack said. “But we are also seeing an increase in video conferencing.” To meet demand, Deutsche Telekom said it was offering its largest corporate customers the ability to use the operator’s own internal conferencing studios and equipment, made by Cisco Systems, at eight German locations. The operator said it planned to extend the offer to other big customers temporarily on an emergency basis. Skype, the Internet-based telecommunications operator, said the company had also seen an increase in video conferencing over its service since the volcano’s eruption. “Skype has seen increased volumes in voice and video calling over the last week,” said Kim Milosevich, a Skype spokeswoman in London. She said the company was unable to release more specific figures on the increase but had many anecdotal accounts of its use. In one case, a couple stranded in Dubai decided to televise their wedding vows over a Skype video conference to guests gathered for their wedding ceremony on Saturday in England, Ms. Milosevich said. Andew W. Davis, a senior partner at Wainhouse Research, a company that tracks the video conferencing industry, said the disruption had prompted him to revise his growth forecast for industry sales of conferencing equipment this year to 15 percent from 10 percent. Mr. Davis said global sales of video conferencing equipment and software reached $1.5 billion in 2009. “We have seen from every major disruption like this an increase in the use of video conferencing,” said Mr. Davis, who is based in Duxbury, Massachusetts. “I am 99 percent sure that we will see another increase this time also.” Keith Gyford, the managing director of First Connections, a video conferencing operator based in Basingstoke, England, said he also expected the unprecedented travel disruptions to lift interest in the company’s telecommunications business. “These types of events only raise the profile of the technology,” Mr. Gyford said. Ruth Rowan, the marketing director in Britain for BT who normally works from London, has been stranded since last week at BT’s regional center in Boston, where she had been attending a research conference. “We have had many of the international guests at the conference who have been stranded in Boston like me coming into our offices to use our conferencing services,” Ms. Rowan said. The director of a local government council in Britain was planning to hold her regular two-hour council meeting by BT conference from Boston, she added. “People are definitely using conferencing to cope with the situation,” Ms. Rowan said. Cisco Systems will standardize its videoconferencing systems to be compatible with products offered by other companies, a top executive said Monday, Bloomberg News reported from Helsinki. Cisco, the world’s largest maker of network equipment, recently acquired Tandberg of Norway for 19 billion kroner, or $3.2 billion, in an effort to capture more of a growing market. Some single-screen products from the two companies already talk to each other.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/business/11haggler.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">At Cisco and Wells Fargo, Communication Breakdowns<date>Published: April 10, 2010</date><text>LET’S start with an update about the Flip video camera. The Haggler wrote recently about a manufacturing flaw with the device’s USB arm, the doodad that links it to your computer. At the time, Flip representatives offered assurances that the problem had been fixed, so a few weeks ago, the Haggler bought one — a sleek, silvery contraption that came in a nifty black box.Unfortunately, it had a faulty USB arm and would not link to the Haggler’s iMac. So the Haggler returned it for a replacement, which also had a faulty USB arm. That one also expired — no vital signs but for a recording light — the first time it was used. So the Haggler sent it to the manufacturer, Cisco Systems. A few days later this e-mail message arrived, copied here verbatim: “Flip Video has removed the model numberDVD-DATA-RECOVERYfrom RMA number 700806.” Would you care to guess, dear reader, at the meaning of these words? Good luck. A service rep subsequently explained the mystery: This was Cisco’s way of saying that whatever videos were on the Flip could not be recovered to a DVD and returned to you. Well, duh. It seems a bit odd to send the gibberish e-mail first and the translation later, and only if you express bewilderment. Here’s an idea that may sound insane but humor the Haggler for a moment: Perhaps Cisco could offer the translation first and then the gibberish to anyone who found it too straightforward. Karen Sohn, a Cisco P.R. rep said via e-mail that the company was revising this correspondence with customers and would send the new language as soon as it had been drafted. The Haggler was going to offer a simple alternative: “Hey Flip customer. In case you were hoping we’d retrieve the videos on your camera — we can’t. Sorry. Bye.” Then Ms. Sohn called to say that the company was unable to change the wording because — well, it just can’t, O.K.? Yes, Cisco is a tech company, but apparently it is powerless to alter the software that generates the language of this particular e-mail. “So we decided to stop sending it,” Ms. Sohn said. Yahtzee! Problem solved. Next. Q. A few months ago, I borrowed about $5,000 through my Wells Fargo line of credit and promptly paid it back, plus interest, in a couple of weeks. I know from past experience that when you pay off loans like this, you need to check whether there is any residual interest that posts at the end of a 30-day account cycle. The reason is that interest accrues in real time, and given the slight lag between when you transfer the money and when it actually lands in your account, there is often a difference between what you paid and how much you actually owe. So the vigilant consumer that I am, I looked at my account for several weeks, just to be sure I had paid off the whole loan. Each time, the balance in my line of credit account was zero. A couple months later, a Wells Fargo collections agent called and spoke to me as if I were a felon. Seems I actually had owed about $30 in that line of credit account, and now that it was overdue by three months, I also owed $117 ($39 a month) in late fees. Here’s the galling part: The $30 in interest that caused those late fees never showed up in my line-of-credit account when I checked online. Ever. The rep said I was looking in the wrong place. If I’d opened a PDF file linked to my account page, she explained, I would have seen the actual sum that I owed. But why would I open any file, or check anywhere else on the site, when my home page at Wells Fargo plainly tells me that I owe nothing? Here’s a variation on the same question: Why put the accurate number in a PDF file and an inaccurate number where customers routinely look? Would it be too cynical to suggest that this is about generating fees? Heather Gramp Portland, Ore. A. We put this question to Lisa Westermann, a Wells Fargo P.R. rep. She explained that the home page of online accounts will list principal owed but not interest and fees. Why? Because the interest and fees change, often day to day. To which the Haggler replied, "And that’s a problem because?" Seriously, if you can keep that ever-changing information up to date in a PDF file, why not on the customer’s account page? And if you really lack the technology to keep the account page accurate, why not just tell customers: “Hey, you owe fees and interest. Call us.” That would be more helpful than posting “$0.” Ms. Westermann and the Haggler went around and around on this one for a few minutes on the phone. She said it suffices that there is a sentence on the Web site instructing customers to click that PDF file for a more complete view of their accounts. The Haggler: “Why not just alert customers that they are on the hook for fees and interest?” Ms. Westermann: “Because those change.” And around and around we went again. This was threatening to become one of those circular conversations that ends with you making the face from that guy in “The Scream.” Until Ms. Westermann said that Wells Fargo “will be fixing this; it’s just a matter of figuring out the best way to fix it.” Ah, Wells Fargo isn’t trying to snooker its customers! It just needs some advice on a fix. So how about this? Instead of an account page that says “$0” when fees and interest are owed, how about if it said “NOT $0” when fees and interest are owed? Double Yahtzee! That’s comped, Wells Fargo. The next brilliant idea is going to cost you.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/technology/personaltech/08pogue.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Hot Spot Shortcut, in the Weeds<date>Published: April 7, 2010</date><text>You want to hear a really scary statistic? Twenty-five percent.That’s how many wireless routers get returned to the store. Not because there’s anything wrong with them, but because they’re too complicated to set up. Come to think of it, that means there is something wrong with those routers. A wireless router is a plastic box that, when plugged into the D.S.L. or cable modem that delivers your Internet service, creates a Wi-Fi hot spot in your home. With it, all your laptops, iPod Touches, set-top boxes, game consoles and other gadgets can get online. To Cisco Systems, that “25 percent” statistic is especially scary, because the home Wi-Fi router market is enormous. In this country, 65 percent of homes have high-speed Internet service, but only half of those have gone wireless. So about a year ago, Cisco, maker of Linksys routers, made a huge and expensive gamble in hopes of becoming, in its own words, “the Apple of the networking industry.” It paid $590 million to buy Pure Digital, the company that makes Flip camcorders. Why? Because Flip camcorders are drop-dead simple to use — push one big red button, and you’ve mastered it. No wonder the idiot-proof, stripped-down, no-zoom Flip camcorders dominate the market. Imagine, Cisco’s executives thought, if Pure Digital’s simplification wizards could be thrown at the task of simplifying the wireless router! Imagine if you could press one big red button to set the thing up, instead of spending a weekend futzing with S.S.I.D., WEP-2 and D.H.C.P. The new team’s mandate was this: “We want you to make it Flip easy.” The result is the new Cisco Valet ($100), a sleek, two-tone plastic wedge of a router. You’ll be hearing plenty about it; Cisco plans to spend more on advertising this thing in the next three months than the entire industry spent on Wi-Fi routers in the last five years. So how did the new team make the Valet Flip easy? Some of the efforts were psychological (which doesn’t necessarily mean ineffective). For example, the Valet comes in simple, white, uncluttered packaging. The off-putting word “router” doesn’t appear anywhere on it or inside it. (Instead, the box says, “The simple way to create your own wireless hot spot.” Good; most people have probably heard of a hot spot.) The Valet comes with a toll-free help line that’s available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Outstanding. The package opens like a cigar box; on the inside of the lid, you find the real masterstroke: a white U.S.B. flash drive. Each time you insert it into a Mac or a PC, that computer gets added to the network — no network name, passwords or decision-making required. This is a far cry from the usual ritual of inserting a setup CD, typing “admin” into your Web browser and encountering one form after another full of confusing abbreviations. (If any of that sounds familiar to you, well, my sympathies.) The software even names your new network for you. Your hot spot gets named something cute like HappyDog, MonkeyTree, TinyFish or PeachLion. (You can rename it if you’re gagging.) The software on the flash drive presents four easy-to-figure-out tiles. Click “Computers and devices” when you’re ready to add another machine to your network. Click “Parental controls” to limit your offspring’s access to the Web. (The Valet blocks both pornographic Web sites and individual sites that you specify. It also lets you restrict access to the Internet according to an hourly schedule — one for school days, one for weekends.) A third tile says “Guest access”; visitors to your house can use your hot spot to get online, just by typing the password that appears here. (They can’t see your files on the network; it’s an Internet-only account.) The fourth tile, “Valet settings,” opens the rabbit hole into the traditional Web page of technical Linksys router settings — I.P. addresses, port forwarding, D.N.S. servers and the like. This is all a huge improvement, yes. Bravo. Unfortunately, tragically, the Valet router is nowhere near Flip easy. Why tragic? Because this was the world’s one great hope for a truly simple router. It was Cisco’s big chance to go all the way — but it didn’t, and each shortfall hurts the mission. For example, a warning sticker comes on the jacks on the back. It says, “Plug in Easy Setup Key to get started,” followed by four lines of type that are too small to read. You’re led to believe that if you plug in the Valet first (instead of running the software on your PC), you’ll mess everything up. No product marketed for novices should begin your setup experience with a warning sticker — especially since, as a product manager confessed, it actually makes no difference whether you start with the Easy Setup Key or not. (This assumes, of course, that you even realize that “Easy Setup Key” refers to the flash drive in the box.)</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/20surveillance.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">In Bid to Sway Sales, Cameras Track Shoppers<date>Published: March 19, 2010</date><text>The curvy mannequin piqued the interest of a couple of lanky teenage boys. Little did they know that as they groped its tight maroon shirt in the clothing store that day, video cameras were rolling.At a mall, a father emerged from a store dragging his unruly young son by the scruff of the neck, as if he were the family cat. The man had no idea his parenting skills were being immortalized. At an office supply store, a mother decided to get an item from a high shelf by balancing her small child on her shoulders, unaware that she, too, was being recorded. These scenes may seem like random shopping bloopers, but they are meaningful to stores that are striving to engineer a better experience for the consumer, and ultimately, higher sales for themselves. Such clips, retailers say, can help them find solutions to problems in their stores — by installing seating and activity areas to mollify children, for instance, or by lowering shelves so merchandise is within easy reach. Privacy advocates, though, are troubled by the array of video cameras, motion detectors and other sensors monitoring the nation’s shopping aisles. Many stores and the consultants they hire are using the gear not to catch shoplifters but to analyze and to manipulate consumer behavior. And while taping shoppers is legal, critics say it is unethical to observe people as if they were lab rats. They are concerned that the practices will lead to an even greater invasion of privacy, particularly facial recognition technology, which is already in the early stages of deployment. Companies that employ this technology say it is used strictly to determine characteristics like age and gender, which help them discover how different people respond to various products. But privacy advocates fear that as the technology becomes more sophisticated, it will eventually cross the line and be used to identify individual consumers and gather more detailed information on them. “I think it is absolutely inevitable that this stuff is going to be linked to individuals,” said Katherine Albrecht, founder of Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering, an advocacy group. Some degree of privacy, experts say, is necessary as a matter of decency. “When someone’s watching me, I’m going to act differently than when I think I’m alone,” Ms. Albrecht said. “Did I pick my nose? What was I doing? What did they see?” Some stores use existing security systems for such monitoring and others have installed entirely new systems. The most basic surveillance setup has been around for a few years. It uses video cameras in ceilings and sensors near fitting rooms to learn how many customers pass through the doors and where they tend to go. At the other extreme, some retailers are taping shoppers’ every movement and using specialized analysis to study the shoppers’ behavior. For example, after seeing scores of customers struggle to navigate a particular area, analysts might suggest that the retailer widen the aisle. The companies that install and analyze video for retailers say that they are sensitive to privacy issues but that the concerns are overblown. They say they are not using the technology to identify consumers but to give them easier and more enjoyable shopping experiences. And, they added, they have the sales results to prove it. For example, Cisco Systems, the supplier of networking equipment, said one of its clients, the outdoor recreation retailer Cabela’s, installed cameras to monitor how long sales clerks took to approach customers. “Far fewer customers were being approached within their guidelines than they thought,” said Joanne Bethlahmy, a director at Cisco’s Internet business solutions group. Cabela’s took steps to change that, and performance improved. The chain said it was testing video analysis and plans to go ahead with it. Some of Cisco’s clients are also experimenting with facial recognition technology. Cisco executives noted, however, that the technology was used only to look for general characteristics. “It’s not looking at individuals,” Ms. Bethlahmy said. “It registers as ‘old versus young.’ ” Knowing that can help a retailer determine if a display is more appealing to men or to women, to baby boomers or members of Generation X. 1 2 Next Page »The curvy mannequin piqued the interest of a couple of lanky teenage boys.

Well, the Haggler has a corollary for consumerland: it’s never the manufacturing mistake, it’s the utterly appalling customer service that follows the manufacturing mistake.So the phrase doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. The Haggler will work on it. But here is a tale that demonstrates the maxim quite nicely. Q. Perhaps you’ve heard about those Flip mini video cameras that have been all the rage lately. Well, my parents gave me one in January to take videos of our newborn daughter, Sophie. Shortly afterward, I discovered that the U.S.B. arm — which connects the camcorder to a computer — doesn’t fit my MacBook Pro. After some online research, I learned that this was a widespread problem and that after an outcry, Cisco Systems, the maker of Flip, had offered to swap bad cameras for good ones. For me, that remedy proved elusive. Here are the details. Feb. 5: I call Flip customer support and am told that the company is aware of the issue, and waiting for new, repaired cameras. A rep says that when the shipment arrives, I will be sent a new camera. Feb. 16: I receive a voice mail from Flip customer support, saying that the new cameras have arrived, and that I will receive one, via UPS, in three to five business days. Feb. 17: I call Flip customer support to confirm, but I am disconnected by its automated phone system, twice, after waiting on hold for about 10 minutes each time. Feb. 26: I call Flip customer support again. It tells me that the camera was shipped and gives me a UPS tracking number. I check the number, and it is for a package that was delivered to California in November. I live in Brooklyn. And it’s February. I call back and talk to a different rep. She says that the first rep made a mistake, and that I am actually not in its system. Or, more precisely, tech support has me in the system, but the repair/fulfillment department does not. She says she can’t help because the repair department is in the process of moving to the Philippines. She said she would “try” to have someone call me back later with more information. [Haggler interruption: You really hate to hear “try” in this context, don’t you?] That’s the last I have heard from the company. I have to say, as customer service goes, this is pure slapstick. And all the while, Sophie goes unvideoed. David Leibowitz Brooklyn A. A very pleasant P.R. rep named Karen Sohl responded to the Haggler. In a call, she stressed that the number of faulty U.S.B. connectors was small, but that the exact number was hard to determine because the company counted only customers who got in touch directly, as opposed to returning the camera to a store. She also said the manufacturing error, which surfaced in December, was fixed by January. What she couldn’t explain was the clown-school steeplechase that Mr. Leibowitz ran in February. She said it was unacceptable and that she would investigate, but added in a somewhat surprising aside that she would also find out how much of this hassle was due to missteps by Mr. Leibowitz. The Haggler suppressed a chortle — which was not easy, dear readers — and suggested that perhaps Cisco was, in fact, moving its customer service operation to the Philippines in the midst of Mr. Leibowitz’s calls. Maybe the move discombobulated a service team that is otherwise highly combobulated. A few days after the initial contact with Ms. Sohl, the Haggler checked in with Mr. Leibowitz. By then, his Flip-related travails had included yet another call to Flip customer service and yet another chat with yet another rep. This one said that because the company was updating its system, it wasn’t possible to access phone records. So Mr. Leibowitz retold the entire story and was instructed to send in the receipt, which — oddly enough — was the first time he’d been asked for that particular document. But before he had a chance to call his parents, who have the receipt, Cisco shook off its torpor. “Out of the blue,” Mr. Leibowitz wrote on March 4, “I got a call from a customer service rep who told me they were overnighting me a new camera.” He added: “I was pretty shocked by this, but sure enough, on Friday, it arrived. I was wondering whether the Haggler might have been working behind the scenes.” Diligently, sir! Ms. Sohl was working, too, and during a second conversation, she had some background to this whole story. It seems that Cisco, which acquired Flip in June, had integrated its own customer service team with Flip’s in January, and the mishaps that Mr. Leibowitz experienced were results of merger pains. That UPS shipment to California? A rep had misspelled Mr. Leibowitz’s name, yielding the wrong tracking number. The company is now aware of these issues, Ms. Sohl said, and is “immediately implementing a new training process.” Mr. Leibowitz, meanwhile, is putting the camera to excellent use. A few days ago, he sent a video of his daughter, trying her level best to say “Thank you Haggler.” You can watch the video in the online version of this column, but fair warning: she’s 4 months old and still refining the art of the shout-out. So the phrase doesn’t exactly roll off her tongue.

Ms. Kamali is at the forefront of a technological transformation coming to many of the nation’s retailers. They are determined to strengthen the link between their physical stores and the Web, and to use technology to make shopping easier for consumers and more lucrative for themselves. The main way they plan to do it is by turning people’s mobile phones into information displays and ordering devices. Can’t find the flour at the grocery store? Grocers will offer phone applications that tell shoppers exactly where to go. Is the department store out of size 8 jeans? Retailers want to make it simple to punch a couple of buttons and have the desired size shipped home. Some supermarkets intend to offer real-time coupons while people shop. For example, a promotion for milk may be sent to a shopper’s mobile phone the moment her cart rolls into the dairy aisle. Drugstores will offer loyalty programs on cellphones, not on plastic cards. And specialty chains will allow shoppers to breeze through the aisles compiling a wedding registry, just by pointing at merchandise. It remains to be seen how readily shoppers will embrace such aggressive merchandising, which will generally require them to download free applications onto their phones and consent to being tracked electronically while in a store. But many stores are betting they will go along. After all, people already wander city streets guided by maps on their mobile phones. Why shouldn’t the same technology lead them to the toilet paper in Aisle 3? Hoping to use the technology as a competitive advantage, some big chains are reluctant to discuss their plans. The Sam’s Club division of Wal-Mart, Crate &amp; Barrel, Kerr Drug of North Carolina and Disney stores are among the retailers that confirmed they were testing various mobile technology or planned to do so soon. Technology companies behind the products say retailers are sniffing around, with some planning limited introductions this year and wider deployments in 2011 or 2012. Appropriately enough for a revered designer, Ms. Kamali is in the vanguard. A technology called ScanLife was installed at her boutique in recent weeks, and it already allows people to scan bar codes on merchandise and obtain details about the clothes through videos. The part about buying items day or night will come in another week or two. “To say that I’m excited is putting it mildly,” Ms. Kamali said. “I’ve been in this business since the ’60s and I have to just tell you, nothing  nothing at all  has been as powerful a change in the psyche of the way we do everything as this technology.” Other retailers have begun testing a product from I.B.M. called Presence. Shoppers who sign up can be detected as soon as they set foot in a store. That enables Presence to offer real-time mobile coupons. And tracking shoppers’ spending habits and browsing time in various departments can help the system figure out who might be moved to suddenly buy a discounted item. Presence can also make product recommendations. If a shopper was buying cake mix, Presence might suggest buying the store’s private-label frosting and sprinkles, too. “We’re also able to do predictive analytics  predict what we think you might want based on what we already know about you,” said Craig W. Stevenson, an I.B.M. executive who oversees Presence. Cisco Systems, the supplier of networking equipment and services for the Internet, is also a leader in the field. The company’s Mobile Concierge system is capable of connecting customers’ smartphones to retailers’ wireless networks  so a shopper could type “Cheez Whiz” into a cellphone, then pinpoint its location in the store. “We see the smartphone being used more and more in the shopping experience,” said Dick Cantwell, Cisco’s vice president for retail at Cisco’s Internet business solutions group. Beyond privacy worries, retailers recognize other potential pitfalls. If the phone applications freeze or give bad information, they will most likely frustrate consumers. So reliability will be a priority, a reason retailers are starting with limited tests. And as some executives said, many stores cannot yet afford such technology. As the more daring retailers see it, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. More aggressive profiling of shoppers  along with a novel, entertaining shopping experience  could help increase sales. And the technology may help retailers save money by cutting workers, essentially substituting electronic guidance for store clerks. Motorola, for example, has stores testing kiosk systems that enable consumers to summon a clerk to a particular department or fitting room when needed. A new Motorola product promises to eliminate loyalty cards, instead putting the program, as well as coupons, onto shoppers’ cellphones. “Probably by the end of 2010 we’ll have 10 to 20 retailers up and running,” said Frank Riso, a senior director at Motorola, adding that most of the activity will begin in 2011. Many big retailers have already created cellphone applications that do more than just dole out coupons. Target, for one, has an application that can identify which store aisle sells nightgowns. So far, many stores have focused on improving their mobile shopping sites, which some consumers use when browsing the aisles to see product reviews and specifications. Retailers like Sears and American Eagle Outfitters work with a company called Usablenet to optimize their mobile sites. Jason Taylor, Usablenet’s vice president for mobile products, said retailers began clamoring for improvements around Thanksgiving. The company is also working with a retailer, which it said it could not name, to enable shoppers to use smartphones to scan items in its stores, then add them to gift registries. “Extending the phone to use as a scanner in the retail world  especially gift registry, wish lists  you’re going to see a lot more of this year,” Mr. Taylor said. In the end, though, stores may not have much control over the way consumers use mobile technology. Some shoppers are already outwitting retailers, using mobile applications like RedLaser to compare prices in a physical store to those on the Web. (Such applications scan product bar codes through a cellphone’s camera.) Ben Aldern, 20, of Berkeley, Calif., went to Target recently to shop for headphones. “I was ready to spend whatever I needed,” he said, but on a hunch, he fired up RedLaser  and found the same model for less at Amazon, the online merchant. “Once I saw I could save 20 bucks,” he said, “Target lost me.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 27, 2010, on page A1 of the New York edition.Shoppers will soon be able to stand outside the designer Norma Kamali’s boutique in Manhattan, point a phone at merchandise in the window and buy it  even late at night when the store is closed.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Rodney Adkins, senior vice president for systems and technology at I.B.M., which is ahead in developing customized systems. Suppliers are offering customers assembled bundles of hardware and software to make it easier and less expensive for customers to cope with the Internet-era surge in data  an information flood coming from internal databases, but also from Web-based collaboration and smartphone applications, sensors that monitor electrical use, environmental contamination and food shipments, even biological and genetic research. The shift to packaging hardware and software together is behind the recent big deals and partnerships in the technology industry: Oracle’s purchase of Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, an alliance between Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft announced last month, and a similar partnership between Cisco Systems and EMC. But computer scientists at universities and technology companies say that simply putting the hardware and software building blocks together more efficiently for customers is not enough. “The huge challenge is to take all this data and generate useful knowledge from it,” said Kunle Olukotun, a computer scientist at Stanford. “It’s an enormous opportunity in science and business, but it also presents a massive computing problem.” The path to intelligently mining the explosion of data, Mr. Olukotun said, involves new approaches to breaking down computing tasks into subtasks that can be processed simultaneously  a concept known as parallel computing  and new system designs optimized for specific kinds of work. Designing computer systems around the work to be done is a departure from the dominant approach of general-purpose design, in which machines are built to be capable of handling all kinds of chores and are then programmed to do specific tasks. Several companies are beginning to bring workload-optimized systems design into the mainstream of corporate and government computing. The promise, analysts say, is to not only open the door to exploiting the data flood for competitive advantage, but also to reduce energy costs and help automate the management and administration of computer systems  a labor-intensive expense that is rising four times faster than the cost of hardware. I.B.M., according to industry analysts, is at the forefront of the effort to develop more customized systems. And on Monday, the company is making the first of a series of announcements this year that embody the new approach. I.B.M. is introducing a line of big computer servers using its Power 7 32-core microprocessors. They are priced at $190,000, typically run Unix or Linux, and are aimed at industries like finance and utilities, as well as scientific researchers. Next month, I.B.M. plans to unveil far less costly server systems based on industry-standard microprocessors made by Intel. Those machines, which typically run Unix or Microsoft Windows, will be used for Web collaboration, e-mail and other applications. “These are not simply hardware products, but the result of years of work and investment at every level from the silicon up through the software,” said Rodney C. Adkins, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for systems and technology. “And the real challenge is to optimize it all, not just the hardware.” The early deployment of so-called smart utility grids points to the challenges of handling ever-vaster amounts of data. Smart electric meters can measure room temperatures and energy use hourly or at 15-minute intervals instead of the old pattern of utility service workers reading electro-mechanical meters every month or two. The goal of smart grids, which governments are starting to heavily subsidize, is to give households and businesses timely information so they can change their electricity consumption habits to reduce energy use and pollution, and save money. That involves not only collecting the data, but also analyzing and presenting it to consumers in ways that are easily understood  typically a personalized Web site graphically showing household electricity consumption and pricing. EMeter, a maker of smart-grid software in San Mateo, Calif., said that using I.B.M.’s workload-tuned P-7 systems should more than double its capacity to manage smart meters, bringing it up to 50 million. In one eMeter project, the utilities in Ontario are going to install 4.5 million smart meters by 2011. Before, meters were read once every month or two. Under the digital system, readings will be made hourly, a hundredfold increase in the data generated. “If you can’t continually measure energy use down to the granular level in homes and businesses, the smart grid doesn’t work,” said Scott Smith, director of technical solutions at eMeter. “You need a tremendous amount of computing power to do that at scale.” Computer scientists, biologists and researchers from Rice University and the Texas Medical Center have been working with I.B.M. scientists to fine-tune P-7 systems for cancer research. Genetic and protein-folding simulations require vast amounts of specialized high-speed processing and computer memory, said Kamran Khan, vice provost for information technology at Rice. I.B.M., he said, dispatched three Ph.D. biologists to work with the cancer researchers. “They really understand computational biology,” Mr. Khan said. The more bespoke approach to computer-systems design does increase the risk that customers are locked into one or two powerful companies. Indeed, the reason data-center customers long preferred the building-block approach to hardware and software was that it guaranteed competition among suppliers. But the tradeoff has been that customers had to put the hardware and software together themselves, even as computing complexity and data-handling demands surged. Many companies, it seems, are willing to accept less competition among suppliers for the convenience and cost savings from prepackaged systems. “It’s a balancing act,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst at IDC. “It does take away some choice, but also makes things a lot simpler. And that, after all, is the model that Apple used so successfully in consumer technology.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on February 8, 2010, on page B4 of the New York edition.In data-center computing, the big trend today is to move from building blocks to bundles.

Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, prides himself on forecasting technology and economic shifts ahead of his company’s peers and competitors. On Wednesday, Mr. Chambers declared that spending on technology had moved to a higher gear, reflecting a much healthier global economy. In response, Cisco plans to hire up to 3,000 people over the next several quarters. His optimism about the economy, expressed as the company released strong second-quarter financial results, stood out even among the generally upbeat talk from executives at other technology companies in recent weeks. Customers have demonstrated more consistent and widespread demand for Cisco’s networking equipment, Mr. Chambers said in an interview. “There was major momentum. It was quite remarkably balanced across the board, and you would say we are on our way to a reasonably good recovery.” Cisco plans to adjust to the improved conditions by increasing its internal spending on nascent businesses and adding to its current work force of about 66,000. Last month, other technology heavyweights, including Intel, Microsoft and I.B.M., beat Wall Street expectations as sales of their flagship products and services improved at higher-than-expected rates. The quarterly results of those companies painted a picture of technology spending through the end of last year. On Wednesday, Cisco, whose products are used by a wide range of businesses and some consumers, provided a peek at technology spending in the new year when it reported results for the quarter that ended Jan. 24. Cisco’s net income increased 23.2 percent, to $1.85 billion, or 32 cents a share, from $1.5 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding charges for stock-option compensation and one-time items, Cisco earned 40 cents a share. The company reported healthier sales as well, with revenue increasing 8 percent, to $9.82 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had predicted that Cisco would earn 35 cents a share, excluding charges, on sales of $9.41 billion. Mr. Chambers said that his recent talks with government leaders and customers had convinced him of a shared optimism around the globe. “We are already in the second phase of a capital spending increase,” he said. For the current quarter, Cisco said it expected revenue to increase 23 to 26 percent from the $8.2 billion it reported in the period a year ago. In previous quarters, Cisco had reported pockets of stronger sales around the globe and strength with certain product lines. Mr. Chambers said the big difference this time around was that customers throughout the world increased their orders at the same time. Cisco reported higher sales in 8 of the top 15 countries it sells to, up from 2 out of 15 in the previous quarter. Erik Suppiger, an analyst with Signal Hill, noted that Cisco had in fact struggled to meet the rising orders of customers. “They had product shortages across a number of lines,” he said. Cisco, which has $39.6 billion in cash and investments on hand, has been one of the most aggressive acquirers in the technology industry. In the last year alone, the company spent more than $7 billion as it sought to advance its Internet video and wireless data product lines. Mr. Chambers has declared a rise in video on personal computers and cellphones part of the next phase of the Internet. Such cheerleading comes naturally to him, because Cisco looks to sell more routers and switches to deal with the large files produced by video systems. In addition, Cisco makes video-conferencing systems for businesses and Flip video cameras for the consumer market. Cisco has used the lull created by the economic downturn to increase its investment in areas that are still nascent, like business and Web software, where it trails Microsoft and I.B.M. by a wide margin in both market share and reputation. With sales of its core products once again on the rise, Cisco’s move into these smaller businesses is likely to come under more scrutiny from investors looking for growth, analysts said. “The proof will be showing traction on some of these new products and initiatives,” said Jeffrey Evenson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “This is the year where their ability to execute will become more apparent.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on February 4, 2010, on page B10 of the New York edition.John T.

However, the biggest donor has been Ms. Whitman herself, who has donated $39 million from her personal fortune to boost her campaign coffers. While her campaign war chest is growing, it seems that Ms. Whitman isn’t at loss for how to spend it: the former eBay chief burned through $19.5 million a full year ahead of the general election, citing campaign finance reports filed Monday. That figure compares with $3.7 million in spent in 2009 by California’s insurance commissioner, Steve Poizner, who is challenging Ms. Whitman for the Republican nomination, while the famously frugal Jerry Brown, the state attorney general and presumed Democratic nominee, spent just $137,000 in his unofficial quest to return to the office he held for two terms in the 1970s and early 1980s. Documents filed with the California secretary of state’s office showed that Ms. Whitman spent generously to bankroll a large campaign team, ran a series of statewide radio ads introducing herself to voters and held fund-raisers that netted $10 million in contributions. Corporate titans were among Ms. Whitman’s biggest donors, including $25,900 each — the maximum donation per election cycle — from Cisco Systems‘ chief executive, John Chambers; eBay‘s chief executive, John Donahoe; and a slew of venture capitalists and hedge fund managers. Ms. Whitman took in more than $850,000 from out-of-state donors in the second half of the year as she crisscrossed the country hosting fund-raisers from Florida to New York. The G.O.P. contest this June is expected to become the most expensive primary in California history. Ms. Whitman has said she could spend more than $100 million in her quest to become governor. A Democratic consultant, Steve Maviglio, told The Sacramento Bee that Ms. Whitman is “burning through her money like a drunken sailor.” The Los Angeles Times said that on top of the cash Ms. Whitman has paid for her radio spots, “the 53-year old Whitman has spent freely on just about everything: chartered jets, a gold-plated Website and a phalanx of campaign staff and political strategists that cost her more than $7.2 million last year.” However, the newspaper noted that Ms. Whitman was unapologetic about her outlay. “Our campaign budget is designed for one purpose: to deliver victory on Election Day,” Ms. Whitman said in a statement. Mr. Poizner, meanwhile, has given his campaign nearly $19 million so far and spent $3.7 million. Monday’s filing shows the former Silicon Valley entrepreneur has raised about $2 million from donors and ended the year with $17.7 million in the bank. And while Mr. Brown has yet to declare his candidacy, he is collecting large donations from American Indian tribes and labor unions. His donors also include Hollywood celebrities like Dreamworks founders Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and Netflix‘s founder, Reed Hastings. Mr. Brown raised nearly $12 million in 2009 but spent just $137,000. Mr. Brown has since hired a modestly sized campaign staff. Monday was the deadline for political candidates and groups to file their end-of-the-year campaign fund-raising and spending statements. Among the committees filing Monday was Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s California Dream Team, which he uses to fund ballot-measure campaigns. It reported spending more than $7 million last year, most of it on last May’s failed special election campaign for a package of budget fixes. Since July, the Dream Team has raised less than $500,000 and ended the year with about $600,000 on hand. Schwarzenegger is expected to campaign this year for an $11.1 billion water bond on the November ballot. Two committees that are proposing to hold a constitutional convention to reform state government, Repair California and California Forward, reported having a combined $300,000 at the end of 2009 as they push to get an initiative on the November ballot. A committee backing another initiative likely to draw attention in 2010, a measure to legalize and tax marijuana, reported raising and spending $1.3 million last year. Tax Cannabis 2010 submitted signatures last month to qualify an initiative on the November ballot. The group ended the year with $32,000 cash on hand. In a sign they are likely to wait until 2012 to revisit the debate over gay marriage in California, groups that are seeking to overturn the 2008 vote restricting marriage to one man and one woman dramatically slowed their fund-raising efforts toward the end of 2009. Equality California, which led the ”No on 8” campaign against Proposition 8, raised less than $7,000 in the final six months of the year, leaving it with $608,935 in the bank at year’s end. The Courage Campaign, a Los Angeles-based gay-rights organization, reported just $345 cash on hand. The group ProtectMarriage.com, which supported the ban on gay marriage, reported raising less than $18,500 in the second half of the year. It had $218,000 banked at year’s end after paying $70,635 to political consultants.

The $7.4 billion deal, which gives Oracle a vast hardware business for the first time, pits it against Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Dell and Cisco Systems, all of which have made a flurry of acquisitions and alliances. Many of these moves broadened the companies' products and services from their traditional specialties, like databases, computers or networking equipment. Each company wants to be able to claim to prospective customers that it, and it alone, has more of the parts to be an end-to-end service provider. ''The cost isn't in buying the pieces,'' Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''The cost is in the labor of assembling them and making them work.'' On Wednesday, Oracle will hold an event at its Silicon Valley headquarters where executives from the company will talk in detail about the plans for Sun Microsystems. Mr. Ellison said that in the next few months, Oracle planned to lay off fewer than 2,000 people, while hiring more than 2,000 people in engineering, sales and other roles. He did not rule out that additional layoffs might occur later. Mr. Ellison added that he expected Sun's chief executive, Jonathan I. Schwartz, to resign and that he hoped that Scott G. McNealy, Sun's co-founder and chairman, would stay on at Oracle, although his title and duties were not clear. ''We need to have more conversations about his role,'' Mr. Ellison said. Oracle's purchase of Sun, which European regulators approved last week after months of scrutiny, stands out as the most game-changing corporate technology play made during the economic downturn, according to industry analysts. ''It's the most significant deal of the decade,'' said Dan Olds, an analyst with Gabriel Consulting. ''Oracle has a shot here to change the rules of the industry and usher in a new era.'' As analysts like Mr. Olds point out, the era is new only in relative terms. The corporate computing market began decades ago with I.B.M. selling customers systems that included most of the hardware and software they would need in a single package. As time went on, a host of minicomputer makers rose to prominence with a similar strategy, in which they would build all of the crucial pieces of a large system, including its chips, main software and networking technology. The older model of selling corporate systems was then disrupted by the rise of powerful, more standardized computers based on readily available chips from Intel and an innovative software market. Customers could suddenly choose the technology they preferred from a variety of suppliers and assemble those products in their own data centers. Prices of hardware and software declined under this competitive pressure. Oracle, for one, wants to revert to the more traditional model. The company plans to offer customers databases, business software, servers, storage systems and networking equipment from one place. In addition, Oracle will do the hard engineering work to make sure all this technology works well together, Mr. Ellison said. ''It is odd that the computer industry ships all these separate parts and expects customers to assemble them,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''You will now be buying this complete system, and don't have to hire I.B.M. or someone else to assemble it for you.'' While Oracle has long battled I.B.M. in the database market, its push into computer hardware places the company in direct competition with longtime partners like H.P. and Dell. Last year, Cisco Systems branched out from its roots as the world's largest networking company and began selling computer servers -- a move that pitted it against H.P., Dell and I.B.M. Cisco also formed a sales partnership with EMC and its software subsidiary VMware that further fanned competition. Traditionally, Cisco had teamed with H.P., Dell and I.B.M. in large data center deals.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/technology/20code.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Fearing Hackers Who Leave No Trace<date>Correction: January 27, 2010Published: January 19, 2010</date><text>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  The crown jewels of Google, Cisco Systems or any other technology company are the millions of lines of programming instructions, known as source code, that make its products run.

If hackers could steal those key instructions and copy them, they could easily dull the company’s competitive edge in the marketplace. More insidiously, if attackers were able to make subtle, undetected changes to that code, they could essentially give themselves secret access to everything the company and its customers did with the software. The fear of someone building such a back door, known as a Trojan horse, and using it to conduct continual spying is why companies and security experts were so alarmed by Google’s disclosure last week that hackers based in China had stolen some of its intellectual property and had conducted similar assaults on more than two dozen other companies. “Originally we were saying, ‘Well, whoever got it has the secret sauce to Google and some 30 other California companies, and they can replicate it,’ ” said Rick Howard, director of security intelligence at VeriSign iDefense, which helped companies investigate the Chinese attacks. “But some of the more devious folks in our outfit were saying, ‘Well, they could also insert their own code  and they probably have.’ ” For example, a foreign intelligence agency might find it extremely useful to know who was asking particular questions of Google’s search engine. Security researchers took particular interest in the fact that the Silicon Valley company Adobe Systems was one of the companies hit by the recent wave of attacks. Computer users around the globe have Adobe’s Acrobat or Reader software sitting on their machines to create or read documents, and Adobe’s Flash technology is widely used to present multimedia content on the Web and mobile phones. “Acrobat is installed on about 95 percent of the machines in the world, and there have been a lot of vulnerabilities found in Flash,” said Jeff Moss, a security expert who sits on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. “If you can find a vulnerability in one of these products, you’re golden.” Products from Microsoft, including Windows, Office and Internet Explorer, have long been favored targets for hackers because so many people use them. But McAfee, a leading software security firm, predicts that Adobe’s software will become the top target this year, as Microsoft has improved its products after years of attacks and Adobe’s software has become ubiquitous. Adobe said it was still investigating the attacks but so far had no evidence that any sensitive information had been compromised. Brad Arkin, the director of product security at Adobe, said the company generally expected to face increasing attention from hackers given the growing popularity of its products. But he added that the company employed industry-leading practices to respond to threats. “The security of our customers will always be a critical priority for Adobe,” he said. Given the complexity of today’s software programs, which are typically written by teams of hundreds or thousands of engineers, it is virtually impossible to be perfectly confident in the security of any program, and tampering could very well go undetected. Companies are understandably reluctant to discuss their security failures. But one notable episode shows just how damaging the secret tampering with source code can be. Before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, an unidentified hacker inserted secret programs into four telephone switching computers operated by the Vodafone Group, the world’s largest cellphone carrier. The programs created a clandestine tapping system that allowed unknown snoops to eavesdrop on cellphone calls and track the location of about 100 prominent Greek citizens, including then-Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, military officials, the mayor of Athens, activists and journalists. The infiltration was uncovered in a government investigation after a Vodafone engineer was found dead in 2005 under suspicious circumstances. Although the recent round of attacks against Google and other companies appears to have come from China, the threat is not limited to that country, according to computer security researchers. A host of nations, private corporations and even bands of rogue programmers are capable of covertly tunneling into information systems. “Our conventional military dominance drives our adversaries to cheat, lie and steal,” said James Gosler, a fellow at Sandia National Laboratories and a visiting scientist at the National Security Agency, in a speech last year to Pentagon employees. “The offensive technical capability to play this game is well within the reach of the principal adversaries of the United States. In fact, one could argue that some of our adversaries are better at this game than we are.” Over the years, Chinese attackers have shown the most interest in military and technology-related assets, leaving assaults on financial systems to hackers in Russia and Eastern European countries. A look at the source code of software at a company like Adobe or Cisco can help attackers find new ways to burrow into products before the companies can fix errors in their software. In addition, the hackers can gain insights into how to insert their own code into the software so that they can have ready access to machines down the road. “One of the U.S. government’s biggest worries is that the attackers will place that source code back into products,” said George Kurtz, the chief technology officer at McAfee. For example, the widespread appearance of counterfeit Cisco routers, which direct traffic on computer networks, has become a major concern in recent years. Cisco is required by law to include technology in its networking products that allows investigators to tap the hardware for information. The fear is that a country like China could sell counterfeit routers containing slightly modified software that would allow hackers to dial into the systems. “That could provide the perfect over-the-shoulder view of everything coming out of a network,” Mr. Moss said. A Cisco spokesman, Terry Alberstein, said that the company had extensively tested counterfeit Cisco routers. “We have not found a single instance of software or hardware that was modified to make them more vulnerable to security threats,” he said. Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a security education organization, said American technology companies had gotten better about protecting their most prized intellectual property by creating more complex systems for viewing and changing source code. Such systems can keep a detailed account of what tweaks have been made to a software product. But such security can be undermined by employees who open malicious files sent to them in e-mail, said Mr. Kurtz. “One of the greatest vulnerabilities remains the people element,” he added.

The New York Times reported in November that Motorola had tapped JPMorgan Chase, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs to seek buyers for its division that manufactures set-top boxes for cable television companies and radios, as well as mobile phone networking gear. But the division has received lower-than-expected bids, while an uptick in mobile phone handsets sales also has Motorola examining whether its handset and networking businesses should stay under a single parent, The Journal said. Motorola had been expecting the unit to fetch $4 billion to $5 billion, but bids have been closer to $3 billion to $4 billion, the newspaper said. While second-round bids are due in February, Motorola management is expected to meet with the board in the coming days to discuss the future of the business, The Journal said. In 2008, Motorola, based in Schaumberg, Ill., said it wanted to separate its struggling cellphone handset unit from the rest of the company, which includes a third business unit that sells two-way radios to businesses and government agencies. The company then reportedly started mulling a sale of the set-top box unit, as its prospects dimmed, in part from more aggressive competition from its main rival, Cisco Systems, and others. Motorola got into the cable box business in 2000, when it acquired General Instruments for $17 billion.

But I left out a big area that tech investors are excited about: health care. “It’s the next great horizon for the venture industry,” said Michael Greeley, a general partner at Flybridge Capital Partners in Boston. Start-ups are making devices and robots that do some of the work that doctors and nurses used to do. For example, Flybridge has invested in PolyRemedy, a company that makes robots that dress patients’ wounds in the hospital. Another Flybridge company, MicroChips, is developing an implantable sensor that wirelessly and continuously tracks diabetic patients’ glucose levels. Mobile devices could also transform the way that patients are monitored and treated. “I think Apple frankly is going to blaze the way from a consumer perspective, Mr. Greeley said. “You can see your iPhone becoming a hub of your medical info.” Already, software start-ups are helping insurers and doctors care for patients remotely, for instance, by grouping them based on age and condition and sending automatic alerts by e-mail or text messages, Mr. Greeley said. Others companies, including Cisco and American Well, connect doctors and patients using video chat over the Web. “The doctor becomes the concierge to the patient, rather than the doctor being the center of the system and the patient having to travel to hospitals,” Mr. Greeley said. The technology is there, but doctors have to catch up. A story published Thursday in The Times discussed how doctors are lagging in technology in terms of using virtual visits.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/microsoft-is-losing-fight-for-consumers-analyst-says/?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Microsoft Is Losing Fight for Consumers, Analyst Says<date>December 10, 2009, 10:00 pm</date><text>Mark Anderson is the writer behind the Strategic News Service, a predictive newsletter with a wide following among technology executives and venture capitalists, which he publishes from the island redoubt of Friday Harbor, Wash. And each December, he comes to New York, hosts a dinner and delivers a set of forecasts for the coming year. Kimberly White/Reuters Mark Anderson The dinner was at the Waldorf-Astoria on Thursday night, but I caught up with Mr. Anderson earlier for a preview of his after-dinner performance. One of his predictions, in particular, caught my attention. “Except for gaming, it is ‘game over’ for Microsoft in the consumer market,” he said. “It’s time to declare Microsoft a loser in phones. Just get out of Dodge.” Regardless of Microsoft’s performance, amid the rise of Apple‘s iPhone and phones using Google‘s Android software, it seems unlikely Microsoft will heed Mr. Anderson’s advice. The smartphone is becoming the innovative hub of software development and applications, far more so than the personal computer. If Microsoft loses in smartphones, Mr. Anderson noted, “It is pretty grim. Those applications are going to move upstream.” The underlying problem, Mr. Anderson said, is cultural. “Phones are consumer items, and Microsoft doesn’t have consumer DNA,” he said. “Walk the halls at Microsoft and you can see it is not a place that gets consumers,” Mr. Anderson said. “Just as if you walk the halls at Google, it’s obvious it is not a place that gets the enterprise world.” Unlike many, Mr. Anderson does not see cloud computing as a unifying force that would make consumer and business technology increasingly similar. “The computer world is splitting apart, into two separate continents, consumer and enterprise,” he said. In the consumer camp are Apple, Google and most of the Asian hardware makers, Mr. Anderson said. In the enterprise camp (large companies and government agencies) will reside I.B.M., Dell, Cisco and Microsoft. Hewlett-Packard, he said, will straddle both worlds.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/technology/personaltech/10flip.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Flip Offers a Wireless Way to Get Videos From PC to TV<date>Published: December 9, 2009</date><text>Roughly three million people use a Flip, the pocket-size camcorder from Cisco that has spawned a new category of video devices that are one-button simple.

TV ads for Flip close with the Cisco logo. AS the company that makes the plumbing of the Internet, Cisco Systems rakes in the cash, but it is hardly a top technology brand among consumers, in the way of Apple or Microsoft. While it specializes in corporate equipment, Cisco does, in fact, sell some consumer gear. The problem is that Cisco’s efforts to hawk such products have been lackluster. (Ever heard of Cisco’s home stereos? Exactly.) But with its acquisition in March of Pure Digital, the tiny manufacturer of Flip video cameras, Cisco is finally getting serious about its consumer marketing efforts.  About the size of a smartphone, the Flip devices brought a refreshing level of simplicity to the video market. Millions of people who had shied away from complex and clunky camcorders suddenly decided they needed to document their lives via video. Cisco’s initial efforts to market the Flip after the purchase were sometimes awkward. For example, an early effort to create a viral video featured Cisco’s chief executive, John T. Chambers, demonstrating duck calls in his office. Now, however, Cisco seems to have found its way with the Flip. A couple of weeks ago, the company began putting out 10-second television commercials and Web clips that show snippets from the lives of both celebrities and “regular people.” The spots for Flip include a nod at the end to Cisco, when the company logo appears. “We get unsolicited e-mails from people all over the country telling us how excited they were to capture some moment,” said Jodi Lipe, the Cisco executive who spearheaded the campaign. “We wanted to capture that authenticity in our television campaign.” Some of the ads appear to document the banal. For example, there is one of a man picking at his bacon and eggs with a fork, and another of someone brushing his teeth. The obligatory parental video of baby with food dangling from her mouth? It’s there. But, look more closely, and you’ll find that the authenticity of Cisco’s campaign comes with some caveats. The man brushing his teeth is the singer Lenny Kravitz. One of the most popular clips  four guys singing an ode to hamburgers in their car  turns out to be the creation of budding marketers from Hollywood. Cisco hired a San Francisco marketing firm called Urgent Content to find people willing to share their Flip tales. Urgent Content has a database of what Brandon Gross, one of its founders, described as “creative consumers.” “It is a network of creatives that we have worked with in past projects we have done,” Mr. Gross said. “Most of these people have Flip cameras, and, if not, we seeded them with the cameras.” The burger boys live in Los Angeles, where they have various jobs touching the entertainment industry, from writing screenplays to directing music videos. The high school chums have been trying to drum up business as viral marketers who can create funny, low-cost videos for clients through their Web site, the Bajillionaires Club. Urgent Content asked the burger crew to come up with some “low-key, genuine organic moments,” said Bryan Madole, who appeared in the video. So they stuck their Flip recorder to the windshield of a car with a piece of chewing gum and sang about hamburgers. “Urgent gave us the parameters, but we came up with the moment,” Mr. Madole said.  Cisco has paid the everyday people what it calls a nominal fee for their efforts. Meanwhile, celebrities like Mr. Kravitz, the skateboard king Tony Hawk, the pop idol Usher and the comedian Stephen Colbert received no payment, although in some 15-second TV spots that will start airing this month they can use the last five seconds of the ad to plug a product or a charity. For example, Gabrielle Reece, the volleyball player turned model turned fitness guru, will use her five seconds to promote her HoneyLine Web site aimed at women. In an interview, Ms. Reece said that making her video, which shows her swimming underwater, didn’t require much work. “I already had a Flip and tons of footage,” she said. “It’s not like I had to do a special photo shoot.” Cisco declined to release any detailed data about the effectiveness of the campaign so far, although views of the clips on the company’s official YouTube channel have in most cases attracted dozens, rather than thousands. Executives from the various companies that worked on the Flip campaign promoted it as revolutionary, particularly for its use of the rough, 10-second spots, which run counter to more polished, traditional 30-second ads. But in fact, these types of “authentic” campaigns have become rather common as companies try to piggyback on the rise of everyday people making their own videos and other content. During the last Super Bowl, for example, a pair of Doritos ads created by consumers was shown. CoreBrand, which has Cisco as a client, has been studying the company’s efforts to crack the consumer market. “Historically, they’ve been burnt pretty bad with consumer efforts,” said Timothy Robinson, a managing director at CoreBrand. “They were always seen as overpriced.” Still, the public’s familiarity with Cisco’s brand has risen over the last year, and it jumped even more since it bought the Flip line. “The Flip stuff is trying to overcome that perception of arrogance and pricey products through these irreverent, quick bits of communication,” Mr. Robinson said.

TV ads for Flip close with the Cisco logo. AS the company that makes the plumbing of the Internet, Cisco Systems rakes in the cash, but it is hardly a top technology brand among consumers, in the way of Apple or Microsoft. While it specializes in corporate equipment, Cisco does, in fact, sell some consumer gear. The problem is that Cisco’s efforts to hawk such products have been lackluster. (Ever heard of Cisco’s home stereos? Exactly.) But with its acquisition in March of Pure Digital, the tiny manufacturer of Flip video cameras, Cisco is finally getting serious about its consumer marketing efforts.  About the size of a smartphone, the Flip devices brought a refreshing level of simplicity to the video market. Millions of people who had shied away from complex and clunky camcorders suddenly decided they needed to document their lives via video. Cisco’s initial efforts to market the Flip after the purchase were sometimes awkward. For example, an early effort to create a viral video featured Cisco’s chief executive, John T. Chambers, demonstrating duck calls in his office. Now, however, Cisco seems to have found its way with the Flip. A couple of weeks ago, the company began putting out 10-second television commercials and Web clips that show snippets from the lives of both celebrities and “regular people.” The spots for Flip include a nod at the end to Cisco, when the company logo appears. “We get unsolicited e-mails from people all over the country telling us how excited they were to capture some moment,” said Jodi Lipe, the Cisco executive who spearheaded the campaign. “We wanted to capture that authenticity in our television campaign.” Some of the ads appear to document the banal. For example, there is one of a man picking at his bacon and eggs with a fork, and another of someone brushing his teeth. The obligatory parental video of baby with food dangling from her mouth? It’s there. But, look more closely, and you’ll find that the authenticity of Cisco’s campaign comes with some caveats. The man brushing his teeth is the singer Lenny Kravitz.

More details here. Cisco Systems says it is waiving its condition that 90 percent of shareholders of Norwegian videoconferencing equipment firm Tandberg back its $3.4 billion takeover offer and will close the deal as soon as possible. Cisco, the world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment, said holders of 89 percent of Tandberg shares had agreed to the company’s offer of $30.32 a share as of Thursday, when the bid expired following a two-day extension. That is just shy of the 90 percent threshold Cisco had set to complete the acquisition. Cisco, based in San Jose, has struggled to gain shareholder approval of the deal. It sweetened the offer on Nov. 16 after its original bid of about $3 billion was approved by Tandberg’s board but attracted less than 10 percent of the Norwegian company’s shareholders. When tendering the new bid, Cisco said 40 percent of Tandberg’s shareholders backed the new offer, including the largest minority shareholders — Folketrygdfondet, Norway’s domestic pension fund, and OppenheimerFunds. Earlier this week, as acceptances crept up to 84 percent, the company said it would decide Thursday whether to withdraw the offer or waive the 90 percent condition. The waiver will lead to negotiations with the remaining shareholders. Cisco has been focusing on the high end of the videoconferencing market, selling so-called ”TelePresence” systems with multiple plasma screens that present life-size images of the participants to provide the illusion of face-to-face communication. With Tandberg, Cisco will get the leading maker of video systems ranging from small ”videophones” to full conference room setups. The deal also will let the company spend some of the cash that has been piling up in its overseas subsidiaries. By buying an international company, Cisco will avoid the United States taxes it would have had to pay to bring the money home.

Cisco said Wednesday that it wouldn’t extend its $3.4 billion offer, which expires Thursday afternoon, and that it may “waive” the 90 percent threshold. If Cisco meets the threshold, it can automatically buy out the rest of Tandberg’s minority owners.

The new bid was backed by holders of more than 40 percent of Tandberg’s shares. Cisco’s new offer of 170 kroner ($30.35) a share is up from a 153.50 kroner bid that more than 90 percent of Tandberg shareholders had dismissed, and values the company at nearly 19 billion kroner ($3.39 billion). Few analysts expected Cisco to walk away after the earlier offer, as it had repeatedly said that online videoconferencing was an important growth area, especially as companies tried to cut costs on travel during the downturn. Tandberg shares rose 3.6 percent to 163.20 kroner in European trading. “I think they will get Tandberg at 170” kroner, said Anita Huun, an analyst at Handelsbanken. Panta Capital, a London investment consulting firm that had called the initial bid too low, said the new offer was fair and likely to succeed. “I think it’s a done deal now,” said Peter Germonpre, managing director of Panta. Mr. Germonpre said the new offer was more in line with the valuation of another major videoconferencing equipment provider, Polycom. He said the small group of shareholders whose views he had represented in his earlier statement would be much more inclined to tender their shares. Cisco said the offer, which expires on Dec. 1, was backed by Tandberg’s two largest shareholders, Folketrygdfondet funds and Oppenheimer Funds, and had received acceptances from owners of more than 40 percent of its stock. The new offer represents the “final price for this transaction,” Cisco said in a statement.

''The terms and conditions set out in the offer document remain in place during the extended offer period,'' Cisco said in a statement. Cisco's chief executive, John T. Chambers, said last week that he believed the Tandberg deal would be closed but threatened to drop the offer after investors holding about 30 percent of Tandberg shares demanded a higher price than the 153.50 kroner a share ($27.61) offered by Cisco. Tandberg's directors have recommended the offer be accepted. Its shares closed up 0.5 percent at 151.80 kroner. Cisco made its offer for Tandberg -- its first effort at a public European takeover -- conditional on 90 percent acceptance. It was not immediately clear how many shares were tendered before Cisco extended the deadline. Analysts have said Cisco's offer, regardless of when and how it closed, could prompt more deals involving videoconferencing companies, like the No. 2 player, Polycom. Other technology companies like Hewlett-Packard also offer high-end videoconferencing. Many analysts had expected Cisco to raise its bid, as acquiring the market leader in videoconferencing would accelerate its push in selling video equipment and software.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/technology/companies/05cisco.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco’s Results Offer More Hope to Tech Industry<date>Published: November 4, 2009</date><text>Cisco Systems, the computer networking giant, supplied more evidence on Wednesday that technology sales were recovering along with the global economy. Skip to next paragraph Related Cisco and EMC Form Venture to Serve Data Centers (November 4, 2009) Cisco is the latest large technology company to report better-than-expected quarterly profits, and it expressed optimism that the improving trend would continue. “The recovery, at least the initial phase of the recovery, is under way,” John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. Yet despite the signs of strength and continuing improvement in the current quarter, Cisco executives declined to offer any forecasts for 2010, citing the uncertain economic outlook for next year. Cisco reported net income in its first quarter, which ended Oct. 24, of $1.8 billion, or 30 cents a share, down 19 percent from a year ago. Excluding charges for stock-option compensation, acquisitions and one-time items, Cisco earned 36 cents a share, well ahead of the Wall Street estimate of 31 cents. It reported revenue of $9 billion, a 13 percent decline from the year-earlier quarter. But the sales were well above the analysts’ consensus estimate of $8.75 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. “Cisco’s performance was reasonably solid across the board,” said Jeffrey Evenson, an analyst for Bernstein Research. “The pickup in spending on networking equipment suggests companies are becoming willing to spend on longer-term projects.” That was particularly the case in the United States, where orders by large corporations had been down 20 percent on average in the previous three quarters. Under Mr. Chambers, Cisco has been a prolific buyer of companies. With the economy improving, Cisco is aggressively hunting for opportunities again. Last month, for example, Cisco made two large moves. It announced plans to purchase Starent Networks, a maker of wireless equipment, for $2.9 billion. And it bid $3 billion for Tandberg, a large Norwegian producer of videoconferencing equipment.

It's time to acknowledge that this strategy isn't working. Investors who bought Cisco's shares a decade ago have received no return on their investment. Results this week should give Cisco another chance to profess its optimism. Technology markets are rebounding. And John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, will talk about the 26 new product areas that he thinks can each generate $1 billion in sales in the near term. Eternal ebullience is nothing new from Mr. Chambers, who once claimed Cisco could increase sales by 50 percent a year over the long run. They've since grown 7 percent annually. Yet the years of deal making may be making Cisco unwieldy. Cisco has 59 standing boards and councils. This seems like a recipe for endless meetings, management confusion and reduced accountability. The company says it's a way to involve more people in decision-making. In any case, Cisco continues to acquire new businesses -- $22 billion worth since 2002 (including some $7 billion this year), according to Dealogic. Cisco has always acquired and plugged companies into its sales and production network. These firms either strengthened Cisco's core business, selling routing and switching systems, or helped increase demand for its products. There was another positive side effect of this: optimistic investors valued Cisco on earnings several years in the future. So Cisco could buy small companies at lower valuations with its supercharged stock and reap the benefit as investors then rerated the acquired earnings at Cisco's higher multiple. As the trajectories of the shares of other former acquisition machines like Tyco International and General Electric show, this strategy can stumble when companies reach a certain size. The purchaser needs more or bigger deals to show impressive growth. Cisco is indeed chasing larger ones; it recently agreed to buy Starent Networks and Tandberg for about $3 billion each. Still, Cisco may walk away from Tandberg because minority investors want more money. That suggests the company is keeping some fiscal discipline. But if Cisco follows the acquisition machine model, the difficulty in running the company smoothly while mounting ever-larger deals will become increasingly evident. Investors may become cautious, and reduce the value they attach to the acquisition machine's stock. When that happens, deals done using stock become unattractive and investors often begin clamoring for a breakup, rather than more acquisitions. The other pillar of Cisco's strategy, stock repurchases, hasn't rewarded shareholders either. Returning excess cash from operations to shareholders should increase a stock price. Unfortunately, in Cisco's case, the practice hasn't measured up to theory. Cisco has spent close to $60 billion on stock buybacks since the start of its 2002 fiscal year. That's about three-quarters of cash flow from operations. So why haven't shareholders benefited? First, the total count of shares outstanding has only decreased by 1.3 billion. This is partly because of dilutive acquisitions. However, if the number of shares hasn't shrunk much and Cisco's stock hasn't risen, this presents a conundrum. What exactly is the benefit to shareholders of these purchases? Shouldn't the price of a slice of Cisco increase if it is spending so much on buybacks? One might argue that's because Cisco's stock is undervalued. A less appealing alternative is that Cisco is in the habit of overpaying to win control of companies it covets. In this case, the benefits accrue to the seller. Part of the blame, however, lies in Cisco's generous use of options as compensation. Mr. Chambers was one of the loudest voices in Silicon Valley against forcing companies to show the cost of these grants. When Cisco spends cash to mop up the resulting shares, management gets the benefit over shareholders. After 10 years of searching for the promised land of growth, it's time for something different. Slowing acquisitions would a good start. If the strategy's benefit isn't apparent after a decade of purchases, it is hard to see how it will appear magically now. Moreover, if Cisco is so complex that it requires 59 councils, it should consider breaking into more manageable pieces. Lastly, since buybacks haven't rewarded shareholders, the company should switch to a dividend. Mr. Chambers has promised shareholders one before he retires. Adding one soon would be a great way to show that his baby has matured. For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.

This is partly because of dilutive acquisitions. However, if the number of shares hasn’t shrunk much and Cisco’s stock hasn’t risen, this presents a conundrum. What exactly is the benefit to shareholders of these purchases? Shouldn’t the price of a slice of Cisco increase if it is spending so much on buybacks? One might argue that’s because Cisco’s stock is undervalued. A less appealing alternative is that Cisco is in the habit of overpaying to win control of companies it covets. In this case, the benefits accrue to the seller. Part of the blame, however, lies in Cisco’s generous use of options as compensation. Mr. Chambers was one of the loudest voices in Silicon Valley against forcing companies to show the cost of these grants. When Cisco spends cash to mop up the resulting shares, management gets the benefit over shareholders. After 10 years of searching for the promised land of growth, it’s time for something different. Slowing acquisitions would a good start. If the strategy’s benefit isn’t apparent after a decade of purchases, it is hard to see how it will appear magically now. Moreover, if Cisco is so complex that it requires 59 councils, it should consider breaking into more manageable pieces. Lastly, since buybacks haven’t rewarded shareholders, the company should switch to a dividend. Mr. Chambers has promised shareholders one before he retires. Adding one soon would be a great way to show that his baby has matured.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Strong and steady improvement, economists say, would suggest that the United States is truly emerging from the Great Recession. Yet if tech spending fades, it would mean that recovery is further off. So far, there are many encouraging signs. The technology giants Intel, I.B.M. and Google delivered better-than-expected quarterly financial results this week, and their executives expressed confidence that the worst was over and a rebound under way. Top executives at Dell, Cisco Systems and other tech companies have also been optimistic recently. “The worst of the recession is clearly behind us and because of what we have seen, we now have the confidence to be optimistic about our future,” Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, told analysts Thursday after the company’s strong earnings report. Much depends on how the nascent revival in the technology sector plays out. Computer hardware and software are building blocks of the modern economy, as basic as iron ore and coal were to the industrial era. Together, technology products represent about half of all business spending on equipment. Microchips and clever code animate consumer technology goods, like personal computers and Apple iPhones. Larger computers in data centers power e-mail, electronic commerce and the Internet. “This will be a technology-led recovery,” said Edward Yardeni, an economist and investment strategist. “And the improvement we’re seeing from the technology companies suggests the recovery has legs.” Paul S. Otellini, chief executive of Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, pointed to his company’s solid third-quarter performance on Tuesday and said it showed that “computing is essential to people’s lives, proving the importance of technology innovation in leading an economic recovery.” Computer chips like those made by Intel are a key ingredient of technology goods, and spending on the equipment used to make semiconductors is projected to rise by 47 percent in the second half of this year, according to Gartner, a research firm. On Thursday, I.B.M., a leader in software and technology services sold to companies, reported profits and revenue that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s net income rose 14 percent from a year earlier to $3.2 billion, or $2.40 a share. I.B.M. lifted its guidance for full-year profits by 15 cents a share from its previous projection, and added that it expected year-on-year revenue to grow in the current quarter. Revenue in the third quarter fell by 5 percent, adjusted for currency movements, to $23.6 billion. “We’re seeing more stability in the economy,” Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “That’s a big improvement over the relentless declines we had been seeing.” The strongest markets for technology suppliers have been in developing nations, like China, India and Brazil. In the United States, much of the technology spending so far has been by consumers, especially buying personal computers and smartphones. But analysts caution that it is too early to tell whether the spending pickup will carry through to a key market: corporations. “We’re seeing glimmers of improvement, but it would be premature to say we’re on a strong recovery path,” said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Managers who make technology purchase decisions have yet to really open their wallets, although recent surveys of their intentions have become far more positive. Corporate buying tends to trail an economic recovery because companies routinely take several months to budget and plan technology projects. “We’re seeing corporate budgets stabilize, and with greater clarity on budgets, companies are able to plan better and move ahead on technology projects,” said Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president for research at Gartner. Tech industry executives say corporations are preparing to replace their aging personal computers  purchases that were put off during the depths of the recession. There are already some signs that companies are buying new PCs again, executives say, and that could well accelerate after the introduction of the Windows 7 operating system, a Microsoft product that will be released next week. Companies typically buy new PCs six months or so after Microsoft introduces a new operating system, after they have the chance to test the software and plan their rollout. “I think there is a very powerful refresh cycle that is coming,” Michael S. Dell, chief executive of Dell, said in a speech this week. “We are seeing the planning and early stages of this from the clients we serve, which would be about 85 percent of the organizations in the United States that have more than 500 people.” John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, was even more bullish recently, predicting a substantial increase in productivity at American companies driven by investments in Internet software and hardware. “I think we are entering a period very similar to 1997 to 2004, where you’ll see a decade run of productivity increases,” he said in an interview. Rising confidence and investment eventually translate into stepped-up hiring. That phase has just begun. Google, for example, began hiring again in August in response to a pickup in the company’s search and Internet advertising businesses, according to its chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. He said the company was also scouting for acquisitions again. “I can’t prove it,” Mr. Schmidt said, “but I would hope we’re a leading indicator.” Infosys, an Indian technology services and outsourcing company, plans to hire 1,000 workers in the United States over the next year. The move is part of its strategy to hire more locals as it expands in the American market. An improving economy would accelerate the program. “We are gaining momentum and will speed up the hiring,” said Nandita Gurjar, a senior vice president at Infosys. The steady march of digital technology, in industry after industry, is pushing the demand for information technology. The recession curbed spending for a while, and forced organizations to improve the efficiency of their data centers and technology operations. But that goes only so far. In health care, for example, rising demand is being driven by the push for computerized health records, the adoption of digital radiography, digital pathology techniques and telemedicine. “There is this huge growth in digital data coming in health care, and it is only going to add to the need for computing resources of all kinds,” said Daniel Drawbaugh, chief information officer of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a large hospital and physician group. Yet the pervasive spread of computing across industries and society, analysts say, also means the long-term growth trend in the tech sector is as much a mirror of the economy as an engine. “It is a reflection over all of how the economy is performing,” said Stephen Minton, an analyst at the research group IDC.

Skip to next paragraph Peter DaSilva for The New York Times John T. Chambers, the chairman and chief executive of Cisco, says the company plans to keep growing through acquisitions. On Tuesday, Cisco announced that it would pay $35 a share, or $2.9 billion, for Starent Networks, which makes products that help wireless telecommunications companies ship large volumes of data to phones and computing devices. The deal represents about a 20 percent premium over Starent’s closing price on Monday of $29.03 a share. After the announcement, Starent’s shares rose $4.88, or almost 17 percent, to close at $33.91 on Tuesday. For Cisco, the acquisition extends its bet that consumers and workers will keeping pulling down ever larger amounts of data onto smartphones and laptops over wireless networks. Starent’s hardware and software products make it possible to create and manage high-speed data services, and the company counts carriers like Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel, Vodafone Group and China Telecom as customers. “We have had a huge explosion in data traffic,” said Ned Hooper, Cisco’s chief strategy officer. “We expect the market for mobile data to double every year through 2013.” Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., has also forecast that by 2013, video will account for about 60 percent of the data traveling across mobile networks. The company’s recent deals reflect that optimism about the growing importance of video traffic. Two weeks ago, Cisco began a tender offer to buy Tandberg, a Norwegian maker of videoconferencing systems, for $3 billion. And in March, Cisco agreed to pay $590 million for Pure Digital Technologies, a start-up that developed the popular Flip video cameras. John T. Chambers, the chairman and chief executive of Cisco, has said that the company plans to keep spending. At $35 billion, Cisco has more cash on hand for acquisitions than any other technology company. Cisco’s vast cash stockpile results, in part, from its lucrative networking equipment business. The company is by far the largest supplier of the routers and switches that help direct data and voice traffic between computing systems. While the profit margins on many popular data center products have plummeted over the years, Cisco reports 65 percent gross profit margins on its networking hardware. Mr. Chambers has used acquisitions as a means of complementing the company’s networking products, while also getting Cisco into new businesses. For example, the purchase of Pure Digital bolsters Cisco’s video and nascent consumer electronics efforts while also giving the company a way to promote devices that create bulky files that consume great deals of bandwidth. While the Starent purchase has a video element, it is primarily a sign that Cisco expects smartphones and wireless data plans to rise in popularity. In addition, the acquisition offers another door through which Cisco can approach telecommunications companies that have turned to Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei Technologies for networking equipment that feeds mobile devices. In a research report, Mark Sue, a networking analyst with RBC Capital Markets, valued the mobile carrier infrastructure market at $47.5 billion. Starent, based in Tewksbury, Mass., was founded in 2000 and has traded publicly since 2007. Last year, the company reported a 74 percent rise in revenue, to $254.1 million. Matthew Robison, a communications analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, said Starent had made a name for itself by creating a single piece of networking hardware that could move data while also performing more complex management functions like handling user tracking and billing processes. “It’s almost like a router and a computer server in the same box,” he said. Such technology has become desirable among the large telecommunications suppliers, which have either made similar acquisitions or tried to build their own hybrid systems. “Cisco needed to do this to have a good road map out to the next generation of products,” Mr. Robison said. The all-cash deal is expected to close in the first half of 2010.

Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group reckons the leveraged buyout business should rename itself “change capital” or “value-added equity.” He has a point. Some private equity firms and funds are public themselves, and regulators may step up the public disclosures required from buyout firms. So “private equity” is no longer the best description of the industry. But other possible names may be closer to reality than the one Mr. Rubenstein suggests. “Underwater equity,” for instance. The historical record of the private equity business is pretty good. The better firms have delivered high returns for pension funds, college endowments and other investors. But with private equity’s secret sauce, high leverage, now out of the picture, the valuations of the holdings in their funds have fallen. Some companies are worth less than what is owed to creditors. Several huge buyouts, including those of Harrah’s Entertainment and Clear Channel Communications, may be in this position. That means equity investments in these companies are under water, too  and may remain so for quite some time. Or how about “fee-squared capital?” Private equity firms may make money for investors, but not before raking off plenty for themselves. Mr. Rubenstein, for instance, was recently ranked No. 123 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. Most money in private equity is made by charging annual management fees of 1.5 percent or so and then taking 20 percent of any profits. But private equity firms collect additional fees when they buy companies, while they own companies, and again when they sell companies  whether investors profit or not. Or just maybe “PUPA equity.” That stands for “private until public again.” Buyout firms like to tout the value of taking a company off the public market. It can be easier to make messy decisions  like firing staff or changing top management  when a company is out of the public eye. But to make any money, private equity firms need to sell their holdings for a profit. Sometimes that involves deciding that the public market would be best again for the company concerned. The Blackstone Group, for instance, has just told investors it plans to float a clutch of companies now that stock markets have improved. Mr. Rubenstein thinks the private equity industry is due for a name change. But maybe it just needs to go back to its roots and haul itself up by its bootstraps.

Mr. Rubenstein thinks the private equity industry is due for a name change. But maybe it just needs to go back to its roots and haul itself up by its bootstraps.

The company is simply turning many of the millions of routers it has already sold into servers. Typically, a router sits in a data center or communications closet somewhere just pushing around data packets. It's sort of like a policeman on traffic duty. Meanwhile, the servers -- the detectives, if you will -- are back in the office working on grander things. Well, Cisco has been hammering away on something it calls the Application eXtension Platform, or AXP, that it thinks can change this relationship between routers and servers. At its core, the AXP gives software developers a way to write applications that run on an additional bit of hardware that sits alongside Cisco's routers. In many cases, the applications written for the router can take on jobs typically handled by a small server sold by companies like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Dell. To drum up interest in AXP, Cisco held a contest for developers who could write the most compelling, router-friendly software. The third-place contestant, Bernard Beckmann of Germany, who won $20,000, found a way to turn VoIP phones connected to Cisco's networking gear into office surveillance systems. The speakers on the phones were essentially made to act like microphones that would try to sense unusual noises during off-peak office hours. If the phone picked up something strange, it would send an alert to security personnel. The second-place contestant, Rajesh Kotagiri of India, won $30,000 for devising a system for sending ads to electronic displays in stores. The idea is that a store already has networking equipment to support things like computers, cash registers and phones. So, why not turn one of the routers into an ad-serving dynamo that can retrieve information from advertisers, handle some limited billing operations and send the ads out to displays on a rotating basis? The first-place winner, David Perez of Spain, picked up $50,000. He concocted a way to pull data from a building's plumbing, air-conditioning and lighting systems and funnel all of it through a router. Basically, this would let maintenance people locate problems in a building and also provide a way to do things like lowering shades automatically during certain parts of the day or turning off signs to save energy.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/technology/companies/02cisco.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Cisco Buys Norwegian Firm for $3 Billion<date>Published: October 1, 2009</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO  Cisco Systems continued to show just how serious it was about videoconferencing, announcing late Wednesday night the $3 billion acquisition of Tandberg, a Norwegian video communications company. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Peter DaSilva for The New York Times John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, says the company has moved into 30 markets via acquisitions and new products. Related Times Topics: Cisco Systems Inc. Cisco sells companies expensive, room-size videoconferencing systems known as TelePresence systems. Tandberg has similar technology but also sells smaller, cheaper conferencing units. In addition, Tandberg has specialized software for managing videoconferencing systems and for creating connections between systems that rely on different underlying technology. “It really enables us to build out our portfolio,” said Ned Hooper, a senior vice president at Cisco. Cisco’s corporate videoconferencing products require the company to outfit a customer’s conference room with several large display screens, networking equipment and even special tables, chairs and wall paint. By contrast, Tandberg has a range of gear, including high-definition video systems, that can sit on desks or be used with personal computers. The all-cash tender offer has been recommended to Tandberg’s shareholders by that company’s directors and stands as an 11 percent premium over Tandberg’s closing price on Wednesday. Tandberg reported $809 million in revenue last year, and has close to $200 million in cash. In recent years, Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., has been one of the technology industry’s most aggressive companies when it comes to acquisitions. It has bought close to 40 companies in the last five years, including the $6.9 billion purchase of the set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta and the $2.9 billion purchase of the Web meeting software maker WebEx. This year, Cisco bought Pure Digital, which makes the popular Flip video camera for consumers, for $590 million. The acquisitions have suited Cisco’s mission of backing products that generate more Internet traffic, which in turn drives demand for the networking hardware that has long been the core of its business. The deals have also thrust Cisco into new markets like consumer electronics, business collaboration software and computer servers where the company now finds itself in direct competition with its traditional business partners, like Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and I.B.M. During an interview last week, Cisco’s chief executive, John T. Chambers, boasted that the company had managed to move into 30 new markets through acquisitions and its own internal product development. “We are involved in things that may shock you,” Mr. Chambers said, referring to things like smart-grid technology for municipal power systems and the construction of entertainment and networking systems for sports stadiums. With $35 billion in cash  the most among technology companies  Cisco appears set to continue with this expansion. “You will see us move with a lot of acquisitions over the next year,” Mr. Chambers said. Still, companies like Cisco, Dell and EMC must find ways to match the heft of Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M., which have huge technology services businesses to complement their hardware and software pursuits. Rather than acquiring a large services company, Cisco will continue to partner with independent players like Accenture and Wipro, Mr. Chambers said. “I think that is a more scalable, faster-speed and less confrontational model,” he said. As Cisco moves into new areas, it faces the difficult task of trying to find businesses with profits that can match those gained from its networking hardware. Cisco’s routers and switches produce 65 percent gross profit margins. Mr. Hooper stressed that Tandberg had gross margins of 66 percent. “It fits squarely into our operating model,” he said. Tandberg has had most of its success selling videoconferencing systems to large companies in North America and Europe. Cisco plans to use Tandberg’s technology to help it pursue smaller companies and eventually to sell to consumers, Mr. Hooper said. A number of companies make videoconferencing systems. Like Cisco, H.P. sells large systems aimed at companies that need sophisticated tools for their video meetings, like the ability to display graphics and movies. Microsoft and I.B.M. have focused on adding PC-based videoconferencing to their collaboration software lines, while start-ups like LifeSize have tried to undercut the larger players on price.

The most advanced broadband connections are in South Korea, Japan and Sweden, according to the study, conducted by the Saïd Business School at Oxford and the University of Oviedo in Spain, and sponsored by Cisco Systems, the telecommunications equipment maker. The work differs from some other efforts to assess how countries stack up on the basis of broadband, a form of high-speed Internet connection, because it measures the performance of these connections, rather than simply comparing market penetration rates. As broadband has become more widespread  some governments want to turn it into a universal service like electricity or water  the quality of connections has grown more important. The study takes into account the download and upload speeds of Internet connections, along with the latency, or delay, in the hookup. These measures will be increasingly important in the future, Cisco says, as consumers embrace online services like high-definition Internet television and video conferencing. The top three countries, along with six others in Europe, have sufficiently robust Internet connections to allow the average broadband customer to take advantage of these kinds of services already, according to the survey. A year ago, in an early survey by Cisco, only one country, Japan, met these criteria. Sixteen more countries, including the United States, France and Germany, fell into the second-highest category, meaning that the average Internet connection “comfortably” handles the needs of consumers for popular Web uses today, including social networking and low-definition video streaming. For the United States, that was a jump from last year, when the average Internet connection only barely met users’ needs, according to the survey. Fernando Gil de Bernabé, a senior director at Cisco, cited network upgrades by Internet providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T as a reason for the better performance. “Last year, it was quite painful for the U.S.,” he said. “This year it showed a big improvement.” But the United States still ranked behind such poorer countries as Bulgaria and Romania, the survey showed. Internet connections in Eastern Europe are often superior because network operators invested straight into the latest equipment, leapfrogging past broadband providers in other countries. Highlighting performance gaps is, for Cisco, a way to try to drive sales of networking equipment. But governments have also been paying more attention to speed and other quality issues, as broadband has climbed the political agenda in national capitals. A number of countries have recently announced or started to put into effect spending plans aimed at spreading broadband availability. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks countries on a variety of individual criteria, like average advertised download speed and how widely available broadband service is. Japan, South Korea and France are at the top of its list for speed, while the highest market penetration is in Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway, the O.E.C.D. said. The O.E.C.D. has been urging policy makers to look at issues like the divide between broadband speeds or availability in urban and rural areas, as well as discrepancies between advertised and real speeds. To try to come up with a more complete picture of where countries stand, the Cisco-sponsored researchers created an overall index of “broadband leadership” including the performance scores and market penetration. By that measure, South Korea ranked highest, followed by Japan and Hong Kong, with the United States ranking 15th. “One commonality from all the countries at the top is that they all have a national broadband agenda,” Mr. Gil de Bernabé said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Norm Betts/Bloomberg News John Chambers, chief of Cisco Systems, says the company will be making acquisitions. Add to Portfolio Abbott Laboratories Xerox Corp Cisco Systems Inc Affiliated Computer Services Incorporated Warner Chilcott Ltd Go to your Portfolio » While investors have been bidding up shares in the stock market for months, many chief executives and boards had privately remained skittish about their own businesses  until recently. In a signal that confidence  and perhaps a bit of executive swagger  may be returning to the business world, two large mergers were announced on Monday, adding to a flurry of deals in the last month. First, Abbott Laboratories, the drug maker, agreed to acquire a unit of Solvay of Belgium for $6.6 billion, and then Xerox agreed to buy Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcer, for $6.4 billion. Neither merger compares in size to the double-digit billion-dollar deals that took place just two years ago at the height of the buyout boom. But taken in the context of what has been a merger drought  in the wake of the financial crisis, deal-making is still off by more than 50 percent from last year  the transactions suggest that the most senior ranks of corporate America may now have a more optimistic outlook on the economy than some people thought. “Will you see us move with a lot of acquisitions over this next year? You betcha,” John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said in a recent meeting. “Especially if it plays out economically the way that I think.” For nearly two years, mergers plunged along with the markets as executives grappled with trying to understand how best to survive. At this time in 2007, $1.28 trillion in takeovers in the United States had been announced; so far this year, only $491.8 billion have been announced, according to Thomson Reuters. And with stock prices fluctuating sharply after falling for many months until the spring, buyers were anxious about overpaying and sellers were nervous about shortchanging themselves. But as the markets have rebounded and leveled off, companies are more confident about their prospects, so they are dipping their toes into the deal waters. The takeovers, in turn, helped lift the stock market on Monday, which had stalled recently. “The psychology has changed. This is sign that things have stabilized,” said Boon Sim, Credit Suisse’s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, who suggested that deals were a lagging indicator to the stock market. “I don’t think the floodgates are opening up,” he continued, “but C.E.O.’s are now beginning to say, ‘If I don’t buy it now, it’s only going to get more expensive in the next 12 or 18 months.’ ” What Wall Street hasn’t seen, of course, is the return of the biggest buyers in recent years  the private equity firms that propelled much of the merger mania during the debt-fueled bubble. And that may be good news. The big deals announced recently are strategic deals, in which one company buys another to make it an integral part of its business, and they do not require the buyer to take on mounds of new borrowing to pay for the acquisition. In contrast, many of the takeovers for the last five years were based on little more than financial engineering, with lax lenders providing low-interest debt to help private equity firms buy companies that they often planned to resell quickly in hopes of pocketing a fast profit. That has left many companies struggling to make interest payments, making it harder for them to invest in new products or more efficient manufacturing methods. A number of those takeovers are already underwater and some have turned sour. Just one example: Simmons, the mattress maker, was bought by the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, or THL, in 2003, largely with borrowed money. Last week, THL said that Simmons  whose immense debt burden from the takeover was hampering its prospects  would be put into bankruptcy proceedings and sold. But the sale price for Simmons is so low that bond investors will lose around $500 million. At Xerox, Ursula M. Burns, the company’s chief executive, said that she pursued the deal for Affiliated Computer Services only because she finally felt more comfortable with the performance of her own business. “We’re confident that our base business will rebound when the economy does  and in Q2 saw the right trends in this direction,” she said. “So, all factors played to our favor. At the end of the day, in tough times, strong companies look to invest in their future.” While the recent mergers may represent a positive sign for the economy, Alexander Roos, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, is less inclined to believe that we are about to see a burst of activity. In a study to be published on Tuesday, he said, his analysis of a sample of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index shows that about 20 percent are “predators,” ready to take on the risks of a deal, while another 20 percent are “prey.” “We expect a window of opportunity offering attractive takeover prospects to open soon,” Mr. Roos said. “We have already seen some of our smarter clients making preparations in recent months.” The greatest concentration of deal-making appears to be in the health care and technology sectors. Warner Chilcott made a $3.1 billion deal for Procter &amp; Gamble’s drug business last month, for example, and Dell bought Perot Systems, a technology services company, for $3.9 billion. But deals are also being made in other sectors, like food; Kraft’s $16.7 billion unsolicited bid for Cadbury, which was rejected but remains a possibility, is the largest outstanding offer to date. “If you’re healthy, it’s a great time to acquire inexpensively,” adds Ted Rouse, a head of Bain &amp; Company’s global mergers and acquisitions practice. “But it’s an awful time for two weak companies to merge.” While the return of corporate mergers may be a good sign for the economy, a bigger question may be whether it is such a good thing for companies. Most deals sound great at the time, but in the end, not all of them work out as well as planned. Mr. Rouse said, “Before the recession, Bain’s research on M.&amp;A. showed that approximately 55 percent of acquisitions failed to deliver expected shareholder returns after one year  worse than flipping a coin. The odds only get worse as the size of the acquisition increases and the target is further from the acquirer’s core business.” Let’s hope the odds are better this time around.

But now Cisco, the world’s largest maker of network technology, says business appears to have reached a “tipping point.” In the last three months, orders have started to arrive at a more consistent pace when measured against historical trends, said John T. Chambers, the chief executive, in an interview on Wednesday after the company released its fiscal fourth-quarter results. “The orders were very good,” Mr. Chambers said. “It was the first normal order rate we have seen sequentially in a year.” Such optimism seemed to run counter to Cisco’s fourth-quarter results, which showed just how much business spending on networking equipment has slowed. For the period ended July 25, Cisco reported a 46 percent plunge in net income to $1.1 billion, or 19 cents a share, from net income of $2 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding charges for stock-option compensation, acquisitions and one-time items, Cisco earned 31 cents a share, beating the forecast of 29 cents a share by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 18 percent year-over-year to $8.5 billion, meeting analysts’ expectations. Sales of Cisco’s flagship routing and switching products fell 27 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Setting those bleak sales figures aside, Mr. Chambers focused on recent sales trends to support his hopes for better results ahead. The $8.5 billion in revenue, for example, was Cisco’s first quarter-to-quarter sales increase in a year. In addition, the increase in orders from the third quarter to the fourth quarter matched past trends, leading Mr. Chambers to characterize the business as more stable. Looking ahead, Cisco expects its first-quarter revenue to come in 15 to 17 percent below the $10.3 billion it reported last year. But even with such declines, Cisco would report quarter-to-quarter growth once again. “On a global basis, we are starting to see potential positive trends in Asia-Pacific, the U.S., emerging markets and Japan,” Mr. Chambers said. He added that selling equipment in Europe remained difficult. Despite those positive signals, Mr. Chambers, known for his upbeat demeanor, cautioned that a recovery was not guaranteed. “No one knows for sure when the recovery will occur,” he said. “You would like to see a couple more quarters of the trends we saw before talking about that.” Cisco has cut more than 2,000 jobs over the last year, but on Wednesday, the company declared an end to layoffs. Analysts saw this as a crucial indicator that Mr. Chambers thought Cisco had reached bottom. “Effectively we have a new plateau, and moving forward, things appear to be behaving roughly the way they should,” said Sam Wilson, a communications analyst for JMP Securities. In the midst of the economic downturn, Cisco has charged into several new markets, including computer servers for businesses and video recorders for consumers. For the year, revenue fell 9 percent, to $36.1 billion, and profit dropped 24 percent, to $6.1 billion. Cisco finished with $35 billion in cash  one of the largest hoards in the technology industry.

Sales have been on a jagged downward slope as the technology industry dealt with its worst downturn since the dot-com bust. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Q4: Cisco's Tipping Point? But now Cisco, the world’s largest maker of network technology, says business appears to have reached a “tipping point.” In the last three months, orders have started to arrive at a more consistent pace when measured against historical trends, said John T. Chambers, the chief executive, in an interview on Wednesday after the company released its fiscal fourth-quarter results. “The orders were very good,” Mr. Chambers said. “It was the first normal order rate we have seen sequentially in a year.” Such optimism seemed to run counter to Cisco’s fourth-quarter results, which showed just how much business spending on networking equipment has slowed. For the period ended July 25, Cisco reported a 46 percent plunge in net income to $1.1 billion, or 19 cents a share, from net income of $2 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the same period last year.

What are the most important leadership lessons you’ve learned?A. People think of us as a product of our successes. I’d actually argue that we’re a product of the challenges we faced in life. And how we handled those challenges probably had more to do with what we accomplish in life. I had an issue with dyslexia before they understood what dyslexia was. One of my teachers, Mrs. Anderson, taught me to look at it like a curveball. The ball breaks the same way every time. Once you get used to it, you can handle it pretty well. So I went from almost being embarrassed reading in front of a class — you lose your place, and I read right to left — to the point where I knew I could overcome challenges. I think it also taught me sensitivity toward others. I learned another lesson from Jack Welch. It was in 1998, and at that time we were one of the most valuable companies in the world. I said, “Jack, what does it take to have a great company?” And he said, “It takes major setbacks and overcoming those.” I hesitated for a minute, and I said, “Well, we did that in ’93 and then we did it again in ’97 with the Asian financial crisis.” And he said, “No, John. I mean a near-death experience.” I didn’t understand exactly what he meant. Then, in 2001, we had a near-death experience. We went from the most valuable company in the world to a company where they questioned the leadership. And in 2003, he called me up and said, “John, you now have a great company.” I said, “Jack, it doesn’t feel like it.” But he was right. Q. How has your leadership style evolved over time? A. I’m a command-and-control person. I like being able to say turn right, and we truly have 67,000 people turn right. But that’s the style of the past. Today’s world requires a different leadership style — more collaboration and teamwork, including using Web 2.0 technologies. If you had told me I’d be video blogging and blogging, I would have said, no way. And yet our 20-somethings in the company really pushed me to use that more. Q. Did you need to be pushed? A. I thought I was very leading-edge in terms of how I communicated. My team just kept pushing, and I finally said, “Why do you want me to do this?” And they said: “John, if you don’t do it our company won’t learn how to do this. It won’t be built into our DNA for the way we interface with customers, our employees. The top has to walk the talk.” I was expecting text blogging and we did video blogging. The first one was a little bit uncomfortable, because it’s very unprofessional. You just basically put a camera there, and you go. By the second one, I realized this was going to transform communications — not just for the C.E.O., but it would change how we do business. Q. You mentioned Jack Welch. Who else do you rely on for advice? A. My wife. She has a way of picking me up when I get knocked on my tail. But also if I get a little bit overconfident, she brings me back to earth. The other day, I was practicing a concept with her and saying, “You know, there are two major mistakes that I make and Cisco makes repeatedly.” She looked at me and she said, “Only two?” My mistakes are always around moving too slow, or moving too fast without process behind it. And it’s something that, if we’re not careful, we’ll repeat again and again. Q. How do you hire? A. First thing I want to ask you about: tell me about your results. I never get hard work confused with success. So I’d walk you through the successes, and what did you do right. I’d also ask you to tell me about your failures. And that’s something people make a tremendous mistake on. First, all of us have had mistakes and failures. And it’s surprising how many people say, “Well, I can’t think of one.” That immediately loses credibility. It’s the ability to be very candid on what mistakes they’ve made, and then the question is, what would you do differently this time? Then I ask them who are the best people you recruited and developed, and where are they today? Third, I try to figure out if they’re really oriented around the customer. Are they driven by the customer, or is the customer just somebody who gets in the way? And I look at their communication skills, and one of the largest parts of communications is ... what? Q. Listening? A. You betcha. Seeing how they listen, and are they willing to challenge you? And then I look at their knowledge in industry segments, especially the area I’m interested in. Q. What’s changed in the last few years? A. Big time, the importance of collaboration. Big time, people who have teamwork skills, and their use of technology. If they’re not collaborative, if they aren’t naturally inclined toward collaboration and teamwork, if they are uncomfortable with using technology to make that happen both within Cisco and in their own life, they’re probably not going to fit in here.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/business/26mark.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Up 40%, but Still Feeling Down<date>Published: July 25, 2009</date><text>DEAR Shareholder: Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Cisco Systems Inc Go to your Portfolio » While we are not satisfied with our performance in the last quarter, we are happy to report that we didn’t lose as much money as the average stock mutual fund. That wouldn’t be a very sexy sales pitch: mutual fund managers don’t typically phrase their shareholder letters quite that bluntly. But the truth is that for most investors, it’s more important to avoid big losses than to rack up big gains. That may seem a milquetoast approach, but in the miserable market of 2008 and early 2009, minimizing losses was the best that most people could do. And because of the ugly math of investing, it has been extraordinarily difficult to recover from big declines. “People often don’t understand why they are still in a deep hole, even after they’ve had a year of great returns,” said John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the creator of the first index mutual fund. It is because when your portfolio shrinks substantially, you need an enormous gain, in percentage terms, to climb back to where you started. This is part of what Mr. Bogle (citing Justice Louis Brandeis) calls “the relentless rules of humble arithmetic.” Here’s how the math works: Suppose you lost 40 percent in 2008  roughly the decline in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. One dollar at the start of the year would have been worth 60 cents at the end. Then say that after that loss, you posted a gain of 40 percent (the rough increase in the S.&amp; P. 500 from its March low through the middle of July). That’s a spectacular return. Time to celebrate? Not really. A 40 percent gain on 60 cents is 24 cents. Your original $1 is now only 84 cents  you’re still down 16 cents. Mr. Bogle did some calculations based on the assumption that you invested $1 in the S.&amp; P. 500 at its peak. By March this year, the index had dropped 57 percent, reducing your dollar to a mere 43 cents. After a 40 percent gain, your little stash was worth only 60 cents. Even worse, he said, is the “exponential factor” in losses and recoveries. If your initial investment fell 50 percent, you would need a 100 percent gain to return to the starting line. If you lost 75 percent, you would need 300 percent. Although stocks tend to outperform bonds over the long haul, gains that big are hard to come by. And that, in a nutshell, is why it’s better to avoid big losses in the first place. Hersh Cohen, chief investment officer of ClearBridge Advisors, a Legg Mason subsidiary, says he believes in this philosophy wholeheartedly. “Make sure you don’t get killed on the downside,” he said. That’s more important, he said, than “worrying about the upside.” Mr. Cohen has managed the Legg Mason Partners Appreciation fund for 30 years, over which he has beaten the S.&amp; P. 500, according to Morningstar. The fund has returned 11.9 percent annualized, compared with 10.9 percent for the index and 10.4 percent for the average large-capitalization stock fund. (For the last 14 years, he has co-managed the fund with Scott Glasser.) Last year was “the worst in my career in 40 years of managing funds,” Mr. Cohen said. Partners Appreciation lost 29 percent, and he said he “went home depressed about it every night.” Still, that performance was much better than the overall market and a vast majority of stock mutual funds. MR. COHEN focuses on companies with “superior balance sheets” and rising dividends. At the moment, in his estimation, those include Wal-Mart, Travelers, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Cisco Systems and Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Cohen holds a doctorate in psychology  a background he calls most helpful in “market extremes.” He says he tries “to act on extremes  but to act the other way,” cutting back when the market is euphoric, and increasing his bets when others panic “and stuff is being given away.” For his part, Mr. Bogle has reduced the risk of big losses by diversifying most of his own portfolio into safer fixed-income holdings  80 percent of it  which, he said, is appropriate for his age. He is 80 and holds index funds, and while he remains bullish for the long term, he said that by being cautious he has enjoyed a “consistently good night’s sleep over the last few years.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on July 26, 2009, on page BU4 of the New York edition.DEAR Shareholder: Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Cisco Systems Inc Go to your Portfolio » While we are not satisfied with our performance in the last quarter, we are happy to report that we didn’t lose as much money as the average stock mutual fund.

Requiring parts made in the United States would be “grossly inefficient” and a “radical departure” from normal practice, said Cisco, the largest maker of networking equipment. The comments were filed with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the U.S. agency running the broadband initiative that is part of $787 billion in stimulus spending. The rules might slow projects the stimulus was meant to spur because telecommunications networks contained parts from around the globe, the two equipment makers said. Congress, seeking to create jobs in the United States, said funds provided under the program generally could not be used for iron, steel and factory goods that were not produced in the United States. “We’re talking about technologies that are no longer made in the United States,” said John Marinho, vice president of public affairs for Alcatel-Lucent, which is based in Paris. The company operates in 130 countries, and “you need a global scale,” he said. At stake was access to about $2.8 billion of the broadband funding that would go for equipment, said Jeff Evenson, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. Cisco, which is based in San Jose, California, and Alcatel are arguing their case in filings and conversations with officials at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department. President Barack Obama and Congress gave the N.T.I.A. $4.7 billion to spend on broadband and provided $2.5 billion to the Rural Utilities Service, part of the Agriculture Department. The funds are part of the program to speed the recovery of the U.S. economy. Complex procurement chains “cannot be easily re-engineered and supplanted in a matter of weeks or months,” Cisco said in its comments. “The public interest in generating jobs cannot be served if network construction on public projects is delayed” by a search for suppliers based in the United States, Cisco said. The N.T.I.A. and the Rural Utilities Service are working on the program’s rules, which are to be released “in early summer,” said Mark Tolbert, a spokesman for the N.T.I.A. He did not provide a date and declined to comment on the requests for waivers. The Telecommunications Industry Association, the trade group representing Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Intel and ADC Telecommunications, said in a letter to the Commerce Department on June 1 that thousands of components and parts are made around the globe and that requiring documentation of their origins “will severely complicate” applications for funds. Goals for the broadband spending include creating jobs, bringing high-speed Internet to more Americans, stimulating investment and connecting schools, libraries and other community centers, Mark Seifert, a senior adviser at the N.T.I.A., told Congress in testimony April 2. There is no reason to exempt companies like Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent from the “Buy American” provision, said Debbie Goldman, telecommunications policy director for the Communications Workers of America, a union based in Washington. “This is about creating American jobs — not Chinese jobs,” Ms. Goldman said. Granting a blanket exemption “in effect awards companies that have created a global supply chain that excludes the United States,” Ms. Goldman said. In a filing, she said applicants should request exemptions for each piece of equipment, subject to possible vetting by the N.T.I.A. “Show us,” Goldman said. “If you’re claiming a router isn’t made in America, show us.” Officials should approve the use of equipment from the 51 countries with U.S. trade agreements that might be considered as satisfying the “Buy American” requirements, Ms. Goldman said. The list, put out by the Office of Management and Budget, which supervises spending by U.S. government agencies, does not include China. “I would caution against anything that adversely affects the flow of trade between the United States and China,” said Mr. Marinho. “It just doesn’t make sense to exclude them from any part of the game when it comes to broadband.” Makers of broadband equipment are not the only ones saying they are feeling the pinch of the requirements. The stimulus spending includes $6 billion in municipal projects, and the wastewater industry is not sure what equipment it can use, said Dawn Kristof Champney, president of the Water and Wastewater Equipment Manufacturers Association in Washington, which represents companies like Flowserve, based in Texas, and Siemens, based in Munich. “American manufacturers are finding it difficult to comply with these new ‘Buy American’ rules because it is often impossible to avoid sourcing at least a portion of their content from other countries,” Thomas Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a letter to Mr. Obama on May 22. The rules were impeding projects for wastewater and water plants and could eliminate jobs for some steel-pipe workers, Mr. Donohue wrote. “We are a globally sourced industry,” Ms. Kristof Champney said. “It’s a very, very frustrating process, and it’s been stifling.” More Articles in Technology »WASHINGTON — Cisco Systems and Alcatel-Lucent said they wanted “Buy American” provisions waived in a $7.2 billion U.S. program to expand high-speed Internet access, saying the rules were difficult to meet and undermined the economic stimulus program.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Noah Berger for The New York Times Jonathan Kaplan, chief executive of Pure Digital, with one of the companys video cameras. Related State of the Art: HD Video Made Sleek and Simple (November 20, 2008) State of the Art: Camcorder Brings Zen to the Shoot (March 20, 2008) The tiny, eight-year-old start-up famed for its inexpensive and easy to use Flip video cameras has defeated a down economy. On Thursday, the 100-person company was bought by Cisco Systems, a technology infrastructure giant, for $590 million in stock. The deal caps off a bumpy and unpredictable rise for Pure Digital, which bested the Asian companies that dominate the camera industry from an office located above the Gump’s department store in the heart of San Francisco. “At a time when everybody has just been hammered with stories of misery, this is a really fabulous tale of what is possible against all odds,” said Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, which invested in Pure Digital. Over the last couple of years, Cisco has expanded beyond selling networking equipment for large computing centers, making inroads into the home via set-top boxes, routers and  most recently  digital stereos. The company has been clear about building upon these efforts by aiming much of its nearly $34 billion in cash at future acquisitions. In Pure Digital, Cisco found a local talent to complement its consumer ambitions and extend its business videoconferencing technology to mobile devices. Pure Digital started selling the Flip line of products in 2007 and has since shipped more than two million units, which cost $150 to $230, depending on the model. The device’s claim to fame has been its minimalism. The Flip recorders have just a few buttons, weigh a few ounces and have 1.5-inch screens. In addition, they arrive without cables, relying on a built-in connector that plugs into a computer’s U.S.B. port for both recharging and transferring video files. Along with the device, Pure Digital offers software that helps shift videos from a personal computer to online services like YouTube and Facebook with the click of a couple of buttons. The simple software, simple design and low cost opened digital camcorders to people put off by more complex devices but still hungry to pass around their videos. “They were able to capitalize on an opportunity to reach consumers that had traditionally shied away from camcorders,” said Ross Rubin, an analyst for NPD Group. Over the last few years, the sales of digital camcorders have either stayed flat or declined, according to Mr. Rubin. Meanwhile, Pure Digital tripled its sales of the Flip products over the last year and now holds close to one-fifth of the market. Sony, the market leader, has since mimicked Pure Digital’s products, as have a host of smaller competitors. The no-nonsense Flip design set Pure Digital’s path on a new trajectory. “We became a profitable business from the day we launched Flip,” said Jonathan Kaplan, the company’s chief. The company started off selling single-use digital still cameras at drugstores. Customers would rent the cameras and bring them to make prints. The business worked, at first. But as nondisposable cameras became increasingly affordable, Pure Digital’s sales tumbled. “The market demand for that product just melted away,” Mr. Moritz said. “We found ourselves selling disposable cameras into a market that was shrinking by the hour.” The company next moved to single-use digital camcorders, also distributed through drugstores, where the videos could be burned onto DVDs. Despite trying various approaches, Pure Digital remained in search of a big hit. Luckily, the company’s partners  and, somewhat surprisingly, computer hackers  helped to nudge it in the right direction. For example, hackers were removing the memory chips from the single-use recorders so they could put videos onto their PCs. In addition, the drugstores asked Pure Digital to limit the accessories it shipped with its cameras, a demand that gave rise to the built-in U.S.B. connector. With such prodding, Pure Digital’s staff hit upon the idea of a cheap, easy-to-use digital camera that could funnel videos between the device, PCs and Web sites. Ever since, the company maintained its simple approach while working to make products more attractive via colorful designs and better-quality video. Cisco’s deep pockets could help Flip, financed by close to $70 million, succeed outside of the United States and Britain, according to Mr. Moritz. “You have to scale up your inventory to satisfy demand in lots of different countries, and that is a very expensive proposition,” he said. Such a consumer play is still a curious one for Cisco. The company tends to operate in the background, providing products that companies use to link phones and computers to the Internet. But Cisco has also made large investments in videoconferencing. The more the Flip encourages consumers to videoconference, the more money the company looks to make selling the routers and switches needed to process the large video files flying off Flip devices and onto YouTube. Less than 5 percent of Cisco’s $40 billion in annual sales comes from consumer products, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Cisco is already familiar with Pure Digital’s product. The family of John T. Chambers, the chief executive at Cisco, owns eight of the Flip devices, and executives at the company often post their own videos to an internal version of YouTube. In the future, it is expected that Cisco will release versions of the Flip recorders that can connect to wireless networks. There are other surprises in store as well, said Mr. Kaplan. “The Flip will find its way into some very obvious places and maybe some not-so-obvious ones,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Noah Berger for The New York Times Jonathan Kaplan, chief executive of Pure Digital, with one of the companys video cameras. Related State of the Art: HD Video Made Sleek and Simple (November 20, 2008) State of the Art: Camcorder Brings Zen to the Shoot (March 20, 2008) The tiny, eight-year-old start-up famed for its inexpensive and easy to use Flip video cameras has defeated a down economy. On Thursday, the 100-person company was bought by Cisco Systems, a technology infrastructure giant, for $590 million in stock. The deal caps off a bumpy and unpredictable rise for Pure Digital, which bested the Asian companies that dominate the camera industry from an office located above the Gump’s department store in the heart of San Francisco. “At a time when everybody has just been hammered with stories of misery, this is a really fabulous tale of what is possible against all odds,” said Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, which invested in Pure Digital. Over the last couple of years, Cisco has expanded beyond selling networking equipment for large computing centers, making inroads into the home via set-top boxes, routers and  most recently  digital stereos. The company has been clear about building upon these efforts by aiming much of its nearly $34 billion in cash at future acquisitions. In Pure Digital, Cisco found a local talent to complement its consumer ambitions and extend its business videoconferencing technology to mobile devices. Pure Digital started selling the Flip line of products in 2007 and has since shipped more than two million units, which cost $150 to $230, depending on the model. The device’s claim to fame has been its minimalism. The Flip recorders have just a few buttons, weigh a few ounces and have 1.5-inch screens. In addition, they arrive without cables, relying on a built-in connector that plugs into a computer’s U.S.B. port for both recharging and transferring video files. Along with the device, Pure Digital offers software that helps shift videos from a personal computer to online services like YouTube and Facebook with the click of a couple of buttons. The simple software, simple design and low cost opened digital camcorders to people put off by more complex devices but still hungry to pass around their videos. “They were able to capitalize on an opportunity to reach consumers that had traditionally shied away from camcorders,” said Ross Rubin, an analyst for NPD Group. Over the last few years, the sales of digital camcorders have either stayed flat or declined, according to Mr. Rubin. Meanwhile, Pure Digital tripled its sales of the Flip products over the last year and now holds close to one-fifth of the market. Sony, the market leader, has since mimicked Pure Digital’s products, as have a host of smaller competitors. The no-nonsense Flip design set Pure Digital’s path on a new trajectory. “We became a profitable business from the day we launched Flip,” said Jonathan Kaplan, the company’s chief. The company started off selling single-use digital still cameras at drugstores. Customers would rent the cameras and bring them to make prints. The business worked, at first. But as nondisposable cameras became increasingly affordable, Pure Digital’s sales tumbled. “The market demand for that product just melted away,” Mr. Moritz said. “We found ourselves selling disposable cameras into a market that was shrinking by the hour.” The company next moved to single-use digital camcorders, also distributed through drugstores, where the videos could be burned onto DVDs. Despite trying various approaches, Pure Digital remained in search of a big hit. Luckily, the company’s partners  and, somewhat surprisingly, computer hackers  helped to nudge it in the right direction. For example, hackers were removing the memory chips from the single-use recorders so they could put videos onto their PCs.

Chambers, the chief executive, is issuing one of the more optimistic forecasts from Silicon Valley  that the United States economy will recover this year. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Cisco Systems Inc. According to Mr. Chambers, most of Cisco’s customers expect the economic downturn to linger well into 2010, while a smaller number expect the downturn to ease late this year. In an interview after announcing the company’s second-quarter results Wednesday, Mr. Chambers said be believed things might get worse before they get better, but agreed with customers who foresaw better times sometime this year. “The reason I am more optimistic than others is because you have $1.6 trillion coming in from governments around the world, with the U.S. accounting for about half of that,” Mr. Chambers said. Like many major high-tech companies, Cisco, the largest maker of networking equipment, faces declining corporate spending. Growth in orders fell 9 percent in November, 11 percent in December and 20 percent in January. These declines prompted Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., to forecast Wednesday that revenue for the current quarter will plummet as much as 20 percent compared with the $9.8 billion reported in the same period last year. Cisco’s bleak assessment of corporate spending on technology could prove especially worrisome for investors. The company’s second quarter closed on Jan. 24, giving Wall Street the most up-to-date glimpse into customers’ spending patterns of any major technology company. In addition, only 20 percent of Cisco’s sales come from regularly repeating deals, so Cisco must fight for 80 percent of its sales every quarter. This gives it better insight into current fluctuations in customer demand than many companies have. Mr. Chambers’s optimism stems from the large amounts of government spending both here and abroad on infrastructure projects, including things like better broadband technology, health care and education, that should drive equipment sales. Mr. Chambers credited governments in the United States and abroad with relatively efficient action in enacting new infrastructure programs. “The central banks around the world are working very aggressively to get that money into the marketplace,” he said. During the conference call, Mr. Chambers, who says he is a Republican, also complimented the new president. “President Obama is off to a great start,” said Mr. Chambers. “I think his economic team is world class.” Cisco plans to increase its investment in sales programs aimed at customers in America, China and India, viewing those countries as the first to increase their spending. It will then mount a second sales effort in Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia, expecting business in those regions to pick up next. Despite such optimism, Cisco must deal with some harsh immediate realities. The company’s second-quarter net income tumbled 27 percent to $1.5 billion, or 32 cents a share, which compares with net income of $2.1 billion, or 38 cents a share, reported in the same period last year. Cisco beat the consensus forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters of 30 cents. Revenue in the second quarter fell to $9.1 billion, or a drop of 7.5 percent from the $9.8 billion recorded a year earlier. Seeking to save about $1 billion in costs this year, Cisco is considering laying off 1,500 to 2,000 of its 67,300 workers. Mr. Chambers hesitated to characterize this as a “broad-scale layoff,” which he defined as cutting at least 10 percent of a company’s work force. However, he added, larger layoffs remained a possibility if conditions worsened. During the second quarter, Cisco amassed $3.2 billion in cash  one of the highest amounts in company history  leaving it with $29.5 billion. The majority of that cash remains overseas. Cisco could use its cash hoard to continue acquiring companies, placing an immediate emphasis on bolstering its consumer electronics business.

Related Times Topics: Cisco Systems Inc. The product  a server computer equipped with sophisticated virtualization software  is a bold but risky move by Cisco into an unfamiliar, intensely competitive market that typically produces far lower profits than Cisco makes from network gear. But it reflects the company’s ambition to grow beyond its roots as the so-called plumber of the Internet to offer everything from instant messaging software to digital stereos. For years, Cisco remained content to sell the switches and routers that direct the rivers of data flowing between computing systems. It dominates that market, making most of its $40 billion a year in revenue, and 65 percent gross profit margins, from such products. The other major makers of computer hardware, including H.P., I.B.M. and Dell, have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the company, which is based in San Jose, Calif.: Cisco sells networking gear, while they sell personal computers, servers, storage systems and software. Industry experts say that Cisco’s push into the server market will disrupt that comfortable symbiosis and could cause an all-out war among the tech titans for one another’s customers. “This will be the most important and most talked-about product of the year,” said Brent Bracelin, a hardware analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. “There will be massive competitive reactions from both I.B.M. and H.P., and we expect this will lead to a new wave of industry consolidation.” Cisco executives played down the potential for serious conflict. “We see this not as a new market, but a market transition,” said Padmasree Warrior, the company’s chief technology officer. “Any time there is a major transition occurring, there will be large companies that have to compete in some areas.” The technology driver behind this transition, according to Cisco, is virtualization software. Over the last decade, virtualization software has experienced a meteoric rise. Virtualization products let companies run numerous business applications, rather than just one, on each physical server, allowing them to save electricity and get more out of their hardware purchases. Recently, however, virtualization technology has started to have a more significant impact on business computing systems as a whole. New tools developed by VMware, the market leader, make it possible to shuffle business applications around a data center just by pointing a computer mouse at an icon on the screen. The mobility of the software has broken some of the traditional, linear connections among computers, storage systems and networking hardware. As a result, companies like Cisco see an opportunity to produce a new, potentially disruptive class of hardware and software management systems that span an entire data center. With customers looking to manage their data centers as a single entity rather than separate units, the world’s largest technology companies must now fight to secure the most prominent, central position possible. Cisco’s newfound aspirations stretch well beyond the $50 billion server market to include management software and possibly even storage. “Our vision is, how do we virtualize the entire data center?” Ms. Warrior said. “It is not about a single product. We will have a series of products that enable us to make that transition.” Cisco could show off the first of its new systems as early as March. The company would not disclose the exact nature of the product, although people with knowledge of Cisco’s plans said it would sell a server bundled with networking hardware and virtualization software from both Cisco and VMware. Rather than working as a general purpose system, the Cisco product will cater just to virtual applications. (Cisco owns close to 2 percent of VMware, a public company that is majority-owned by EMC, a maker of computer storage systems.) Cisco’s diversification into the server market is fraught with risk. Cisco boasts gross profit margins of close to 65 percent, while companies selling basic servers tend toward gross margins closer to 25 percent on those products. Ms. Warrior maintained that by bundling various hardware components with software, Cisco would earn higher profits than are typical for servers. But Wall Street remains skeptical. “It will certainly be a challenge for Cisco to get the new products to the same margin levels as its current products,” an analyst with Signal Hill, Erik Suppiger, said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on January 20, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.SAN JOSE, Calif.  Within the next few months, Cisco Systems, the largest maker of networking equipment, plans to release a product that threatens to shake up the technology industry and put the company on a collision course with traditional partners like Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M.

Skip to next paragraph New Technology Blog Gadgetwise News, analysis and opinion on new gadgets, plus tips on getting the most out of the technology you already have. Cisco Systems, the dominant provider of the digital pipes that run the Internet, is making a big play in digital entertainment. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January in Las Vegas, it plans to introduce a new line of products, including a digital stereo system that is meant to move music wirelessly around a house. That is the first small move in a long-term strategy to take on Apple, Sony and the other giants of consumer electronics. Cisco is working on other gadgets that will let people watch Internet video on their televisions more easily. And its biggest bet is that people will want to use a version of its corporate videoconferencing system called Telepresence to chat with their friends over their high-definition televisions. The company has been talking about reaching out to consumers for years. At the same show two years ago, John T. Chambers, the company’s chief executive, laid out a strategy for building networks for entertainment in the home. At the show last year, it promised new technology that would help media companies publish more video that could be watched on these home networks. But after delays, changes in plans and the assignment of a new executive to oversee all this, Cisco now says the first of its products will hit the shelves, and the video sites will be on the Web, in January. While Cisco is a newcomer to the consumer electronics business, the company says that after years of promises by the industry, consumer electronics is only now taking advantage of broadband Internet connections and home networks. “This holiday the vast majority of consumer electronics purchases will be connected,” said Ned Hooper, a Cisco senior vice president, in an interview before Christmas. Mr. Hooper was put in charge of the consumer electronics push a year ago. Many music players, digital cameras, game consoles, Blu-ray players and a variety of set-top boxes connect to the Internet directly or by way of a computer. Although they are digital, most of the high-definition televisions sold so far do not have Internet connections. But Mr. Hooper argues that televisions soon will also be connected to home networks and the Internet. “We are all making this investment in high-definition television, but all we are doing with them is watching TV the same way,” Mr. Hooper said. “They can actually provide all sorts of experiences, whether it is viewing family photos or connecting to the Internet to watch video.” Cisco can draw on much of its existing business line to help build its home electronics products. It is the leading maker of routers and switches, the devices that act as the traffic lights of the Internet in connecting one computer to another. In 2005, it bought Scientific Atlanta, one of the leading makers of equipment for cable TV systems. And Linksys, which it bought in 2003, is the top seller of devices used to set up wireless and wired networks in homes and small businesses. Sales directly to consumers represented only 2 percent of Cisco’s $40 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year. But the company is counting on home entertainment, along with Scientific Atlanta and some other new initiatives the company calls “advanced technology,” to provide much of its growth. Despite Cisco’s dominance of the corporate market and its $27 billion in cash, it faces a number of challenges as it tries to find a place in the home. The Cisco brand is not associated with consumer electronics. The company runs fast-paced commercials with the slogan, “Welcome to the human network,” but it is not particularly clear what Cisco is offering to consumers. “I don’t think that when they hear the name Cisco they think of great products in consumer electronics,” said John MacFarlane, the chief executive of Sonos, which already makes systems that send music around the house wirelessly. With the exception of Apple, other computer companies have not had much success in consumer electronics. Dell and Gateway have been in and out of the television and music player business. Hewlett-Packard is still trying to sell computers, servers and set-top boxes designed to move video around the home, but it, too, has dropped out of the television business. Intel, the computer chip maker, abandoned its Viiv brand of processors for media center computers after consumers gave the cold shoulder to the devices, which had been promoted as the key to moving content around their houses. Mr. Hooper says Cisco has no interest in selling televisions. It will continue to make set-top boxes that bring in programs from cable and the Internet, but it assumes that eventually all televisions will simply connect directly to home networks. Consumers, however, have not been all that interested in set-top boxes, despite many offerings from companies including TiVo, Vudu and Roku. The most successful has been the Apple TV, which can be used to watch downloaded movies and television programs, but it is still what Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, called a “hobby” rather than a business like the iPod or the iPhone. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on December 29, 2008, on page B3 of the New York edition.Your plumber would like to take you dancing.

The most successful has been the Apple TV, which can be used to watch downloaded movies and television programs, but it is still what Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, called a “hobby” rather than a business like the iPod or the iPhone. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/technology/15tech.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Tech Companies, Long Insulated, Now Feel Slump<date>Correction: November 20, 2008Published: November 14, 2008</date><text>The technology industry, which resisted the economy’s growing weakness over the last year as customers kept buying laptops and iPhones, has finally succumbed to the slowdown. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Feature 10 Weeks of Financial Turmoil Related Times Topics: Credit Crisis  The Essentials In the span of just a few weeks, orders for both business and consumer tech products have collapsed, and technology companies have begun laying off workers. The plunge is so severe that some executives are comparing it with the dot-com bust in 2000, when hundreds of companies disappeared and Silicon Valley lost nearly a fifth of its jobs. October “was like turning a switch,” said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the Investment Technology Group, a research and trading firm. “Everything pretty much shut down.” After industry leaders like Intel and Nokia warned of slowing sales this week, investors aggressively sold technology stocks. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite index, which is full of technology names, fell 5 percent. Advanced Micro Devices and eBay both dropped more than 10 percent. Tech companies directly account for about 4 percent of the nation’s employment. And globally, companies and governments spend about $1.75 trillion on technology a year, according to Forrester Research. But the industry’s importance to the world economy is larger than its size might suggest. Technology has fueled many of the productivity gains of the last two decades. And about half of the capital spending by corporations goes toward technology products, according to Moody’s Economy.com. As struggling businesses cut back on spending of all kinds, a slowdown in tech proved inevitable. During the dot-com crash, technology companies were victims of Internet hype that they helped create. Once the enthusiasm faded, so did the boom-era sales on software and infrastructure equipment. However, consumer enthusiasm for products like video games, wireless phones and high-definition televisions helped the industry recover. This time around, the tech sector finds itself at the mercy of a double-barreled slump in both corporate and consumer spending caused by the housing decline and the economic crisis on Wall Street. Technology companies are also feeling the effect of frozen credit markets as business and government customers struggle to finance computer and software purchases that can run to millions of dollars. “We have never seen anything like this in history,” said William T. Coleman III, a Silicon Valley veteran who founded the software maker BEA Systems and is now chief executive at a start-up called Cassatt. Best Buy, the leading electronics retailer, declared this week that “rapid, seismic changes in consumer behavior” had fostered the worst conditions in its 42-year history, and its main rival, Circuit City Stores, filed for bankruptcy protection. Nokia, the world’s largest maker of cellphones, predicted Friday that global sales of handsets would fall in 2009, which would be only the second decline ever. Technology giants like Intel, which makes chips for personal computers and servers, and Cisco Systems, which makes network equipment, warned that revenue was plummeting at rates last seen in 2001. Dozens of start-ups, like the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, have been cutting staff members as they prepare for a slow economy. And on Friday, Sun Microsystems, a leading maker of computers used by financial services companies, announced that it would lay off as many as 6,000 employees, or 18 percent of its work force. The turnaround has been as sudden as it is severe. Until late September, a number of large technology companies maintained an optimistic stance, despite the obvious distress in the global economy. Cisco was the first large technology company to reveal its sales data from October, noting a 9 percent fall in sales compared with the same month last year. On Nov. 5, Cisco, which is based in San Jose, cautioned that because of a “completely different environment,” revenue in its current quarter could plummet as much as 10 percent  a major reversal from the 7 percent growth that Wall Street had been expecting. Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, followed this week, warning that sales in the fourth quarter could fall as much as 19 percent compared with the same period last year. Even Google, an advertising juggernaut that many analysts said they believed would weather a downturn better than other companies, is now feeling the impact. About eight weeks ago, the company’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, told reporters, “My guess is that the drama is in New York and not here.” A month later, Google surprised Wall Street when it reported strong financial results for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, sending its shares up 10 percent. But Google’s stock has dropped 16 percent since, as the same analysts who were upbeat about its results have since cut their revenue and profit forecasts. This week, its shares dipped below $300 for the first time in three years, well below their $742 peak. And the company, known for its torrid hiring and free-spending on employee perks, has begun the most serious belt-tightening in its 10-year history. “We don’t know as managers how long the crisis goes,” Mr. Schmidt said last week. For all the gloom, the tech industry is still far healthier than Wall Street. Unlike the banks, many technology companies are flush with cash. Cisco has close to $27 billion; Google, $14 billion; and Apple, $24 billion. It is likely that some of these funds will go toward acquiring struggling competitors. “The guys that aren’t as strong will be good pickings,” Mr. Coleman said. Powered by technology, Silicon Valley has stood out as a bright spot for jobs in the United States, with employment growing at about 2 percent a year while national employment slowed. Through 2007, the region continued to add 20,000 jobs, although that positive trend has started to change. “With this now having become a worldwide event, it’s clear that the job losses will come,” said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. Given the unpredictability of the current economy, the industry’s past experience will only go so far, said Chris Cornell, an economist with Economy.com. “It would be a tragic mistake for C.E.O.’s who did a great job fighting the last recession to think the same tactics will work this time,” he said.

Yee/The New York Times Cisco has wired the new Yankee Stadium with the latest video, Internet and voice technology. Enlarge This Image Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times Yankee Studium has been wired with monitors that will offer weather and traffic updates, to enhance the fan experience. None of that will be supplied by the free agent C. C. Sabathia, but by Cisco Systems, the high-tech behemoth, which has wired the new $1.3 billion Yankee Stadium with what it said was the most advanced technology ever embedded in a North American stadium. “Yankee Stadium will be in a constant state of the artness,” Lonn Trost, the team’s chief operating officer, told a news conference at Cisco’s office across West 33rd Street from Madison Square Garden. “Don’t look up that word. It doesn’t exist.” John T. Chambers, the passionate salesman who is the chairman of Cisco, offered a cinematic analysis of the company’s installation at the new stadium, which he estimated cost $15 million to $16 million and is not part of a sponsorship. “Take the dream of ‘Star Trek’ or other movies,” he said in a voice suffused with the influence of his upbringing in West Virginia. “That concept is where we’re going to go.” He added: “It’s going to change all of sports. I don’t think I’m too bold in saying that.” The technological prowess acquired by the Yankees includes the ability to program 1,100 flat-panel, high-definition TV monitors with live game coverage, archival and highlight video, statistics, promotional messages and weather and traffic updates. The monitors will be located at concession stands, inside the 59 luxury and party suites, around the restaurants and bars, and in restrooms. They are designed to surround fans visually from the moment they walk into the stadium, especially when they stray from a direct view of the field. The team will be its own video puppeteer, controlling all the monitors centrally with the capabilities of offering different content on each one. Each player will have a computer at his locker and all video instruction has been integrated into the Cisco system. The luxury suites will be outfitted with special touch-screen phones that will let better-heeled fans order food and merchandise. And Cisco’s video-conferencing technology will be installed in the stadium’s business conference center, which will let it connect to a library in the Bronx (for students and community groups) and eventually to other locations in the city like hospitals, to let players and executives talk to fans. “The ultimate fan experience is when Derek Jeter can help some kid in the Bronx learn long division” via video conferencing, said Ron Ricci, the co-chairman of Cisco’s sports and entertainment division , who said he learned arithmetic through baseball. Ricci and Chambers said that the technology already wired into the stadium would eventually allow fans at the stadium, and at home and beyond, to connect the system’s data and video to their home televisions and mobile devices. “This technology is future proof,” Ricci said. “It will be possible, at the next level, that fans at each seat will have an individualized interactive experience, perhaps ordering food and picking it up at the concession stands, most assuredly through your mobile phone.” He added: “I can’t emphasize enough how important video is. It’s the killer application. It’s what fans want to see, to see more angles and do it on their terms.” Some elements of the system, which Cisco began installing about two years ago as the stadium was being built, will take a while to be fully functional. Trost said his greatest concern was making sure the stadium opened on time, but insisted that elevating the fan experience  a phrase used repeatedly  was behind the Cisco strategy. “We can’t deliver the same thing every year,” Trost said. “We try to deliver winning ballclubs and part of that is bringing in winning partners.” Chambers said that past experience told him he could not be certain how the technology would evolve or how envisioned uses would change over time. “Once you build the architecture,” he said, “it’s like highways. You can really go wherever you want.” The Yankees have created a technology subsidiary, which seems appropriate. Trost said his high-tech learning curve ended in the 1960s with his mastery of the mimeograph machine. And Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ co-chairman, said of some of Cisco’s technology: “I didn’t know it existed.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on November 12, 2008, on page B13 of the New York edition.The Yankees, still looking for pitching help, detoured on Tuesday into discussions of wireless technology, the convergence of video, Internet and voice, and killer apps.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Cisco Systems Inc. The computer networking giant, the first major technology company to report financial results that include October, when the credit crisis spread beyond financial companies, said Wednesday that its sales fell by 9 percent in the month, compared to a year earlier. Cisco expects sales for its current quarter to drop 5 to 10 percent from the $9.8 billion reported in the same period last year. “The environment has changed dramatically in the last two months,” John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, said in a conference with Wall Street analysts. At times, Mr. Chambers sounded flummoxed by the state of the economy and growing pessimism among customers. “I think we are in a little bit of uncharted waters,” he said, adding that “it is probably the second most difficult time in my career” to provide a comfortable forecast about where things are heading. Revenue dropped 15 percent in its fiscal 2002, compared with 2001 when technology spending on the Internet collapsed. The company’s executives stressed that Cisco’s experience with the boom-bust nature of technology have it well positioned to emerge from the downturn unscathed. More than 60 percent of Cisco’s top executives were around during the dot-com bust. “We have been through this four or five times,” Mr. Chambers said. “Each time we have done this we have come out in very strong financial shape.” During its first quarter ended Oct. 25, the company, based in San Jose, Calif., reported net income of $2.2 billion, or 37 cents a share, flat against year-ago net income of $2.21 billion, or 35 cents a share. Excluding charges, Cisco earned 42 cents a share, beating the 39 cents a share Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted. Cisco’s first-quarter sales rose 8 percent, to $10.3 billion, from $9.55 billion. The company has now joined fellow technology giants Intel, Microsoft and Dell in issuing apprehensive forecasts of technology sales in 2009. “There was a completely different environment as we got into October,” Cisco’s chief financial officer, Frank Calderoni, said in an interview. Cisco had been expected to increase second-quarter revenue by about 7 percent, so the revelation that Cisco expected second-quarter revenue to decline, possibly by double digits, arrived as a shock. “I would say that is dramatically lower than what we were thinking,” said Simona Jankowski, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. “We’re getting the first look at what’s going on in October, and it’s pretty scary.” Cisco has started to cut costs as it looks to weather current conditions, pulling back on hiring, contractors, travel, marketing and recruiting. In total, Cisco hopes to carve out $1 billion in expenses during its current fiscal year. “There is no major round of layoffs coming, but they are going to really slash costs wherever they can,” said Mark Sue, a networking analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Cisco continues to maintain a long-term growth goal of 12 to 17 percent. While blaming economic weakness in the United States for the falling sales, Mr. Chambers expressed some optimism. “In our opinion, the U.S. will be the first major country to recover,” he said. Shares of Cisco closed down 5.13 percent, at $17.39, in Wednesday’s regular trading. In after-hours trading, they dropped another 6 percent to $16.35, after the release of the first-quarter report.

While blockbusters do emerge, few of the new products or processes that evolve from innovative thinking ultimately survive the test of time. During periods of economic growth, such inefficiencies are chalked up as part of the price of forging into the future. But these aren’t such times. Wild market gyrations, frozen credit markets and an overall sour economy herald a new round of corporate belt-tightening. Foremost on the target list is anything inefficient. That’s bad news for corporate innovation, and it could spell trouble for years to come, even after the economy turns around. “To be honest, we had a problem with innovation even before the economic crisis. That’s the reason I wrote my book,” says Judy Estrin, former chief technology officer at Cisco Systems and author of “Closing the Innovation Gap.” “We’re focusing on the short term and we’re not planting the seeds for the future.” In tough times, of course, many companies have to scale back. But, she says: “To quote Obama, you don’t use a hatchet. You use a scalpel. Leaders need to pick and choose with great care.” There are important things managers can do to ensure that creative forward-thinking doesn’t go out the door with each round of layoffs. Fostering a companywide atmosphere of innovation  encouraging everyone to take risks and to think about novel solutions, from receptionists to corner-suite executives  helps ensure that the loss of any particular set of minds needn’t spell trouble for the entire company. She suggests instilling five core values to entrench innovation in the corporate mind-set: questioning, risk-taking, openness, patience and trust. All five must be used together  risk-taking without questioning leads to recklessness, she says, while patience without trust sets up an every-man-for-himself mentality. In an era of Six Sigma black belts and brown belts, Ms. Estrin urges setting aside certain efficiency measures in favor of what she calls “green-thumb leadership”  a future-oriented management style that understands, and even encourages, taking risks. Let efficiency measures govern the existing “factory farm,” she says, but create greenhouses and experimental gardens along the sides of the farm to nurture the risky investments that likely will take a number of years to bear fruit. “I’m not suggesting you only cut from today’s stuff and keep the future part untouched,” she says. “You have to balance it.” Yet even that approach has its drawbacks. Companies that create silos of innovation by designating one group as the “big thinkers” while making others handle day-to-day concerns risk losing their innovative edge if any of the big thinkers leave the company or ultimately must be laid off. “Innovation has to be embedded in the daily operation, in the entire work force,” says Jon Fisher, a business professor, serial entrepreneur, and author of “Strategic Entrepreneurism,” which advocates building a start-up’s business from the beginning with an eye toward selling the company. “A large acquirer’s interest in a start-up or smaller company is binary in nature: They either want you or they don’t, based on the innovation you have to offer. The best way to foster innovation is to create something, put it to the test, build a good company and then get it under the umbrella of a world-renowned company to move it forward.” David Thompson, chief executive and co-founder of Genius.com Inc., based in San Mateo, Calif., says that innovation “has a bad name in down times” but that “bad times focus the mind and the best-focused minds in the down times are looking for the opportunities.” “You do have to batten down the hatches and reduce expenses, but you can’t do it at the expense of the big picture,” Mr. Thompson adds. “You always have to keep in mind the bigger picture that’s coming down the road in two or three years. “The last thing you want to do with innovation is just throw money at it. It’s a very tricky balance.” In fact, hard times can be the source of innovative inspiration, says Chris Shipley, a technology analyst and executive producer of the DEMO conferences, where new ideas make their debuts. “Some of the best products and services come out of some of the worst times,” she says. In the early 1990s, tens of millions of dollars had gone down the drain in a futile effort to develop “pen computing”  an early phase of mobile computing  and a recession was shriveling the economic outlook. Yet the tiny Palm Computing managed to revitalize the entire industry in a matter of months by transforming itself overnight from a software maker into a hardware company. “Our biggest challenge right now is fear,” she says. “The worst thing that a company can do right now is go into hibernation, into duck-and-cover. If you just sit on your backside and wait for things to get better, they’re not going to. They’re going to get better for somebody, but not necessarily for you.” HOWARD LIEBERMAN, also a serial entrepreneur and founder of the Silicon Valley Innovation Institute, says innovation breeds effectiveness. It’s not about efficiency, he argues. “Efficiency is for bean counters,” he says. “It’s not for C.E.O.’s or inventors or founders.” The current economic downturn comes as no surprise to him, he says, because it mirrors the downturn at the time of the dot-com bust. Then and now, the companies that survive are those that keep creativity and innovation foremost. “Creativity doesn’t care about economic downturns,” Mr. Lieberman says. “In the middle of the 1970s, when we were having a big economic downturn, both Apple and Microsoft were founded. Creative people don’t care about the time or the season or the state of the economy; they just go out and do their thing.” Janet Rae-Dupree writes about science and emerging technology in Silicon Valley.

While blockbusters do emerge, few of the new products or processes that evolve from innovative thinking ultimately survive the test of time. During periods of economic growth, such inefficiencies are chalked up as part of the price of forging into the future. But these aren’t such times. Wild market gyrations, frozen credit markets and an overall sour economy herald a new round of corporate belt-tightening. Foremost on the target list is anything inefficient. That’s bad news for corporate innovation, and it could spell trouble for years to come, even after the economy turns around. “To be honest, we had a problem with innovation even before the economic crisis. That’s the reason I wrote my book,” says Judy Estrin, former chief technology officer at Cisco Systems and author of “Closing the Innovation Gap.” “We’re focusing on the short term and we’re not planting the seeds for the future.” In tough times, of course, many companies have to scale back. But, she says: “To quote Obama, you don’t use a hatchet. You use a scalpel. Leaders need to pick and choose with great care.” There are important things managers can do to ensure that creative forward-thinking doesn’t go out the door with each round of layoffs. Fostering a companywide atmosphere of innovation  encouraging everyone to take risks and to think about novel solutions, from receptionists to corner-suite executives  helps ensure that the loss of any particular set of minds needn’t spell trouble for the entire company. She suggests instilling five core values to entrench innovation in the corporate mind-set: questioning, risk-taking, openness, patience and trust. All five must be used together  risk-taking without questioning leads to recklessness, she says, while patience without trust sets up an every-man-for-himself mentality. In an era of Six Sigma black belts and brown belts, Ms. Estrin urges setting aside certain efficiency measures in favor of what she calls “green-thumb leadership”  a future-oriented management style that understands, and even encourages, taking risks. Let efficiency measures govern the existing “factory farm,” she says, but create greenhouses and experimental gardens along the sides of the farm to nurture the risky investments that likely will take a number of years to bear fruit. “I’m not suggesting you only cut from today’s stuff and keep the future part untouched,” she says. “You have to balance it.” Yet even that approach has its drawbacks.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Sun Microsystems Inc. Jayshree Ullal was recruited to be Aristas chief executive. Mr. Bechtolsheim’s new company, Arista Networks, has built an ultra-fast network switch that costs one-tenth the price of similar products from Cisco. The hardware, which has already been purchased in small quantities by government labs, universities and Internet start-ups, is aimed squarely at data-oriented organizations like Google that need to wring as much speed as possible from their computing centers. While a number of companies sell competing gear, the pedigree of Arista’s management and its modular, easy-to-update software have given the four-year-old firm instant credibility in Silicon Valley. Mr. Bechtolsheim, who will serve as chairman and chief development officer of Arista, co-founded Sun and invented its first product, a high-powered desktop computer known as a workstation. He went on to start two other companies before returning to Sun four years ago and overhauling its product line. Arista  known as Arastra until it changed its name this week  is expected to announce on Thursday that it has recruited Jayshree Ullal as chief executive. Ms. Ullal left Cisco in May after leading the company’s $10 billion corporate switch business. In addition, the company will name a Stanford University professor, David R. Cheriton, as its chief scientist. Mr. Bechtolsheim and Mr. Cheriton are the sole investors in Arista, and they are known in Silicon Valley as men with a golden touch. In 1996, Cisco acquired a company they started, Granite Systems, for $220 million, and they helped Cisco turn the technology into top-selling products. They formed another start-up, Kealia, to make computer servers, and sold that company to Sun in 2004. Mr. Bechtolsheim remained with Sun and worked on some of its switching products while developing Arista as a side project. Mr. Bechtolsheim and Mr. Cheriton were also early investors in Google and VMware and became billionaires when those companies turned into big successes. With Arista, the pair sought to develop products that took advantage of some of the sophisticated software concepts Mr. Cheriton has explored as an academic. They decided to focus on switches that shuttle Internet traffic using the 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard, which is many times faster than the Gigabit Ethernet standard that dominates data centers today. Switches are the most common hardware used to funnel information between computing systems in a network. The key to Arista’s switches is the structure of the software that manages them. A typical switch from Cisco is rich in features, but has up to 20 million lines of software code and may run on relatively slow processors. Arista breaks all of the major and minor tasks into their own modules that can be updated individually and uses more powerful chips to run it all. Mr. Bechtolsheim said the design would let Arista make quick changes to products  even while they were running  and would also open an interface for customers to more easily add their own features. “My iPhone runs better software than a typical switch,” Mr. Bechtolsheim said. "It is just mind-boggling that the cheapest consumer product has more robust software than what the Internet runs on." In addition, Arista packages its equipment in compact cases that allow more connections at a much cheaper price than Cisco’s bulkier machines. Lean staffing also helps Arista keep its costs down. The Menlo Park, Calif., company has fewer than 50 employees and started shipping systems a few months ago even though it had no formal chief executive. “One mistake a lot of start-ups make with the encouragement of venture capitalists is to hire the whole management team upfront,” said Mr. Bechtolsheim. “You have a lot of people twiddling their thumbs and spending money.” The knocks on Cisco’s expensive gear are nothing new. “Cisco doesn’t price based on cost,” said Joe Skorupa, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm. “They price based on a willingness to pay.” In Cisco’s defense, Inbar Lasser-Raab, a marketing director at the company, said that Cisco had been working on this technology since 2003 and believed it could “provide great value” for customers. Established switch makers like Juniper Networks and Force10 Networks, along with start-ups like Woven Systems, have also charged after the 10 Gigabit Ethernet market for years. Mr. Bechtolsheim said these companies’ products were too expensive or too early in the market. Arista argues that its products are well positioned to provide fast connections to laboratories with large numbers of servers or companies with heavy Web traffic. Ms. Ullal said she expected the market for 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches, less than $1 billion today, to grow to as much as $5 billion within three years. Despite higher costs, Cisco remains a dominant force in networking because of its solid reputation. Few companies will risk what amounts to the central nervous system of their networks to an unproven player. But Arista said that labs and Web-centric companies that did custom work would try something new. Early customers include Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Northwestern University and start-ups like BitGravity, an online video delivery company. “In cases where someone comes to market with something compelling, we’re willing to take the risk,” said Perry Wu, BitGravity’s chief executive. If it is successful, Arista would be a prime acquisition target for Cisco or another hardware player like Hewlett-Packard, which has bulked up its networking business. Ms. Ullal and Mr. Bechtolsheim said that was not their goal. “If Andy wanted to sell this company to someone else, he didn’t need me,” Ms. Ullal said. “We are here to build a company.” Mr. Bechtolsheim added that he was willing to finance the venture through to an initial public offering. Mr. Bechtolsheim’s departure will certainly be a big blow to Sun, which is wrestling with declining sales and profits and a plunging stock price. But he said he would retain a part-time advisory role at the company. “It’s my baby,” Mr. Bechtolsheim said. “I will always be associated with Sun.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on October 23, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.MENLO PARK, Calif.  Andreas von Bechtolsheim, a brilliant billionaire who has created some of the best-selling computer systems in the industry, is resigning as chief architect of Sun Microsystems to focus on a start-up that is challenging another industry giant, Cisco Systems.

A Dilbert-like sea of cubicles, a bulletin board plastered with outdated memos, a dreary lunchroom? Chances are, you can also picture the standard work space there, whether it is one of those cubicles, a desk out in the open or, for the lucky ones, an actual office. Skip to next paragraph That type of workplace is alien to a growing number of workers. In industries from technology to finance to sales, nonassigned work spaces  also known as nonterritorial work spaces, mobile platforms and hot desks  are gaining popularity. In some divisions of Bank of America, employees can reserve unassigned work spaces or meeting rooms in various bank locations. At Sabre Holdings, teams are assigned to neighborhoods of workspaces, and employees find places for themselves when they arrive. (The early birds can get seats near the windows.) Thousands of Cisco Systems employees sit at unassigned desks in team rooms interspersed with communal break areas. And at some I.B.M. divisions, only a small percentage of employees  mostly top executives and their assistants  have fixed desks or offices. To a peripatetic journalist like me, the appeal of a mobile workspace is clear. Armed with my laptop and cellphone, I have conducted interviews from my car, from Starbucks and even from an empty room in a doctor’s office. Employers benefit from these setups, too, both by cutting real estate costs and by increasing their appeal to younger workers who tend to prefer jobs that let them work anywhere and any time. But a traditional office has its advantages. Its workers can have neighbors, for example, and pictures on the wall. It can also provide a sense of community and a predictable structure. Therein lies the challenge for managers seeking more fluid spaces: how to offer flexibility but keep employees feeling connected and engaged. “The biggest issue is maintaining the culture of the organization,” said Joseph Brancato, a regional managing principal at Gensler, which was the designer of the interior of the new headquarters of The New York Times. “It comes down to, ‘Can you maximize people’s performance utilizing the least amount of real estate?’ If you cut it back too far, you’re going to impact performance. You’ve got to find that sweet spot.” Several early experiments with non-assigned work spaces were short-lived. For example, Chiat/Day, the advertising firm that is now TBWA/Chiat/Day, designed an office in 1994 using what was called hoteling, in which employees were assigned a desk and computer when they arrived. The company expected people to work elsewhere much of the time, but they kept coming in, and the staff kept expanding, creating logjams and equipment shortages, a spokesman said. Eventually, it reverted to assigned work spaces, though with more communal break areas. New technology has since made it far easier to work anywhere, and employers are looking at unassigned work spaces with renewed enthusiasm. Mr. Brancato says the number of inquiries he receives about flexible spaces has grown sharply in the last six months. But nontraditional offices don’t work for everyone. A study of office workers in Britain by Lynne Millward Purvis, a senior lecturer at the University of Surrey, and several colleagues at the University of Exeter found that employees’ identification with their work team was higher if they had assigned tasks. Nonassigned spaces function best when designed primarily to accommodate employees’ work styles, said Mark Golan, a vice president in Cisco’s Internet business solutions group. “The purpose of the work environment today  the reason you come in  is for collaboration,” he said. “An office of cubes works against that.” But if a company cuts office space to save money, for example, then moves to nonassigned desks to squeeze everyone in, the feel of the change will be very different  and probably less popular. Sabre Holdings created its nonassigned work spaces when it was simultaneously unloading two office buildings and trying to foster more teamwork, said Paul Rostron, executive vice president for human resources. There was some apprehension among employees, he said. But they adapted, developing new protocols like talking more quietly and using phone headsets, and Sabre has saved about $10 million a year with the new design, a spokeswoman said. Sabre also created an online social network to help employees feel connected to the company. At I.B.M., about 40 percent of employees are on mobile work schedules, according to a spokeswoman, and non-assigned spaces are a logical byproduct. In the health care and life sciences division, about 1,600 employees always work from home, 600 or so are usually in the office, and about 1,700 alight there from time to time. Those mobile workers share 120 desks and numerous glass-enclosed conference rooms. Dan Pelino, the division’s general manager, said he and the managers in the unit regularly check with mobile employees to make sure they don’t feel isolated. “We have seen this feeling of being cut off,” he said. “It does come up when we have town meetings and the like. But no one is interested in going back to the old way of coming in every day, and bricks and mortar, and who gets the best parking spot.” E-mail: newmanage@nytimes.com.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Peter Wynn Thompson for The New York Times Ciscos TelePresence videoconferencing system includes video cameras and huge displays and allows a company to conduct a virtual meeting across the world. Updates of the system and the WebEx collaboration suite will be announced Wednesday. These days, the company is peddling e-mail software, video conferencing systems, cable TV boxes  even furniture  as it tries to break out of the data center and get its products in front of ordinary office workers. “Cisco is kind of like the Madonna of networking,” said Mark Sue, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “It is continuously trying to reinvent itself.” The effort directly challenges a main area of growth for some of Cisco’s big customers, including I.B.M., Oracle and most pointedly, Microsoft. The line of business, known as unified communications, aims to provide a common set of tools that workers can use to make calls, send e-mail messages, hold Web conferences and send instant messages. On Wednesday, Cisco plans to announce updates to much of the technology behind the effort, including improvements to its TelePresence videoconferencing software and WebEx collaboration suite. Cisco’s strategy is an obvious outgrowth of its acquisition strategy. Over the last four years, the firm, which is based in San Jose, Calif., bought 36 companies, including WebEx, a Web meeting specialist, for $3.2 billion. In recent weeks, Cisco also picked up PostPath, a maker of e-mail software, and Jabber, a leader in corporate instant messaging. Although Cisco has not yet formally bundled all of these services together into a single suite, the company said it intended to move in that direction. Microsoft, the maker of Windows and Office software, is not amused. The company dominates the market for the communications software used by office workers and takes in more than $1 billion in annual revenue from its SharePoint collaboration software, which executives consider one of their shining stars. Zig Serafin, the general manager of Microsoft’s Unified Communications Group, said Cisco’s core business was “under siege” and that had forced the company into unfamiliar territory as a software player. “They are trying to stick together acquired applications, and the approach they have taken is largely piecemeal,” he said. Nikos Theodosopoulos, an analyst at UBS, said Cisco’s move could have consequences. “We’ll see if Microsoft will try to do more business with Cisco competitors like Juniper or Nortel or whomever,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Peter Wynn Thompson for The New York Times Ciscos TelePresence videoconferencing system includes video cameras and huge displays and allows a company to conduct a virtual meeting across the world. Updates of the system and the WebEx collaboration suite will be announced Wednesday. These days, the company is peddling e-mail software, video conferencing systems, cable TV boxes  even furniture  as it tries to break out of the data center and get its products in front of ordinary office workers. “Cisco is kind of like the Madonna of networking,” said Mark Sue, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “It is continuously trying to reinvent itself.” The effort directly challenges a main area of growth for some of Cisco’s big customers, including I.B.M., Oracle and most pointedly, Microsoft. The line of business, known as unified communications, aims to provide a common set of tools that workers can use to make calls, send e-mail messages, hold Web conferences and send instant messages. On Wednesday, Cisco plans to announce updates to much of the technology behind the effort, including improvements to its TelePresence videoconferencing software and WebEx collaboration suite. Cisco’s strategy is an obvious outgrowth of its acquisition strategy. Over the last four years, the firm, which is based in San Jose, Calif., bought 36 companies, including WebEx, a Web meeting specialist, for $3.2 billion. In recent weeks, Cisco also picked up PostPath, a maker of e-mail software, and Jabber, a leader in corporate instant messaging. Although Cisco has not yet formally bundled all of these services together into a single suite, the company said it intended to move in that direction. Microsoft, the maker of Windows and Office software, is not amused. The company dominates the market for the communications software used by office workers and takes in more than $1 billion in annual revenue from its SharePoint collaboration software, which executives consider one of their shining stars. Zig Serafin, the general manager of Microsoft’s Unified Communications Group, said Cisco’s core business was “under siege” and that had forced the company into unfamiliar territory as a software player. “They are trying to stick together acquired applications, and the approach they have taken is largely piecemeal,” he said.

Cisco, the networking equipment company, rose more than 5 percent after it posted earnings late Tuesday that narrowly topped Wall Street’s forecast. The report lifted the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index. Wall Street’s huge rally on Tuesday looked as if it might not hold in early trading on Wednesday. Investors began the day fearing more industrywide write-downs of bad home loans after the mortgage financier Freddie Mac reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss. But the continued decline in oil prices, which is what propelled the market sharply higher on Tuesday, helped calm investors. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.30, or 0.35 percent, to 11,656.07, after having been down nearly 100 points early in the session.

Freddie Mac, which substantially increased its reserves for bad loans, lost about three times what Wall Street expected on a share basis. The company also announced that it expected to cut its third-quarter dividend. The well-being of Freddie Mac and its fellow mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, is a big concern on Wall Street as the government-chartered companies hold or back nearly half of all American mortgage debt. The companies have lost billions of dollars because of failed loans over the last year, and the federal government has pledged to help both companies with larger lines of credit or stock purchases if necessary.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images John T. Chambers called it a very solid quarter for Cisco. Cisco, the largest maker of networking equipment, said its net income in the fourth quarter rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier to $2 billion, or 33 cents a share. Revenue climbed 10 percent, to $10.4 billion. Excluding one-time items, Cisco had earnings of 40 cents a share, beating the expectations of Wall Street analysts by a penny, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. “It’s still a tough environment out there, but Cisco has delivered very strong results, with revenue exceeding $10 billion for the first time in the company’s history,” said Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Sue said the company was benefiting from having a diverse portfolio of products as well as a balance of domestic and international sales. Cisco shares rose about 7 percent in after-hours trading after release of the report. In regular trading they rose 66 cents, or 3 percent, to close at $22.65. John T. Chambers, the chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts that it had been “a very solid quarter for Cisco, particularly given the challenges we are all seeing.” He added: “We all see the same mixed signals in the market, from both a U.S. perspective and other parts of the world, in terms of economic momentum, stock market behavior, energy costs and confidence challenges.” Mr. Chambers said he was “very comfortable” with the company’s long-term growth target of 12 to 17 percent, and he described the problems in the marketplace as “relatively short term.” He added, however, that he expected the challenges would last through the next few quarters. For the full year, Cisco’s earnings were $8.1 billion, or $1.31 a share, on sales of $39.5 billion. In the previous fiscal year, net income was $7.3 billion on revenue of $34.9 billion. Cisco’s overall product sales rose 8.8 percent to $8.64 billion, while sales of services climbed 16 percent to $1.72 billion. Mr. Chambers said the company would continue to invest, in hopes of taking advantage of the weak business climate to increase its market share. Citing the economic uncertainty, Cisco executives said that for now they would not give a full-year forecast, instead offering guidance only for the first half of the year. Mr. Chambers forecast that sales would grow 8 percent in the first quarter and 8.5 percent in the second. Mr. Chambers said two sectors that had been among the first to report weakness last year showed strength in the fourth quarter: the financial industry and large multinational corporations. The report was closely watched on Wall Street for signs that the economy was slowing. Cisco is the leading seller of routers and switches used by telecommunications companies and other large enterprises. Such companies tend to scale back technology investments during a slowdown.

The deals involve $8 billion in Chinese investments and purchases of aircraft engines, telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and electronic components, said Chen Deming, minister of commerce in China. He added that $6 billion in other deals involved American purchases and investments in China. Among the American companies signing deals at the United States Chamber of Commerce were Chrysler, Cisco Systems, Ford Motor, General Motors, I.B.M., Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who will be leading a delegation of Bush administration officials at the talks beginning on Tuesday in Annapolis, Md., said the sessions were not meant to resolve specific disputes but instead to discuss how to overcome economic downturns and deal with impending crises in energy and the environment. ''The tone will be one of constructive engagement,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview on Monday. ''We're going to be dealing with some of the most fundamental economic issues there are. I know some people would like to see quick fixes. But the most important issues don't avail themselves to quick fixes.'' On Wednesday afternoon, the Chinese delegation is scheduled to meet with President Bush at the White House. The Annapolis talks are the fourth in a twice-a-year series that Mr. Paulson started when he left Goldman Sachs to become Treasury chief in 2006. The biggest issue at the time was American irritation over China's intervention in currency markets to purchase dollars and keep the value of the dollar high in relation to China's currency. Since mid-2005, China has allowed its currency, the yuan, to appreciate nearly 20 percent, easing at least some of the criticism in Congress. The Bush administration continues to accuse China of raising barriers to foreign investment, and China has increasingly complained that its attempts to invest in America often provoke an outcry. Mr. Paulson said that, although China had made only limited reforms in its economy and had taken limited steps to open its market to American goods and investment, the ''strategic economic dialogue,'' known as the S.E.D., produced more progress than otherwise would have been the case. ''I would argue that the reason we've made progress is that the S.E.D. is a mechanism for convincing China that certain things are in their interest,'' he said, citing American efforts to get China to open its economy to foreign investment and to lift government subsidies of export industries. In recent months, the Chinese government has pushed back with tough-talking demands that the United States do more to open its own economy to Chinese investments and to halt the depreciation of the dollar against European and other currencies, a trend many economists say has helped drive up oil and food prices. The Chinese delegation will be led by Wang Qishan, a vice premier and former mayor of Beijing, and also a graduate of Northwestern University, who took office as his country's chief economic negotiator earlier this year. He succeeded Wu Yi, one of the highest-ranking women in China and often described as a tough negotiator. Mr. Paulson said that though China had lately stepped up its criticism of the United States, ''I sure didn't find Wu Yi to be a shrinking violet.''</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE4D91F3CF93AA35756C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=ciscosystemsinc">F.B.I. Says the Military Had Bogus Computer Gear<date>Published: May 9, 2008</date><text>Counterfeit products are a routine threat for the electronics industry. However, the more sinister specter of an electronic Trojan horse, lurking in the circuitry of a computer or a network router and allowing attackers clandestine access or control, was raised again recentlyby the F.B.I. and the Pentagon. The new law enforcement and national security concerns were prompted by Operation Cisco Raider, which has led to 15 criminal cases involving counterfeit products bought in part by military agencies, military contractors and electric power companies in the United States. Over the two-year operation, 36 search warrants have been executed, resulting in the discovery of 3,500 counterfeit Cisco network components with an estimated retail value of more than $3.5 million, the F.B.I. said in a statement. The F.B.I. is still not certain whether the ring's actions were for profit or part of a state-sponsored intelligence effort. The potential threat, according to the F.B.I. agents who gave a briefing at the Office of Management and Budget on Jan. 11, includes the remote jamming of supposedly secure computer networks and gaining access to supposedly highly secure systems. Contents of the briefing were contained in a PowerPoint presentation leaked to a Web site, Above Top Secret. A Cisco spokesman said that the company had investigated the counterfeit gear seized by law enforcement agencies and had not found any secret back door. ''We did not find any evidence of re-engineering in the manner that was described in the F.B.I. presentation,'' said John Noh, a Cisco spokesman. He added that the company believed the counterfeiters were interested in copying high volume products to make a quick profit. ''We know what these counterfeiters are about.'' An F.B.I. spokeswoman, Catherine L. Milhoan, said the agency was not suggesting that the Chinese government was involved in the counterfeiting ring. ''We worked very closely with the Chinese government,'' she said. Arrests have been made in China as part of the investigation, she said. ''The existence of this document shows that the cyber division of the F.B.I. has growing concerns about the production and distribution of counterfeit network hardware.'' Despite Cisco's reassurance, a number of industry executives and technologists said that the threat of secretly added circuitry intended to subvert computer and network gear is real. ''There are enormous vulnerabilities in our defense and national security infrastructure,'' said Peter Levin, a former Clinton administration official who is chief executive of DAFCA, a Framingham, Mass., company that designs systems to prevent malicious tampering with computer chips. ''We outsource the manufacturing of computer integrated circuits to places that can manufacture these devices cheaply.'' Last month, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency began distributing chips with hidden Trojan horse circuitry to military contractors who are participating in the agency's Trusted Integrated Circuits program. The goal is to test forensic techniques for finding hidden electronic trap doors, which can be maddeningly elusive. The agency is not yet ready to announce the results of the test, according to Jan Walker, a spokeswoman for the agency. The threat was demonstrated in April when a team of computer scientists from the University of Illinois presented a paper at a technical conference in San Francisco detailing how they had modified a Sun Microsystems SPARC microprocessor by altering the data file on a chip with nearly 1.8 million circuits used in automated manufacturing equipment. The researchers were able to create a stealth system that would allow them to automatically log in to a computer and steal passwords. The danger of such hidden circuitry is that it could potentially undermine the strongest computer security protections by essentially giving an attacker a secret key to gain access to a network or a computer. ''It's very difficult to detect and discover these issues,'' said Ted Vucurevich, the chief technology officer of Cadence Design Systems, a company that provides design tools for chip makers. ''That was one of the reasons'' for the testing program. Modern integrated circuits have billions of components, he said: ''Adding a small number that do particular functions in particular cases is incredibly hard to detect.'' The potential threat of secret hardware-based backdoors or kill switches has been discussed for several decades. For example, the issue came up during the 1980s with a Swiss cryptography company, Crypto, which has been under suspicion of having installed back doors in its systems to give the National Security Agency access to encoded messages. The issue was raised again during the first Iraq war and more recently in the Israeli bombing of a suspected Syrian nuclear plant. In both cases there has been speculation that booby-trapped antiaircraft equipment had been remotely turned off.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/technology/07cisco-web.html?ref=ciscosystemsinc">Revenue Up, but Income Falls at Cisco<date>Published: May 7, 2008</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO  Cisco Systems reported Tuesday that its sales grew in the third quarter despite continued concerns about an economic slowdown. Company earnings topped Wall Street’s forecasts and shares rose in after-market trading. Skip to next paragraph Related Cisco Statement Cisco, the networking company, reported earnings of 38 cents a share, up from 36 cents a share, beating analysts’ projections by two cents a share. Including items, the company’s profit in the third quarter declined to $1.8 billion, or 29 cents a share, from $1.9 billion, or 30 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The figures included a 4-cents-a-share acquisition-related charge. The company said revenue increased 10 percent to $9.8 billion, from $8.9 billion. “In the quarter, Cisco delivered solid financial results driven by our focus on innovation, our broad and growing global footprint, and our teams’ focus on delivering results,” the chief executive, John Chambers, said. Cisco, a bellwether stock for the technology industry, issued its report after the close of regular trading Tuesday. Cisco shares rose as high as $27.05 in after-hours trade after closing up 5 cents at $26.33, before the report. Cisco’s earnings are considered an indicator of economic growth because the company’s products are bought by telecommunications companies and other large enterprises that scale back technology investments in a weakening economy. Last week, Sun Microsystems blamed the faltering economy for its swing back into the red in the March quarter. Cisco executives had said in February that they were forecasting a slowdown in orders for the third quarter as European and American customers appeared to be tightening technology spending. At the time, Mr. Chambers predicted that sales would grow only 10 percent, rather than the company’s earlier long-term growth estimate of 12 percent to 17 percent, and that Cisco would probably finish the year at the low end of its guidance.

The company said revenue increased 10 percent to $9.8 billion, from $8.9 billion. “In the quarter, Cisco delivered solid financial results driven by our focus on innovation, our broad and growing global footprint, and our teams’ focus on delivering results,” the chief executive, John Chambers, said. Cisco, a bellwether stock for the technology industry, issued its report after the close of regular trading Tuesday. Cisco shares rose as high as $27.05 in after-hours trade after closing up 5 cents at $26.33, before the report. Cisco’s earnings are considered an indicator of economic growth because the company’s products are bought by telecommunications companies and other large enterprises that scale back technology investments in a weakening economy. Last week, Sun Microsystems blamed the faltering economy for its swing back into the red in the March quarter. Cisco executives had said in February that they were forecasting a slowdown in orders for the third quarter as European and American customers appeared to be tightening technology spending. At the time, Mr. Chambers predicted that sales would grow only 10 percent, rather than the company’s earlier long-term growth estimate of 12 percent to 17 percent, and that Cisco would probably finish the year at the low end of its guidance.</text></article></page></root>
