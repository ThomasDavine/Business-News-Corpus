The move shows that the competition authorities will demand at least some remedial action by the two companies. The statement is being sent by the European Commission to the two companies this week, the person said. The person asked not to be identified because the objections had not been formally announced. The commission said in August that it would conduct an in-depth review of the proposed combination, citing “concerns in a number of areas, in particular in the field of derivatives trading and clearing.” That announcement came after the two companies’ shareholders in July gave their blessing to a deal, which would create a giant international market with large presences in stocks and options and a commanding position in European derivatives. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Europe Opens Broad Review of Deal (Aug. 4, 2011) The issuing of a statement of objection is a normal part of the review, in which the authorities detail their antitrust concerns, and does not necessarily mean the deal is endangered. In addition to the derivatives and clearing concerns, it could encompass issues including job cuts and the preservation of financial activities in various cities. Opponents of the proposed merger are hoping that the commission will demand that the companies sell the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, or Liffe, which Euronext acquired in 2002, five years before Euronext was itself acquired by the New York Stock Exchange. Such a move might lead the partners to reconsider the logic behind the merger. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse Kevin McPartland, head of fixed income research at the TABB Group, said the European regulators were looking at the impact on a regional level, while antitrust authorities in the United States — who saw a combined entity competing globally with rivals in New York and Singapore — had taken a more global view in granting their approval. If the companies were told to sell Liffe as a condition for approval, he said, “it would look a lot less appealing.” But he added: “There are enough potential compromises that they could work through most concerns.” Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, declined to comment beyond noting that the deadline for a decision was Dec. 13. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse also declined to comment. Reuters earlier reported the statement of objections.

Net income decreased 16 percent to $154 million from $184 million a year earlier, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Excluding some items, earnings dropped to 61 cents a share, exceeding the 60-cent average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The results sent the company’s shares down nearly 5 percent, or $1.60, to $31.40. Deutsche Börse’s planned purchase of the parent company would create the world’s largest exchange operator, expanding NYSE Euronext’s revenue from European derivatives. Some of NYSE Euronext’s sales depend on the volume of shares that change hands each day, and trading on American exchanges last quarter fell 9.6 percent from the first quarter, according to the daily average compiled by Bloomberg. It “was a modestly disappointing quarter for NYSE Euronext,” Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst with Raymond James Financial, wrote in a note. “We had expected more momentum from the firm’s data center initiative while operating expenses continue to creep up.” Net revenue from the company’s derivatives unit, which accounted for about 32 percent of the total, fell 5.8 percent to $213 million. Revenue from equity trading and listings increased 1.9 percent to $327 million, according to the statement. Fixed operating expenses climbed 2.9 percent to $419 million. NYSE Amex sold almost 53 percent of its options market to seven brokers, winning regulatory approval for the plan last quarter. The European Commission sent a survey last month with 165 questions to Deutsche Börse’s rivals and customers, asking if the deal with NYSE Euronext would reduce competition and what effect it would have on access to market data. The European Union’s antitrust agency set an Aug. 4 deadline to rule on the deal. Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, said Tuesday in a conference call that this was part of the first phase of the European regulatory review. Deutsche Börse, based in Frankfurt, reported last week that second-quarter profit rose 11 percent as it cut costs, while the Nasdaq OMX Group, NYSE Euronext’s smaller rival, posted quarterly earnings that beat analyst estimates, as acquisitions and listings services helped increase revenue.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/deutsche-borse-wins-shareholder-approval-of-nyse-euronext-deal/?ref=nyseeuronext">Deutsche Börse Shareholders Approve Deal With NYSE<date>July 14, 2011, 11:42 am</date><text>Alex Domanski/ReutersThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany is operated by Deutsche Börse. 9:39 p.m. | Updated Deutsche Börse said on Thursday that it had won shareholder support for its $9 billion merger with NYSE Euronext.

By Wednesday afternoon, Deutsche Börse said that it had received 60.2 percent of outstanding shares. But under German market rules, it must collect 75 percent by midnight Central European time. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The exchange operator does not expect to know the final tally until later this week, possibly not until Friday. In last-minute discussions this week, Deutsche Börse told investors it would not extend the deadline. The tender offer is the biggest hurdle yet for Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext. The exchanges are hoping to create a trans-Atlantic colossus in an industry that increasingly prizes scale and a global footprint. Rivals have failed in their proposed market mergers. A tie-up of the London Stock Exchange and the TMX Group of Canada collapsed amid nationalistic concerns, while a regulator blocked a combination of the Singapore and Australian stock exchanges. Deutsche Börse has made significant strides in the tender offer since July 6, when it reported having collected only 11.1 percent of its outstanding shares. On Tuesday, the company reported having received about 34.5 percent of shares. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext had argued repeatedly that the majority of shareholders would tender their holdings close to the deadline. Some investors had waited for the results of NYSE Euronext’s shareholder vote on the merger last Thursday before voting, to make sure that proposal passed. NYSE shareholders owning 65.7 percent of its stock approved the deal. Last month, the two companies added a sweetener to the deal, promising to pay shareholders of the combined exchange operator a special dividend. People close to the German market operator conceded that the results of the tender offer could be close, but remained hopeful that they would cross the 75 percent threshold. But more hurdles remain since the deal must still be blessed by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. While the merger is expected to easily win approval from American antitrust officials, their European counterparts could more closely scrutinize the proposal, given that the tie-up would combine two of the Continent’s big derivatives markets. Legal teams for both companies have been meeting with European Union competition regulators, with the aim of reaching a second phase of the review next month. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext officials hope to receive a final decision by early next year. Shares in Deutsche Börse closed up 1.68 percent on Wednesday, at 53.29 euros. Shares in NYSE Euronext rose 1.99 percent, to $33.85.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/two-votes-one-hurdle-for-nyse-deutsche-merger/?ref=nyseeuronext">One Vote Down, One to Go for N.Y.S.E. and Deutsche Borse Merger<date>July 7, 2011, 8:53 am</date><text>Henny Ray Abrams/Associated PressThe floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 8:48 a.m. | Updated With NYSE Euronext shareholders approving the merger with Deutsche Börse, the fate of the exchange merger lies across the Atlantic. On Thursday, more than 65 percent of NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the deal. The odds of a deal increased sharply in May once the Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their rival offer for the New York Stock Exchange operator. Last month, both companies also agreed to pay out a special dividend to shareholders to help sweeten the proposal. Several proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended that shareholders back the merger. Still, the deal is not done. Deutsche Börse’s shareholders have about a week to tender their shares in support of the merger. The German exchange operator must win the support of 75 percent of shareholders by July 13. Thus far, about 11.11 percent of investors have tendered their shares, according to regulatory documents filed by Deutsche Börse. People involved in the process say that even that is not too much of a problem, given that many investors are likely to tender their shares in the last few days before the deadline. Some shareholders might also have been waiting for the results of NYSE Euronext’s vote before lending their support. Deutsche Börse can also ask for a deadline extension of up to two weeks, if necessary.

NYSE Euronext handily won shareholder support on Thursday for its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse. But executives at the American exchange operator conceded that they have more work to do to complete the merger. The deal was approved by shareholders who own nearly 65.7 percent of NYSE Euronext’s outstanding shares, officials announced at a shareholder meeting at the New York Stock Exchange. Of the shares that were voted, 96.1 percent were in favor of the merger. The final tally is expected to be disclosed on Friday. Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, admitted to being a little disheartened by the somewhat low turnout, though he said remained pleased by the overall outcome. “I’m a little disappointed, but the top 100 shareholders voted,” he said at a news conference after the shareholder meeting. He added: “Getting 96 percent of the people who voted was a success.” Thursday’s vote is not the final step remaining to closing the deal, however. Deutsche Börse shareholders have until July 13 to tender their shares in support of the transaction. It is a tougher hurdle to meet, because 75 percent of the German exchange’s outstanding shares must be tendered for the deal to pass. As of Wednesday, about 11.11 percent of Deutsche Börse shareholders have done so. But Mr. Niederauer said that many of those investors had been waiting for the NYSE Euronext vote before tendering their holdings. He added that the current number was both typical at this stage and a little higher than his team had anticipated. He expected to close the gap by next week and did not anticipate Deutsche Börse needing to extend its deadline.

That would pave the way for a decision by early next year. He added that any discussion of divestitures to satisfy antitrust concerns was premature, though any request to sell off a major part of the business would be “unprecedented.” During the meeting, some shareholders had expressed concern about what changes to corporate governance the merger would bring. The combined exchange operator would be incorporated in the Netherlands, with directors given four-year terms. But NYSE Euronext officials added that shareholders would have a say on directors’ pay, and would directly set the pay levels for nonexecutive board members.

Shares in the London market operator jumped 11 percent on Thursday, one day after the company’s proposed merger with Canada’s TMX Group failed to gain enough investor support. Almost immediately, shareholders and analysts turned their eyes to Nasdaq, whose joint bid (with the IntercontinentalExchange) for NYSE Euronext fell through just one month ago. There’s certainly history there: Nasdaq famously pursued the London Stock Exchange for more than a year, before staunch opposition to the proposed trans-Atlantic merger forced the American exchange to withdraw. Nasdaq officials have been studying their options for potential future deals, including a possible tie-up with the London exchange, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. But those discussions are highly preliminary and may not lead to anything. Yet Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange in some ways are turning to second-choice merger partners, after having seen their original proposals fall through. Nasdaq’s bid for NYSE Euronext cratered because of the Justice Department’s concerns about a combination of the two big American stock exchanges. And the London Stock Exchange and TMX said this week that while they had gained the support of a majority of shareholders, they had failed to win the backing of the requisite two-thirds majority. Combining Nasdaq and the London exchange still makes sense, according to Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. Nasdaq would gain a presence in Western Europe that would bridge the geographical gap between its operations in the United States and in the Nordic region. And the combination would likely yield a number of attractive cost savings, he added. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links London and Toronto Call Off Merger And ultimately, both companies are likely to still feel pressure about gaining scale, especially in the wake of NYSE Euronext’s planned merger with Deutsche Börse. “All the failed deals of late might make you think that there won’t be as much consolidation as people once thought,” Mr. Ditmire told DealBook. “But I think it’s the opposite.” Which isn’t to say that combining the American and British exchanges will be easy. Regulatory scrutiny and nationalistic sentiment helped fell previous proposals, and such concerns may haunt future mergers. It is unclear, for instance, whether Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange would be the senior partner in a tie-up. While the two exchanges have roughly the same market value, about $4.4 billion, the London exchange has less net debt and more untapped borrowing capacity, Mr. Ditmire said. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a note that “we believe a possible combination with LSE would be consistent with NDAQ’s strategy of building scale in cash equities.” But the analysts doubted whether London would engage in friendly negotiations. And even in the event of an amicable tie-up, resolving cultural issues would take some work. “We believe the lesson learned could be that deals have to be the optimal transactions where competing bids and arguments based on nationalism are minimized,” Richard Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &amp; Partners, wrote in a research note on Thursday. “Global exchange consolidation is not off the table but rather has a higher bar than what some management and investment banking advisors had previously suspected.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/proxy-firm-backs-nyse-deutsche-merger/?ref=nyseeuronext">Proxy Firm Backs NYSE-Deutsche Merger<date>June 27, 2011, 9:52 am</date><text>Henny Ray Abrams/Associated PressThe New York Stock Exchange is lit after trading hours.

Nasdaq OMX, which last month withdrew its unsolicited bid for the owner of the Big Board last month in the face of antitrust concerns, is now weighing a deal to partner with the clearinghouse, a move that would increase its international exposure, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. The talks to tie LCH.Clearnet more closely to an exchange come as regulators in the United States and Europe try to bring more transparency to the huge over-the-counter derivatives market, another reaction to the financial crisis. Clearinghouses guarantee that trades, once made, are actually settled, ensuring that transactions go through even in the event that a counterparty becomes insolvent. Nasdaq OMX already operates the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearinghouse founded in 2007 that settles interest-rate swaps and various fixed-income derivatives. LCH.Clearnet said last month that it had “received various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other cooperation,” without naming the interested parties. At the time, it described the talks as being at a “preliminary stage.” It declined to comment on Friday. LCH.Clearnet has already been approached by Markit and NYSE Euronext, which would consider a joint bid, a person familiar with the matter said. The Big Board would be the minority partner in the bid, the person said. On Thursday, LCH.Clearnet and NYSE Euronext extended their clearing arrangements in Europe until mid-2013. NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, Duncan L. Niederauer, said in a statement Thursday that the clearinghouse was “considering its own strategic options” even as his exchange was finalizing its merger with Deutsche Börse. He noted that “this extension gives both parties the time needed for these strategies to crystallize.”</text></article><article index="11" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/deutsche-borse-sweetens-nyse-bid/?ref=nyseeuronext">Deutsche Borse Sweetens NYSE Bid<date>June 7, 2011, 12:48 pm</date><text>NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse announced on Tuesday that they would pay shareholders a special dividend in an effort to secure support for their merger deal.

Nasdaq, fierce rivals with the N.Y.S.E. for years, had sought to derail a planned merger between NYSE Euronext and the Deutsche Borse. In April, the Nasdaq OMX Group joined forces with the IntercontinentalExchange, known as ICE, a commodities futures and derivatives marketplace, to make a bid for NYSE Euronext. Under their proposal, Nasdaq would take the Big Board, while the IntercontinentalExchange would get the NYSE's derivatives business. But their counteroffer was met from the outset with skepticism about whether Washington would allow the two markets that have the stock listings of nearly every American company to combine. In a statement, the Justice Department said on Monday that it had told the companies that it would file an antitrust lawsuit to block a deal. Christine A. Varney, the department's antitrust chief, said in the statement: ''The acquisition would have removed incentives for competitive pricing, high quality of service and innovation in the listing, trading and data services these exchange operators provide to the investing public and to new and established companies that need access to U.S. stock markets.'' Nasdaq and the IntercontinentalExchange said that they had tried to assuage regulators' concerns, in part by offering to sell off certain businesses, but that it was not enough. Still, Nasdaq's move disappointed investors who had hoped the counterbid might prompt a sweetened offer from Deutsche Borse. Shares of NYSE Euronext fell 12.6 percent on Monday. Shares of Nasdaq OMX fell 2.5 percent. The withdrawn bid is another failed attempt by Mr. Greifeld and Nasdaq to find a partner as a wave of consolidation washes over the world's exchanges. In 2006, it began a long but ultimately frustrated bid to acquire the London Stock Exchange. Some analysts say the pursuit of NYSE Euronext was the best of a number of bad options for a company fearful of being left out of the push toward bigger, more global exchange operators. ''It underscores the strategic quandary they have,'' said Justin Schack, an analyst with Rosenblatt Securities. ''They are facing the same set of issues - it's just maybe they are more acutely felt now because there will be a competitor that is stronger in so many different areas.'' He added: ''And the number of options they have seem to be dwindling.'' One of those options could again be the London Stock Exchange, particularly if the London exchange's planned merger with the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange is derailed by a rival bid. A consortium called the Maple Group Acquisition Corporation, which includes Canadian banks and pension funds, is seeking keep the exchange domestically owned and merge it with its chief competitor. A combination between the Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange would create a trans-Atlantic listings powerhouse. Yet some analysts say such a deal would find little shareholder support after the last attempt. Another possibility would be to plant a flag in Asia, a rapidly growing market with fewer competitive concerns than in the United States and European markets. The Singapore Exchange is run by Magnus Bocker, a former chief executive of the Nordic exchange operator OMX, which was acquired by Mr. Greifeld in 2007. Nasdaq might also try to acquire smaller exchanges, like Bats Global or DirectEdge, although any such deal could face the same regulatory scrutiny caused by the Big Board deal. Nasdaq could also find itself the target of a buyout from either the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the IntercontinentalExchange. Exchange operators have been seeking to merge in recent years in an effort to give investors faster transactions and improved liquidity. Also driving consolidation is the potential for lower fixed costs, which means that the more trades an exchange can run through its platform, the better. In addition, many firms are trying to diversify both their products and geographic range to gain an edge over competitors and secure long-term growth potential. Some planned mergers, however, have run into obstacles. A proposed merger between the stock exchanges in Singapore and Australia was blocked by Australian regulators. ''Trying to predict which way a regulatory or political body is going to rule is very difficult,'' said Richard Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill, an investment banking and brokerage firm. ''The whole exchange consolidation movement is very much under the influence of the rulings of those decision makers.'' The NYSE-Deutsche Borse merger is hardly a done deal. It still requires approval by European Union competition authorities. Deutsche Borse's chief executive, Reto Francioni, said last week that Deutsche Borse had ''made significant progress'' with regulators. In a speech on Monday, Joaquin Almunia, the European competition commissioner, mentioned the merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse only in passing. But his remarks suggested that the transaction would be examined carefully. ''We should prevent that any one entity or group controls essential infrastructure - be it a trading platform, a clearing platform or a pretrading service - to the benefit of a restricted few,'' Mr. Almunia said, according to a text of his remarks.

So where does the tie-up between the NYSE and Deutsche Börse stand? In a statement on Monday acknowledging the decision by Nasdaq and ICE, Deutsche Börse said that it “continues to work intensely” to complete the merger with NYSE Euronext. “We are confident that we will be able to complete the merger at the end of this year as planned,” the Deutsche Börse chief executive, Reto Francioni, told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting last week in Frankfurt. Germany’s financial services regulator, known as BaFin, has approved the offer documents for the merger, clearing the way for Deutsche Börse shareholders to exchange their stock for shares in the new company. Shareholders have until July 13 to accept the offer. The merger still requires approval by European Union competition authorities. Mr. Francioni said last week that Deutsche Börse “has made significant progress” with regulators. The deal comes as European Union officials scrutinize the financial services industry more closely. The European Commission has started investigations of several financial companies, including Standard &amp; Poor’s, Thomson Reuters and ICE, to determine whether they are abusing their dominant market positions.

It’s called taking a flier. On Monday, the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange announced they were withdrawing their $11 billion takeover offer for NYSE Euronext, after regulators balked at the deal. “We took the decision to withdraw our offer when it became clear that we would not be successful in securing regulatory approval,” the Nasdaq chief executive, Robert Greifeld, said in a statement. The Justice Department was kind enough to release its own statement, saying “the acquisition would have removed incentives for competitive pricing, high quality of service, and innovation in the listing, trading and data services these exchange operators provide to the investing public and to new and established companies that need access to U.S. stock markets.” The decision is no surprise. It was clear from the start that Nasdaq was fighting an uphill battle to combine with another market stock exchange in the United States. So why did Nasdaq and ICE do it? Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Nasdaq and ICE Drop NYSE Bid DealBook: The State of the Other NYSE Deal There might be several reasons. Nasdaq is concerned about being left out of the rapid global consolidation of the exchange industry. While the failed effort cost it some money, a success would have created the 800-pound gorilla of exchanges. By making a bid, Nasdaq could determine whether the combination was feasible before the opportunity was lost. Nasdaq had the nationalism card to play. It could promote an all-American merger as the best way of keeping the United States competitive on the global scene. But Nasdaq judged incorrectly that this argument would lead the Justice Department to be more conciliatory. Nasdaq’s offer also allowed the exchange to demonstrate that it was still interested in being a global player. In other words, the bid was a signal to the rest of the world’s exchanges that it was open to deal-making. In both of these instances, a bid might have been worthwhile even though Nasdaq knew it only had a marginal passing antitrust muster. This is the second failed gambit by Nasdaq’s chief executive, who unsuccessfully tried to acquire the London Stock Exchange. There will no doubt be talk that he has acted too aggressively and that these reasons do not justify a wasted bid with little chance of success. ICE, too, has tasted failure, losing out to the CME Group in a battle to acquire the Chicago Board of Trade. Nasdaq’s position was further weakened by a second unsurprising event: NYSE Euronext’s opposition. The NYSE leveraged Nasdaq’s and ICE’s disadvantage by refusing to postpone its shareholder meeting. This pushed Nasdaq into fast-paced negotiations with the Justice Department that culminated in the announcment on Monday. A slower approach, accompanied by a threat from Nasdaq to litigate the issue, might have led the Justice Department to be more cooperative. But Nasdaq lacked the time. Additionally, Nasdaq’s nationalism card appeared to be trumped by the public realization that a combined Nasdaq-NYSE would have resulted in severe job losses. As for its favored deal with Deutsche Börse, the NYSE Euronext board is probably feeling vindicated in its rejection of the Nasdaq deal on strategic and antitrust grounds. The deal with Deutsche Börse is now firmly headed for a vote of NYSE shareholders. It remains to be seen whether they will demand a sweetener to approve the deal, but it appears much less likely than last week. NYSE shares were trading down about 10 percent on Monday. Hedge funds, which would be the most likely to push hard for a last-minute price increase, have not been extensive acquirers of NYSE stock, having concluded correctly that Nasdaq was unlikely to receive antitrust clearance. As a result of the share price decline, institutional investors are likely to grudgingly back the current offer. As for Deutsche Börse, the Nasdaq announcement is a godsend. Deutsche Börse’s shareholders stand to own 60 percent of the combined company under the terms of the original offer. What is likely to prove most disappointing for many Americans, there is now less pressure to give the combined company a name to appease United States politicians. If the deal is approved, the result will be a fresh triumph for globalization, and NYSE Euronext will be on a path to becoming a Netherlands-based corporation. Meanwhile, Nasdaq is still looking for its own global partner. With Canadian banks making a rival bid for the TMX Group, that could mean that the London Stock Exchange is once again a potential partner. Steven M.

Under the terms of the deal that was announced this year, Deutsche Börse shareholders would own 60 percent of a new company to be incorporated in the Netherlands. These shareholders would receive a dividend of 2 euros for every share. NYSE Euronext shareholders, under the previously agreed exchange ratio of 0.47 for every share, would get 94 euro cents, or $1.37, shortly after the deal closes.

Mr. Niederauer will be the chief of the yet-unnamed new company. NYSE Euronext shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal on July 7. Deutsche Börse shareholders have a deadline of July 13 to tender their shares. The cost of the payout was estimated to be as much as $905 million. Amid a rival bid from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, there had been speculation that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse would need to pay a special dividend to win over shareholders. But last month, Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid after the Justice Department’s antitrust division said it would challenge a merger.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E1D6173BF934A25756C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=nyseeuronext">Nasdaq Drops a Bid To Buy Rival N.Y.S.E.<date>Published: May 17, 2011</date><text>The operator of the Nasdaq market withdrew its $11 billion rival bid for the New York Stock Exchange's parent on Monday after the Justice Department said it would challenge the deal, raising questions about Nasdaq's next steps as exchanges around the world merge to remain competitive. Nasdaq, fierce rivals with the N.Y.S.E. for years, had sought to derail a planned merger between NYSE Euronext and the Deutsche Borse. In April, the Nasdaq OMX Group joined forces with the IntercontinentalExchange, known as ICE, a commodities futures and derivatives marketplace, to make a bid for NYSE Euronext. Under their proposal, Nasdaq would take the Big Board, while the IntercontinentalExchange would get the NYSE's derivatives business. But their counteroffer was met from the outset with skepticism about whether Washington would allow the two markets that have the stock listings of nearly every American company to combine. In a statement, the Justice Department said on Monday that it had told the companies that it would file an antitrust lawsuit to block a deal. Christine A. Varney, the department's antitrust chief, said in the statement: ''The acquisition would have removed incentives for competitive pricing, high quality of service and innovation in the listing, trading and data services these exchange operators provide to the investing public and to new and established companies that need access to U.S. stock markets.'' Nasdaq and the IntercontinentalExchange said that they had tried to assuage regulators' concerns, in part by offering to sell off certain businesses, but that it was not enough. Still, Nasdaq's move disappointed investors who had hoped the counterbid might prompt a sweetened offer from Deutsche Borse. Shares of NYSE Euronext fell 12.6 percent on Monday. Shares of Nasdaq OMX fell 2.5 percent. The withdrawn bid is another failed attempt by Mr. Greifeld and Nasdaq to find a partner as a wave of consolidation washes over the world's exchanges. In 2006, it began a long but ultimately frustrated bid to acquire the London Stock Exchange. Some analysts say the pursuit of NYSE Euronext was the best of a number of bad options for a company fearful of being left out of the push toward bigger, more global exchange operators. ''It underscores the strategic quandary they have,'' said Justin Schack, an analyst with Rosenblatt Securities. ''They are facing the same set of issues - it's just maybe they are more acutely felt now because there will be a competitor that is stronger in so many different areas.'' He added: ''And the number of options they have seem to be dwindling.'' One of those options could again be the London Stock Exchange, particularly if the London exchange's planned merger with the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange is derailed by a rival bid. A consortium called the Maple Group Acquisition Corporation, which includes Canadian banks and pension funds, is seeking keep the exchange domestically owned and merge it with its chief competitor. A combination between the Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange would create a trans-Atlantic listings powerhouse. Yet some analysts say such a deal would find little shareholder support after the last attempt. Another possibility would be to plant a flag in Asia, a rapidly growing market with fewer competitive concerns than in the United States and European markets. The Singapore Exchange is run by Magnus Bocker, a former chief executive of the Nordic exchange operator OMX, which was acquired by Mr. Greifeld in 2007. Nasdaq might also try to acquire smaller exchanges, like Bats Global or DirectEdge, although any such deal could face the same regulatory scrutiny caused by the Big Board deal. Nasdaq could also find itself the target of a buyout from either the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the IntercontinentalExchange. Exchange operators have been seeking to merge in recent years in an effort to give investors faster transactions and improved liquidity. Also driving consolidation is the potential for lower fixed costs, which means that the more trades an exchange can run through its platform, the better. In addition, many firms are trying to diversify both their products and geographic range to gain an edge over competitors and secure long-term growth potential. Some planned mergers, however, have run into obstacles. A proposed merger between the stock exchanges in Singapore and Australia was blocked by Australian regulators. ''Trying to predict which way a regulatory or political body is going to rule is very difficult,'' said Richard Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill, an investment banking and brokerage firm. ''The whole exchange consolidation movement is very much under the influence of the rulings of those decision makers.'' The NYSE-Deutsche Borse merger is hardly a done deal. It still requires approval by European Union competition authorities. Deutsche Borse's chief executive, Reto Francioni, said last week that Deutsche Borse had ''made significant progress'' with regulators. In a speech on Monday, Joaquin Almunia, the European competition commissioner, mentioned the merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse only in passing. But his remarks suggested that the transaction would be examined carefully. ''We should prevent that any one entity or group controls essential infrastructure - be it a trading platform, a clearing platform or a pretrading service - to the benefit of a restricted few,'' Mr. Almunia said, according to a text of his remarks.

So where does the tie-up between the NYSE and Deutsche Börse stand? In a statement on Monday acknowledging the decision by Nasdaq and ICE, Deutsche Börse said that it “continues to work intensely” to complete the merger with NYSE Euronext. “We are confident that we will be able to complete the merger at the end of this year as planned,” the Deutsche Börse chief executive, Reto Francioni, told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting last week in Frankfurt. Germany’s financial services regulator, known as BaFin, has approved the offer documents for the merger, clearing the way for Deutsche Börse shareholders to exchange their stock for shares in the new company. Shareholders have until July 13 to accept the offer. The merger still requires approval by European Union competition authorities. Mr. Francioni said last week that Deutsche Börse “has made significant progress” with regulators. The deal comes as European Union officials scrutinize the financial services industry more closely. The European Commission has started investigations of several financial companies, including Standard &amp; Poor’s, Thomson Reuters and ICE, to determine whether they are abusing their dominant market positions. In a speech Monday, Joaquín Almunia, vice president of the European Commission responsible for competition policy, mentioned the merger of NYSE and Deutsche Börse only in passing.

NYSE Euronext shareholders expecting the Nasdaq bid to at least extract more from the Deutsche Börse were disappointed, and shares of NYSE Euronext were down more than 10 percent in mid-morning trading. Nasdaq and ICE spent weeks on an unsolicited takeover effort that got heated at times. In April, Nasdaq and ICE made an $11.3 billion takeover offer for the owner of the Big Board, topping a $10 billion friendly merger agreement with Deutsche Börse arranged in February. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release DealBook: Canadian Banks Make Rival Bid for Toronto Exchange The Justice Department statement But NYSE Euronext remained committed to its deal with the owner of the Frankfurt exchange, twice rejecting the rival bidders. The NYSE said that it worried a deal with the United States exchange operators would not clear regulatory hurdles and that it would necessitate unreasonable amounts of debt. “Breaking up NYSE Euronext, burdening the pieces with high levels of debt and destroying its invaluable human capital would be a strategic mistake in terms of where the global markets are going, and is clearly not in the best interests of our shareholders,” the NYSE Euronext chairman, Jan-Michiel Hessels, said in a statement in April. “The highly conditional break-up proposal from Nasdaq/ICE would also require shareholders to shoulder unacceptable execution risk.” Even so, Nasdaq and ICE pushed forward. Earlier this month, they vowed to take the offer directly to NYSE shareholders. On May 9, the two exchange operators issued a letter to NYSE investors, saying the board had failed to provide all of the facts to make an “informed decision” about the deal with Deutsche Börse. “NYSE Euronext’s actions reflect corporate governance at its worst and falls far short of the governance standards they recommend for listed companies,” Nasdaq and ICE wrote. Now, after discussions with the Justice Department’s antitrust division, the companies are pulling their offer for NYSE. Nasdaq and ICE said they had tried to assuage regulators’ concerns, in part by offering to sell off certain businesses, but it was not enough. “We have said from the beginning that NYSE Euronext shareholders should not be forced to vote on their combination with Deutsche Börse while antitrust concerns continued to exist in both the U.S. and the E.U.,” Mr. Greifeld said in a statement. “While we are surprised and disappointed in the Antitrust Division’s conclusion, some of the uncertainty, at least as it relates to our joint proposal, has been resolved.” Christine Varney, the antitrust chief of the Justice Department, said in a statement: “The acquisition would have removed incentives for competitive pricing, high quality of service, and innovation in the listing, trading and data services these exchange operators provide to the investing public and to new and established companies that need access to U.S. stock markets.” Nasdaq and ICE have a mixed deal-making record. Nasdaq tried and failed to buy the London Stock Exchange, while ICE lost out to the CME Group in a battle to acquire the Chicago Board of Trade. On Monday, shares of Nasdaq were down 2.27 percent in premarket trading.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/shunning-nasdaq-linkedin-prepares-for-an-i-p-o-on-the-big-board/?ref=nyseeuronext">Shunning Nasdaq, LinkedIn Prepares a Big Board I.P.O.<date>May 4, 2011, 12:03 pm</date><text>In a coup for the New York Stock Exchange, the business-oriented social networking site LinkedIn said in a filing on Wednesday that it would list its new shares on the Big Board. Last month, LinkedIn, which is expected to go public later this year, said it was still considering a listing on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The decision to go with the Big Board gives a boost to the exchange, which is in the midst of a takeover battle. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The Nasdaq OMX Group, best known as a popular home for technology stocks, recently teamed up with the IntercontinentalExchange to pursue a hostile $11 billion bid for NYSE Euronext, which has rebuffed the advance. The Big Board has been a popular destination for several prominent Internet I.P.O.’s this year. On Wednesday, Renren, a Chinese social networking company based in Beijing, made its debut on the exchange. The competition between the Nasdaq and the Big Board is expected to continue to heat up over the next two years, as more multibillion-dollar Web companies, including Groupon and Facebook, head to the public markets. Although technology companies typically list on the Nasdaq, which is seen as friendlier to smaller, growth companies because of its flexible listing requirements, Peter Falvey, a managing director at Morgan Keegan, said the Big Board offered branding value. “The N.Y.S.E. is often seen as on the side of bigger companies,” he said. But smaller companies might “get some benefit from saying, ‘We’re listed on the N.Y.S.E.,’ ” Mr. Falvey said. “It doesn’t get more blue chip than that.” A representative for LinkedIn declined to comment on Wednesday.

Duncan L. Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, said that his company’s limited response on Monday to Nasdaq and ICE’s announcement was because it contained little new information. “A lot of it was expected,” he told DealBook on the sidelines of the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2011 here. Mr. Niederauer said that the offer would be subject to a number of conditions, and that Nasdaq and ICE had merely indicated that they intended to begin soliciting NYSE Euronext shareholders sometime over the next month. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Video: Life and Death of the Trading Floor Nasdaq and ICE plan to file the details of their tender offer within the next two weeks, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Monday. The two companies announced their intention to file in hopes of luring shareholders who could be more favorable to their cause ahead of May 9, the cutoff by which investors must own shares in NYSE Euronext to vote in the July 7 special meeting. Mr. Niederauer said that in the meantime, his company and its preferred suitor, Deutsche Börse, were continuing to make progress in securing antitrust approval. NYSE Euronext has already received a second request for information from the Justice Department, an important step in the process. (Nasdaq and ICE said that they have also received a second request, in what they argued was a sign that their own antitrust efforts were proceeding quickly as well.) The NYSE Euronext chief said that it was unlikely that his company would receive antitrust approval by the July 7 meeting. But that has never been the goal. “Our job is to give as much clarity as possible,” he said. “All we’ve committed to is showing that we’re pretty far down the path with regulators.” In a panel at the Milken conference earlier in the day, Mr. Niederauer again defended the merits of NYSE Euronext’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse. The two exchange operators have argued that their plan, which would create a trans-Atlantic colossus with significant operations in the trading of stocks, options and derivatives. By contrast, Nasdaq and ICE would cleave NYSE Euronext into two. The former would combine the two biggest stock exchange operators in the United States, while the latter would form a newly enlarged giant in derivatives trading. But Mr. Niederauer said that the inexorable trend in all industries is becoming more international. NYSE Euronext has no choice but to become as diverse as clients like General Electric and the Coca-Cola Company. He reiterated that NYSE Euronext was working to end up with only a third or so of its business coming from the United States by the end of next year. “We think that’s exactly the right answer,” he said. “We can be as patriotic as we want to be, but that shouldn’t cloud how we feel about the capital markets. Capital isn’t patriotic.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/nasdaq-omx-and-ice-go-hostile-in-nyse-bid/?ref=nyseeuronext">Nasdaq OMX and ICE Go Hostile in NYSE Bid<date>May 2, 2011, 2:24 pm</date><text>Ramin Talaie/Bloomberg News The floor of the New York Stock Exchange 7:24 p.m. | Updated The Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange announced on Monday that they would take their $11 billion takeover offer for NYSE Euronext directly to the company’s shareholders. The move is intended to put additional pressure on NYSE Euronext, which has insisted on sticking by its preferred merger partner, Deutsche Börse, in a $10.3 billion deal. NYSE Euronext has twice rejected Nasdaq and ICE, arguing that their bid cannot survive antitrust review. The offer, now hostile, would split NYSE Euronext in two, combining the two biggest stock market operators in the United States and creating a derivatives giant. The company has also argued that a breakup would create a far less compelling opportunity than continuing to expand abroad and strengthen the number of services it provides. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The Nasdaq-ICE Statement Yet several NYSE Euronext shareholders have expressed displeasure with the company’s refusal to meet with Nasdaq and ICE, an act the investors say denies them the chance to vote on a higher-priced bid. In a sign of that ire, NYSE Euronext’s directors were re-elected by holders of about 80 percent of the company’s outstanding shares, a far lower number than is usual. Shareholders also approved of two governance proposals the board opposed, including one that would allow investors to call special meetings. Nasdaq and ICE have sought to play on that shareholder sentiment, offering NYSE Euronext incentives to at least come to the negotiating table. They include higher projected cost savings and a $350 million reverse breakup fee if their takeover bid runs aground in the antitrust review process. “The NYSE Euronext Board has continually challenged the seriousness of our proposal and refused to engage us in discussion despite the positive feedback we have received from their stockholders,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said Monday in a statement. “The commencement of this exchange offer should convince the NYSE Euronext Board of the seriousness of our intentions,” Mr. Greifeld said. The operator of the Big Board said in a statement that the Nasdaq-ICE bid remained the same as the offer it had already rejected. Deutsche Börse said Monday in a statement that it remained committed to the merger with NYSE Euronext. “The proposal by Nasdaq and ICE would burden shareholders with irresponsible leverage, eliminate a competitor and face insurmountable antitrust risk,” the statement added. The offer from Nasdaq and ICE is likely to carry several requirements, including its acceptance by a majority of NYSE Euronext shareholders. It would also require the Big Board owner’s directors to waive a provision in the company’s charter that limits any one shareholder or related parties to a 20 percent stake and a 10 percent voting stake. Nasdaq and ICE have said they will disclose the full details of the tender offer this month. Under the terms of the Nasdaq-ICE bid, NYSE Euronext shareholders would receive $14.24 in cash, 0.4069 of Nasdaq stock and 0.1436 of ICE stock. That is worth about $42.26 a share. But the premium of that bid has been shrinking in recent weeks amid a decline in the dollar and an increase in the value of Deutsche Börse’s stock. Under the terms of that proposal, NYSE Euronext shareholders would receive 0.47 in new Deutsche Börse stock for each of their shares. Shares of NYSE Euronext rose nearly 0.9 percent on Monday, to close at $40.40.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/nyse-euronext-gets-pressure-from-investors/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext Gets Pressure From Investors<date>April 28, 2011, 12:48 pm</date><text>NYSE Euronext sought on Thursday to mount a more vigorous defense of its planned merger with Deutsche Börse at its annual shareholder meeting.

Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links NYSE Euronext press release NYSE Euronext sought to blunt opposition to the deal with its latest quarterly results, which included a 26 percent rise in profit, to $177 million. “We’re not taking our eye off the ball,” Duncan L. Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, told the crowd of 100 or so shareholders and reporters gathered at the Big Board. “We’re executing successfully.” NYSE Euronext officials also offered an explanation for the additional 100 million euros in cost savings that were unveiled this week. Mr. Niederauer said that he had been conservative in negotiating the deal back in February, leaving out potential savings opportunities like settling on a common trading and clearing platform. That alone would yield 41 million euros in savings, he said. By the company’s analysis, he said, the combined and still-unnamed exchange operator would carry a stock price in the mid-$40s, assuming no improvement in its trading multiple. NYSE Euronext’s chairman, Jan-Michiel Hessels, added that the company still would not negotiate with Nasdaq and ICE because of “unacceptable execution risks,” namely antitrust concerns over combining the two big American stock exchange operators. He derided the bid as “an empty vessel.” But the anger that some shareholders felt over NYSE Euronext’s refusal to even negotiate with its unwanted suitors colored the meeting. Some investors voted against or withheld support for re-electing the company’s slate of directors, and shareholders passed two proposals the board had opposed: the ability to convene special meetings and to pass resolutions by written consent. “I believe this merger is grossly unfair to shareholders,” Kenneth Steiner, a shareholder who had proposed the special meetings proposal, said during the meeting. “I believe those directors should be removed.” All directors were re-elected, with Mr. Hessels saying they received more than 80 percent of votes cast. But the two proposals were also approved, a result that was expected, Mr. Hessels told reporters later. During much of the management presentation portion of the meeting, Mr. Niederauer spoke glowingly of the benefits of the Deutsche Börse transaction. He argued again that it would fill every gap in services that NYSE Euronext has. “We’re not dependent on one product anymore,” he said. “We’re not dependent on one area.” But shareholders seemed preoccupied with the price gap between the two bids. As of midday Thursday, the Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-stock bid was worth $42.56 a share, about 10.3 percent higher than Deutsche Börse all-stock proposal of $38.58 a share. (The gap has been shrinking over the past few weeks, and the German exchange’s positive earnings report on Thursday helped raise the value of its offer.) One shareholder, Jim Rothenberg of Complex Enterprises, recommended that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse raise the amount of stock that shareholders in the former company receive, to 0.5 shares from 0.47 shares. He also recommended that they begin a “Pac-Man” offense by making a takeover bid for ICE, which would create a derivatives powerhouse and distract the unbidden suitors. Another shareholder also recommended improving the stock exchange ratio, as well as paying a special dividend to Deutsche Börse investors to make the higher price palatable. Mr. Niederauer responded that the two companies have enough financial stability to consider modifying the deal — both exchanges expect no cut in dividends — and conceded that he had not considered a special dividend to Deutsche Börse shareholders. “We realized that between now and July 7 that we have the flexibility to consider all options,” he said, referring to the date of the shareholder vote on the deal. Mr. Niederauer added that his company and its German counterpart have been moving forward with their own antitrust process, including having met with more than 100 regulatory officials and having received a second request for information from the Justice Department. (Nasdaq and ICE have also received a second request.) He said that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse planned to take their final filing to European antitrust regulators by mid-June. Separately, Deutsche Börse’s chief executive, Reto Francioni, said during his company’s earnings call that the market operator would begin its stock tender offer next month and conclude it in early July.

The Singapore-Australia deal already has been called off. Some Canadian authorities consider the Toronto Stock Exchange operator TMX, awaiting approval of a deal with the London Stock Exchange, a strategic asset. Challenges still lie ahead for any NYSE Euronext deal, be it with Deutsche Börse or Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange. A worldwide veto would leave exchange bosses for whom the answer was consolidation struggling with the same tough questions. For starters, there’s size. A failure to merge would consign smaller bourses to the periphery. A standalone TMX, ASX in Australia or London bourse would have little if any scope to grow beyond its borders. And Singapore faces a difficult road winning business from rivals in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Then there’s cut-throat competition, especially in equities. Traditional exchanges have been losing market share to new trading venues for years. That reinforces the desire to get bigger. Even if scale doesn’t completely solve the problem, two or three years of earnings helped by merger-related savings can be appealing. It’s perhaps no coincidence that exchange combinations are back just as such benefits from earlier tie-ups are running out — and that the size of cost cuts is now central to the battle between NYSE Euronext’s two suitors. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, is making the contrarian call that United States equities will be a growth business. But if he and ICE’s Jeffrey Sprecher don’t manage to break up the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal, he will have no merger-related cost savings to fall back on and will therefore have to work harder to prove his point. NYSE and Deutsche Börse both have equities and derivatives operations in multiple countries even if they don’t get together. But the interlopers Nasdaq and ICE have mounted an effective campaign questioning the management and financial performance of the two would-be partners. The fallout, regardless of whether their deal is approved, could prove a distraction. ICE could wind up best off, or at least in no worse shape. It is already benefiting from fast-growing commodities and exchange markets, with earnings-per-share growth around double that of its exchange peers over the last few years. That’s not a silver lining others can look forward to if their mergers are defeated. Why Y-Shares? China likes financial experiments, but they don’t all end in success. The latest renminbi innovation may be one of them. Hong Kong’s introduction of stocks priced and paid for in the mainland currency, starting with real estate trust Hui Xian, recalls the forgotten “B-share” market, where foreigners could invest directly in mainland stocks. As investors get ready to consider renminbi-denominated shares, they should heed history. Stock markets in greater China already look like an alphabet soup. The majority of stocks are so-called A-shares, some 2,000 companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen in the Chinese currency. Then there are the B-shares, some 106 Chinese company stocks denominated in United States dollars and Hong Kong dollars. Since that market was started in 1992 there have also been H-shares, Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong. Now comes the new renminbi-denominated stocks — let’s call them Y-shares. While A- and H-shares have thrived, the B-share market has withered. There have been no new stocks introduced since 2000, and B-shares trade at an average 55 percent discount to their A-share equivalents. The main reason is a lack of liquidity. Y-shares look more like B than H. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong have grown to $62 billion, but are scant compared with Hong Kong dollars. A few big names may attract both investors and renminbi deposits. But big issuers will normally want their shares priced in the most liquid currency. Bankers say most candidates for the new Y-shares are unexciting mainland property trusts. If China opened its borders to capital flows, liquidity would increase dramatically. But for renminbi stocks in Hong Kong, that would create another problem. If foreigners get full access to mainland markets with a broader selection of companies, there will be little reason to buy renminbi stocks in Hong Kong. So whichever direction the country takes, Hong Kong’s Y-shares are unlikely to get very far.

It has strict governance rules for companies whose shares trade on its exchange. Even through years of weathering Enron and other corporate scandals, not to mention the outcry over the pay package for its own former chief executive, Richard A. Grasso, the exchange has marketed a Big Board listing as a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. So it has been somewhat surprising to watch the board of the exchange's parent company as it defends its planned merger with Deutsche Borse and fights off a rival bid from Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE. Without so much as having a brief meeting or discussion with Nasdaq and ICE on their bid - which offered over 13 percent more than Deutsche Borse's bid - the board of NYSE Euronext declared the offer ''clearly not in the best interests of our shareholders.'' How could the board determine that without even having a conversation? Rob Rutschow, an analyst at the Hong Kong-based CLSA brokerage firm, put it best: ''It is hard to ignore a much higher value per share offered by Nasdaq and ICE, but NYSE's management found a way to do it.'' Then, in the face of a proposal for shareholders to hold an extraordinary meeting to compel the NYSE Euronext board to consider the rival bid - a right that the shareholders don't have without the consent of the board - the directors turned them down. Corporate governance experts are dismayed. John Biggs, a director of Boeing and the former chief of TIAA-CREF who now teaches corporate governance at New York University, says that given the Big Board's role as a model for others, it is indefensible for the company not to engage in merger talks. ''Why is the NYSE taking this position and being unwilling to talk? On the face of it, 'best practice' would be to have a meeting,'' he said. ''There may be reasons not to talk - but I haven't heard them.'' In truth, the NYSE has articulated a series of reasons it prefers its deal with Deutsche Borse, all of which seem somewhat reasonable. Its biggest reason is that a deal with Nasdaq and ICE, it says, faces enormous regulatory challenges and is complicated by the fact that NYSE would be split up by the buyers, which is, of course, accurate. But that doesn't mean that the board of NYSE shouldn't be meeting with potential buyers in hopes of squeezing an even better offer from them. And it seems even stranger to see the board prevent its own shareholders from considering the offer, given its propensity toward pushing companies on the exchange to be more open. Here's the NYSE, in its own words, when it comes to listed companies: ''Good business practice is frequently the controlling factor in the determination of management to submit a matter to shareholders for approval even though neither the law nor the company's charter makes such approvals necessary. The exchange encourages this growth in corporate democracy.'' And yet, when it comes to its own shareholder democracy, well, the NYSE is not as quick to take its own advice. The NYSE's reason for not having a special meeting? ''A 10 percent standard for calling special meetings as favored by the proponent would present a real risk of significant cost, management distraction and diversion of management and financial resources to address a possibly unlimited number of special meetings.'' Really? That's the rationale? It's not as if the company is being bid on every day. Institutional Shareholder Services, the proxy advisory service, wrote: ''The inability to call a special meeting and the resulting insulation of management could adversely affect corporate performance and shareholder returns.'' In fairness, people close to the NYSE say the bid by Nasdaq is so inadequate - the price is too low and the antitrust challenges so high with little in the way of protection for its shareholders should a deal fail to get done - that it would be a disservice to NYSE's shareholder's to engage in any form of talks. If the bid were higher or included some greater sense of certainty, it would at least be worth the conversation. And some have cynically suggested that Nasdaq and ICE are not really interested in a deal with the NYSE. The bid, they say, is just an effort to force Deutsche Borse to pay more or an opportunity for Nasdaq to get a peek at its biggest rival's confidential numbers. Invoking an old Wall Street saw, one executive working for NYSE described Nasdaq's bid as ''a chance to see the centerfold without having to pay for the magazine.'' All that may be true - and the offer from Deutche Borse may ultimately be the better deal - but for a company that is supposed to be the example to every other, the right ''process'' may be as important as the outcome. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTOS: Duncan Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext.

The increase might allow the German exchange to sweeten its offer to help fend off a higher joint bid from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange. But it also suggests the NYSE and its partner grossly underestimated their aggressive rivals — and perhaps other salient challenges.In isolation, there is nothing wrong with revising the synergies companies expect to squeeze from a deal. Wary of the fallout from overpromising and underdelivering, plenty of companies agreeing to merge initially offer conservative estimates for removing overlapping operations and staff. But such added juice usually shows up only after deals close. The NYSE and Deutsche Börse managed to find a sizable one-third more in promised cost cuts just weeks after announcing a merger they apparently spent months working on — and for which they employed no fewer than eight high-price investment banks. That adds to the impression the two were unprepared for the advances of the Nasdaq and ICE, and are scrambling to react. The Big Board’s chief executive, Duncan Niederauer, has already publicly conceded that Deutsche Börse’s boss, Reto Francioni, has not done the best job winning over NYSE shareholders. Granted, the increased savings are still good news for fans of the trans-Atlantic tie-up. Once taxed, discounted and capitalized these could provide the German bourse with the wiggle room to add an extra $1 billion to its offer, significantly closing the gap to Nasdaq/ICE’s offer. But as Nasdaq/ICE is fond of pointing out, synergies from the NYSE-Euronext merger weren’t as forthcoming as promised. And NYSE’s ability to suddenly find so much more fat to trim adds weight to the aspersions the interlopers are casting about the two wannabe partners’ management and cost-cutting skills. More worrying for NYSE/Deutsche Börse is whether their complacency about the likelihood of a counteroffer extends to antitrust issues. If United States and European regulators don’t share their views about increased concentration on securities exchanges, it could prove fatal for their deal. Trade That Glitters Barrick Gold has taken a shine to copper. The Canadian mining company jumped on Monday into the battle for Equinox, with a $7.7 billion bid that trumps one from China’s Minmetals. It is a rich offer for a copper miner from a company that mainly promotes its gold credentials. Barrick’s shift as the prices of both metals soar may not be the best use of resources. It was gold that helped make 2010 Barrick’s most profitable year in its 27-year history. That followed heavily trumpeted efforts in the second half of 2009 to position the company as a bigger wager on the yellow metal. It was then the gold producer tapped shareholders for $3 billion to remove its hedges, including by paying off fixed price contracts. But copper has been on an even bigger tear. The price of gold has approximately doubled over the last two years as investors fret over inflation, political turmoil, currency risks and sovereign debt. Copper, meanwhile, has become a proxy investment on industrializing China and India, leading the price to roughly triple over the same span. Barrick sees more room for copper to run. Buying Equinox would double its production of the metal and its percentage of nongold revenue to a fifth. The 30 percent premium Barrick is offering Equinox shareholders looks justifiable only if the market is “understating” copper assumptions as much as Barrick’s boss, Aaron Regent, says it is. The companies don’t claim any cost savings from uniting. And Equinox already has enjoyed the full spoils of the metal’s boom, with the company’s shares keeping pace with the rise in copper prices. To overtake the rival Equinox bid, Barrick is offering a rich valuation compared with other recent mining deals of 7.1 times Ebitda. Minmetals could yet come back with an even higher price, which Barrick can match. With gold at historically high prices, Barrick may be feeling flush. But copper prices are also at a peak. Barrick shareholders kicked in a year-and-a-half ago when the company wanted to become a purer play on gold. Returning that cash would have let them decide for themselves whether they were ready to change the bet.

He has dismissed the 219-year-old capitalist symbol of the New York exchange as “a stage prop” that ought to be taken apart “board by board.” Now, though, with Nasdaq and the Intercontinental-Exchange in a fierce fight with the Deutsche Börse to buy the Big Board, and its parent company, NYSE Euronext, Mr. Greifeld insists that he will not only keep the floor open but reverse its long decline. Although it might seem largely symbolic — only about 1,200 traders remain on the floor, down from more than 2,500 a decade and a half ago — both bidders are promising to keep it open, a rare point of agreement and a nod to the high-stakes public relations battle now under way. Behind the scenes, however, starkly different strategic visions of the future of stock exchanges are being proposed. The tussle between the exchanges is a question about which model is going to compete most successfully in a global marketplace: one that straddles continents and product lines or one that stays local and focused. “The question is, what is the exchange of the future?” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, an investment banking and brokerage firm. “Both want to compete globally but Nasdaq is saying, hey, we think the best way to compete globally is to stay as narrowly focused as possible. NYSE is saying, hey, you need to be diversified to compete and have global capabilities.” The strategy of the Deutsche Börse calls for the combined company to trade stocks as well as higher-margin, faster-growing derivatives in both Europe and the United States. “It is a bigger international play,” said Patrick J. Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group. Nasdaq’s vision is built on dominating stock trading in the United States. It would have some international equity trading, like its current OMX operations in the Nordic and Baltic countries, as well NYSE Euronext exchanges in European centers like Paris and Amsterdam. But the merger would make the combined business the home of all the companies listed in the United States, responsible for 45 percent to 50 percent of domestic trading volume. Issuers, including overseas companies, might prefer a bigger, unified American capital market compared with the fragmented one now. On Thursday the fate of the Big Board is likely to take center stage at the annual shareholder meeting of NYSE Euronext in Manhattan. But the final outcome may be decided only by a shareholder vote scheduled for July. The deal with the Deutsche Börse — which went mainly electronic more than a decade ago and has only about 120 traders on its floor in Frankfurt — would give NYSE Euronext a much bigger share of the market for exchange-based derivatives trading in Europe, including interest rate derivatives as well as NYSE Euronext’s 27 percent share of cash stock market trading in the United States. Under the Nasdaq-ICE bid, NYSE Euronext would be split into two. The NYSE Euronext’s stock-trading operations, including the NYSE floor, would go to Nasdaq, while ICE would pick up most of the derivatives businesses in the United States and Europe. NYSE’s board has twice rebuffed the Nasdaq-ICE bid, even though Mr. Greifeld sweetened his offer last week with firmer bank financing and an offer to pay a $350 million break-up fee to NYSE Euronext if regulators veto the deal. The NYSE Euronext board said it still prefers to merge with the Deutsche Börse, because that deal would keep the company intact, and emphasize the global cross-product strategy, while they argue an Nasdaq-ICE combination would run afoul of antitrust rules. The Nasdaq-ICE bid is also a bet on the superiority of purely electronic trading. From its headquarters in Times Square, Nasdaq has done more than anyone else to draw business away and diminish the exchange, and in the shift to electronic trading the Big Board itself adopted ever more automation and set up its own electronic-only market, called Arca. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/live-from-the-nyse-shareholders-meeting/?ref=nyseeuronext">Live From the NYSE Shareholders Meeting<date>April 28, 2011, 8:11 am</date><text>NYSE Euronext, whose merger deal with the Deutsche Börse faces a challenge from a joint bid by the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, is holding a shareholders meeting.

The increase might allow the German exchange to sweeten its offer to help fend off a higher joint bid from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange. But it also suggests the NYSE and its partner grossly underestimated their aggressive rivals — and perhaps other salient challenges.In isolation, there is nothing wrong with revising the synergies companies expect to squeeze from a deal. Wary of the fallout from overpromising and underdelivering, plenty of companies agreeing to merge initially offer conservative estimates for removing overlapping operations and staff. But such added juice usually shows up only after deals close. The NYSE and Deutsche Börse managed to find a sizable one-third more in promised cost cuts just weeks after announcing a merger they apparently spent months working on — and for which they employed no fewer than eight high-price investment banks. That adds to the impression the two were unprepared for the advances of the Nasdaq and ICE, and are scrambling to react. The Big Board’s chief executive, Duncan Niederauer, has already publicly conceded that Deutsche Börse’s boss, Reto Francioni, has not done the best job winning over NYSE shareholders. Granted, the increased savings are still good news for fans of the trans-Atlantic tie-up. Once taxed, discounted and capitalized these could provide the German bourse with the wiggle room to add an extra $1 billion to its offer, significantly closing the gap to Nasdaq/ICE’s offer. But as Nasdaq/ICE is fond of pointing out, synergies from the NYSE-Euronext merger weren’t as forthcoming as promised. And NYSE’s ability to suddenly find so much more fat to trim adds weight to the aspersions the interlopers are casting about the two wannabe partners’ management and cost-cutting skills. More worrying for NYSE/Deutsche Börse is whether their complacency about the likelihood of a counteroffer extends to antitrust issues. If United States and European regulators don’t share their views about increased concentration on securities exchanges, it could prove fatal for their deal. Trade That Glitters Barrick Gold has taken a shine to copper. The Canadian mining company jumped on Monday into the battle for Equinox, with a $7.7 billion bid that trumps one from China’s Minmetals. It is a rich offer for a copper miner from a company that mainly promotes its gold credentials. Barrick’s shift as the prices of both metals soar may not be the best use of resources. It was gold that helped make 2010 Barrick’s most profitable year in its 27-year history. That followed heavily trumpeted efforts in the second half of 2009 to position the company as a bigger wager on the yellow metal. It was then the gold producer tapped shareholders for $3 billion to remove its hedges, including by paying off fixed price contracts. But copper has been on an even bigger tear. The price of gold has approximately doubled over the last two years as investors fret over inflation, political turmoil, currency risks and sovereign debt. Copper, meanwhile, has become a proxy investment on industrializing China and India, leading the price to roughly triple over the same span. Barrick sees more room for copper to run. Buying Equinox would double its production of the metal and its percentage of nongold revenue to a fifth. The 30 percent premium Barrick is offering Equinox shareholders looks justifiable only if the market is “understating” copper assumptions as much as Barrick’s boss, Aaron Regent, says it is. The companies don’t claim any cost savings from uniting. And Equinox already has enjoyed the full spoils of the metal’s boom, with the company’s shares keeping pace with the rise in copper prices. To overtake the rival Equinox bid, Barrick is offering a rich valuation compared with other recent mining deals of 7.1 times Ebitda. Minmetals could yet come back with an even higher price, which Barrick can match. With gold at historically high prices, Barrick may be feeling flush. But copper prices are also at a peak. Barrick shareholders kicked in a year-and-a-half ago when the company wanted to become a purer play on gold. Returning that cash would have let them decide for themselves whether they were ready to change the bet.

He has dismissed the 219-year-old capitalist symbol of the New York exchange as “a stage prop” that ought to be taken apart “board by board.” Now, though, with Nasdaq and the Intercontinental-Exchange in a fierce fight with the Deutsche Börse to buy the Big Board, and its parent company, NYSE Euronext, Mr. Greifeld insists that he will not only keep the floor open but reverse its long decline. Although it might seem largely symbolic — only about 1,200 traders remain on the floor, down from more than 2,500 a decade and a half ago — both bidders are promising to keep it open, a rare point of agreement and a nod to the high-stakes public relations battle now under way. Behind the scenes, however, starkly different strategic visions of the future of stock exchanges are being proposed. The tussle between the exchanges is a question about which model is going to compete most successfully in a global marketplace: one that straddles continents and product lines or one that stays local and focused. “The question is, what is the exchange of the future?” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, an investment banking and brokerage firm. “Both want to compete globally but Nasdaq is saying, hey, we think the best way to compete globally is to stay as narrowly focused as possible. NYSE is saying, hey, you need to be diversified to compete and have global capabilities.” The strategy of the Deutsche Börse calls for the combined company to trade stocks as well as higher-margin, faster-growing derivatives in both Europe and the United States. “It is a bigger international play,” said Patrick J. Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group. Nasdaq’s vision is built on dominating stock trading in the United States. It would have some international equity trading, like its current OMX operations in the Nordic and Baltic countries, as well NYSE Euronext exchanges in European centers like Paris and Amsterdam. But the merger would make the combined business the home of all the companies listed in the United States, responsible for 45 percent to 50 percent of domestic trading volume. Issuers, including overseas companies, might prefer a bigger, unified American capital market compared with the fragmented one now. On Thursday the fate of the Big Board is likely to take center stage at the annual shareholder meeting of NYSE Euronext in Manhattan. But the final outcome may be decided only by a shareholder vote scheduled for July. The deal with the Deutsche Börse — which went mainly electronic more than a decade ago and has only about 120 traders on its floor in Frankfurt — would give NYSE Euronext a much bigger share of the market for exchange-based derivatives trading in Europe, including interest rate derivatives as well as NYSE Euronext’s 27 percent share of cash stock market trading in the United States. Under the Nasdaq-ICE bid, NYSE Euronext would be split into two. The NYSE Euronext’s stock-trading operations, including the NYSE floor, would go to Nasdaq, while ICE would pick up most of the derivatives businesses in the United States and Europe. NYSE’s board has twice rebuffed the Nasdaq-ICE bid, even though Mr. Greifeld sweetened his offer last week with firmer bank financing and an offer to pay a $350 million break-up fee to NYSE Euronext if regulators veto the deal. The NYSE Euronext board said it still prefers to merge with the Deutsche Börse, because that deal would keep the company intact, and emphasize the global cross-product strategy, while they argue an Nasdaq-ICE combination would run afoul of antitrust rules. The Nasdaq-ICE bid is also a bet on the superiority of purely electronic trading. From its headquarters in Times Square, Nasdaq has done more than anyone else to draw business away and diminish the exchange, and in the shift to electronic trading the Big Board itself adopted ever more automation and set up its own electronic-only market, called Arca. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/nyse-euronext-a-fight-about-cost-savings/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext: A Fight About Cost Savings<date>April 25, 2011, 2:35 pm</date><text>5:49 p.m. | Updated The battle over NYSE Euronext may come down in part to a question of who can save more in a deal with the Big Board. NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, Duncan Niederauer, told The Financial Times that his company had essentially understated the amount of cost savings in its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse by about 100 million euros. That puts the figure at “closer to” 400 million euros, or about $583 million. In his interview, Mr. Niederauer said that the savings would come in part from combining NYSE Euronext’s derivatives clearing platform with Deutsche Börse’s, allowing customers to pay just once. Hinted at for some time, the revised numbers are meant to push back against the more than $700 million in cost savings estimated by the Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange in their proposed takeover of NYSE Euronext. That’s in part because there’s more overlap in the Nasdaq-ICE proposal, especially in combining Nasdaq with NYSE Euronext’s stock-trading business, which would be a merger of the nation’s two biggest stock market operators. Unsurprisingly, Nasdaq and ICE are skeptical about NYSE Euronext’s new numbers. In a statement on Monday, they question how, after more than two years of due diligence, NYSE Euronext was suddenly able to find an additional 100 million euros of cost savings. They also questioned where the additional savings come from, since the combined NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse plan to maintain two headquarters and two technology platforms. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Nasdaq-ICE press release In a separate presentation (below), Nasdaq and ICE highlighted what they said were flaws in NYSE Euronext’s own merger history, including missing both expense reduction and revenue combination targets in the original combination of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext. They also pointed to a $1.6 billion write-down that NYSE Euronext took in late 2008 to reflect the lower value of the merger. Nasdaq’s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, has said that his mooted cost savings would come in large part from combining data centers and backoffice systems. But NYSE Euronext has fought back by saying that its merger with Deutsche Börse would create minimal job cuts in the United States, whereas the Nasdaq offer’s cost savings are built on widespread pink slips. That argument appears to have gotten the ear of Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. In a letter to the chief executives of Nasdaq and ICE, Mr. Schumer demanded more information about what their deal would mean for New York City jobs. According to estimates prepared for him by NYSE Euronext, the Nasdaq-ICE proposal would lead to more than 1,000 job cuts in the United States — and 800 in New York City. Update: Nasdaq disclosed on Monday that it has received a “second request” for information by the Justice Department as part of the antitrust approval process. Nasdaq and ICE officials argue privately that the speed at which it appears to be making progress helps out their case, since it removes some of the uncertainty about when the two companies will get a yay or nay on their NYSE Euronext bid. Here’s the full text of the letter that Mr. Schumer sent to Nasdaq and ICE: Robert Greifeld Chief Executive Officer &amp; President The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc One Liberty Plaza 165 Broadway New York, NY 10006 Jeffrey Sprecher Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. 2100 RiverEdge Parkway Suite 500 Atlanta, GA 30328 Dear Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Sprecher, I write you today regarding an area of critical importance to me with respect to your ongoing efforts to acquire NYSE Euronext. As we previously discussed, I am concerned with the potential impact a NASDAQ/ICE takeover of NYSE Euronext would have on jobs in and around New York City. This would be a major consideration in judging any potential transaction. I understand that the NYSE Euronext board of directors has once again reaffirmed its support for the Deutsche Börse transaction, but I also understand that NASDAQ and ICE may further revise their proposal or take it directly to NYSE Euronext’s stockholders. Accordingly, I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation, during which I requested your best estimates of expected job losses in the New York City area that would result from a NASDAQ/ICE takeover of NYSE Euronext. By your own account, the business rationale for a NASDAQ/ICE transaction appears predicated largely on over $700 million in so-called “cost synergies”. That almost certainly means significant job losses. At my request, NYSE Euronext estimated that the NASDAQ/ICE proposal, if effectuated, would result in the loss of 1,000-1,100 U.S. jobs, including approximately 800 in the New York City area. Prior to taking additional steps in your acquisition efforts, please provide me with your best estimate of how many jobs would be lost in the New York City area in the event of a NASDAQ/NYSE combination, and an explanation for how the claimed cost synergies would be achieved in light of your estimated level of job losses. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. Sincerely, Charles E.

The New York Stock Exchange, that bastion and soundstage of capitalism, has always held itself up as a model of good corporate governance. It has strict governance rules for companies whose shares trade on its exchange. Even through years of weathering Enron and other corporate scandals, not to mention the outcry over the pay package for its own former chief executive, Richard A. Grasso, the exchange has marketed a Big Board listing as a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. So it has been somewhat surprising to watch the board of the exchange’s parent company as it defends its planned merger with Deutsche Börse and fights off a rival bid from the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE. Without so much as having a brief meeting or discussion with Nasdaq and ICE on their bid — which offered over 13 percent more than Deutsche Börse’s bid — the board of NYSE Euronext declared the offer “clearly not in the best interests of our shareholders.” How could the board determine that without even having a conversation? DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: A Fight About Cost Savings Video: Life and Death of the Trading Floor Rob Rutschow, an analyst at the Hong Kong-based CLSA brokerage firm, put it best: “It is hard to ignore a much higher value per share offered by Nasdaq and ICE, but NYSE’s management found a way to do it.” Then, in the face of a proposal for shareholders to hold an extraordinary meeting to compel the NYSE Euronext board to consider the rival bid — a right that the shareholders don’t have without the consent of the board — the directors turned them down. Corporate governance experts are dismayed. John Biggs, a director of Boeing and the former chief of TIAA-CREF who now teaches corporate governance at New York University, says that given the Big Board’s role as a model for others, it is indefensible for the company not to engage in merger talks. “Why is the NYSE taking this position and being unwilling to talk? On the face of it, ‘best practice’ would be to have a meeting,” he said. “There may be reasons not to talk — but I haven’t heard them.” In truth, the NYSE has articulated a series of reasons it prefers its deal with Deutsche Börse, all of which seem somewhat reasonable. Its biggest reason is that a deal with Nasdaq and ICE, it says, faces enormous regulatory challenges and is complicated by the fact that NYSE would be split up by the buyers, which is, of course, accurate. But that doesn’t mean that the board of NYSE shouldn’t be meeting with potential buyers in hopes of squeezing an even better offer from them. And it seems even stranger to see the board prevent its own shareholders from considering the offer, given its propensity toward pushing companies on the exchange to be more open. Here’s the NYSE, in its own words, when it comes to listed companies: “Good business practice is frequently the controlling factor in the determination of management to submit a matter to shareholders for approval even though neither the law nor the company’s charter makes such approvals necessary. The exchange encourages this growth in corporate democracy.” And yet, when it comes to its own shareholder democracy, well, the NYSE is not as quick to take its own advice. The NYSE’s reason for not having a special meeting? “A 10 percent standard for calling special meetings as favored by the proponent would present a real risk of significant cost, management distraction and diversion of management and financial resources to address a possibly unlimited number of special meetings.” Really? That’s the rationale? It’s not as if the company is being bid on every day. Institutional Shareholder Services, the proxy advisory service, wrote: “The inability to call a special meeting and the resulting insulation of management could adversely affect corporate performance and shareholder returns.” In fairness, people close to the NYSE say the bid by Nasdaq is so inadequate — the price is too low and the antitrust challenges so high with little in the way of protection for its shareholders should a deal fail to get done — that it would be a disservice to NYSE shareholder’s to engage in any form of talks. If the bid were higher or included some greater sense of certainty, it would at least be worth the conversation. And some have cynically suggested that Nasdaq and ICE are not really interested in a deal with the NYSE. The bid, they say, is just an effort to force Deutsche Börse to pay more or an opportunity for Nasdaq to get a peek at its biggest rival’s confidential numbers. Invoking an old Wall Street saw, one executive working for NYSE described Nasdaq’s bid as “a chance to see the centerfold without having to pay for the magazine.” All that may be true — and the offer from Deutche Börse may ultimately be the better deal — but for a company that is supposed to be the example to every other, the right “process” may be as important as the outcome.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/nyse-euronext-again-rejects-nasdaq-ice-bid/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext Again Rejects Nasdaq-ICE Bid<date>April 21, 2011, 11:02 am</date><text>Joshua Lott/Reuters Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext’s chairman, sees “unacceptable execution risk” in Nasdaq’s bid. 8:34 p.m. | Updated NYSE Euronext on Thursday dug itself in for a fight against the Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange, again rejecting its rivals’ $11.2 billion unsolicited bid in favor of a merger with Deutsche Börse. The decision by the operator of the Big Board heralds a potentially bruising fight, with Nasdaq and ICE hinting this week that they may eventually take their offer directly to NYSE Euronext shareholders if the company’s board refuses to come to the negotiating table. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said during his company’s earnings call with analysts on Wednesday that he would pursue an NYSE Euronext takeover until next April if necessary. NYSE Euronext’s directors made it clear that they had no intention of engaging with its unwanted suitors. In a terse announcement, issued after a board meeting on Thursday morning, the company said that despite new details announced this week, the Nasdaq-ICE offer remained unattractive. Those new elements included a $350 million breakup fee payable to NYSE Euronext if the Nasdaq-ICE deal failed to win antitrust approval and reimbursement for the roughly $364 million the Big Board operator would owe Deutsche Börse if their deal collapsed. Nasdaq and ICE also said that they had received commitments from their lenders for more than $3.8 billion in financing. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links NYSE Euronext press release Deal Professor: Weighing the Lesser of 2 Evils Deal Professor: Delaware Law Gives NYSE an Edge At Thursday’s closing prices, the Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-stock bid was worth about $42.99 a share, a 14.1 percent premium to the Deutsche Börse’s all-stock proposal, now worth about $37.68. But NYSE Euronext argued that the unsolicited bid would most likely succumb to antitrust concerns, and that its preferred merger was a better path forward. “Our view has not changed,” Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext’s chairman, said in a statement. “This proposal does not provide compelling value, has unacceptable execution risk and is therefore not in the best interests of NYSE Euronext shareholders.” Now NYSE Euronext must continue to convince those same shareholders that the Deutsche Börse deal will provide more benefits down the road. The two companies have said that combining to create a new international exchange operator, with big market share in stock, options and derivatives trading, is better than cleaving NYSE Euronext in two. By contrast, Nasdaq and ICE derided that plan this week as creating a messy “financial supermarket” that would diminish the performance of businesses like cash equities trading. Their proposal, they argue, would create two focused, well-run companies. In a statement issued hours after NYSE Euronext’s announcement, Nasdaq and ICE again urged the company to begin holding talks. They pointed to a clause in the Deutsche Börse merger agreement that permitted NYSE Euronext to allow other bidders to conduct due diligence if “there is a reasonable likelihood that such a proposal could constitute a superior proposal.” Nasdaq and ICE also agreed to let NYSE examine their books. For its part, Deutsche Börse criticized the competing bid in a statement as “seriously lacking in business logic” and a step backward compared with other proposed exchange mergers. The German company also dismissed the Nasdaq-ICE breakup fee as “illusory,” arguing that the requirements for actually paying out the $350 million were unreasonably high. Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, is expected to offer yet more detail about the Deutsche Börse merger at the company’s annual meeting next Thursday, a presentation that may include revised cost savings estimates. But he will most likely face tough questions from investors unhappy with the refusal to meet with Nasdaq and ICE, or to win more concessions from its German suitor. Shares in NYSE Euronext fell slightly on Thursday, to $39.03.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/delaware-law-gives-nyse-an-edge-in-battle-with-nasdaq/?ref=nyseeuronext">Delaware Law Gives NYSE an Edge in Battle With Nasdaq<date>April 21, 2011, 12:16 pm</date><text>In Wednesday’s Deal Professor column about the Nasdaq OMX-IntercontinentalExchange bid for NYSE Euronext, I discussed the antitrust risk of a Nasdaq/NYSE tie-up and the countervailing national interest, if any, in preventing a combination of NYSE and Deutsche Börse. Following up on that column, I want to highlight how the law provides a significant advantage to NYSE as long as it prefers a combination with Deutsche Börse. NYSE is a Delaware incorporated company, and so Delaware law governs the NYSE board’s decision to spurn Nasdaq — as it did again on Thursday — and agree to a combination with Deutsche Börse. Delaware law firmly supports the NYSE’s decision. Under a 1985 Delaware decision issued with respect to Ronald Perleman’s hostile bid for Revlon, a company is not required to put itself up for sale to the highest bidder unless there is a change of control or breakup of the company. This requirement is typically called Revlon duties after this case. A board that has decided to sell the company is known to be in Revlon-land. The issue in NYSE/Deutsche Börse combination is whether NYSE is undergoing a change of control. If Revlon applied, then the NYSE would be required to sell itself at the highest price reasonably available. The Nasdaq bid is about 14 percent higher than Deutsche Börse’s offer, so the only grounds left to NYSE would be to argue that the Nasdaq bid was incapable of clearing antitrust review and thus was not reasonably available. You can see that the NYSE is forcefully sticking to this argument in its most recent rejection of Nasdaq’s bid on Thursday. NYSE stated that the proposal has “unacceptable execution risk”. The NYSE would thus still have room to reject the Nasdaq bid if Revlon applied, but it would be much more limited and Nasdaq would have grounds to litigate to force NYSE to accept its bid. Under black-letter Delaware law, however, it appears that Revlon does not apply. The reason lies in another case involving a hostile bid, this one for Time by Paramount, and a 1989 Delaware Supreme Court decision, Paramount Communications v. Time. In 1989, Time agreed to merge with Warner in a stock-for-stock combination. When Paramount made a hostile bid for Time, the Time and Warner boards voted to restructure the transaction into a cash acquisition of Warner by Time. The restructuring avoided a Time shareholder vote on the Warner combination, something the Time board would have likely lost. The Delaware Supreme Court upheld the maneuver. The Delaware Supreme Court held that the initial stock-for-stock combination was not subject to Revlon duties because, among other things, Time had not “abandon[ed] its long-term strategy.” The Time board’s decision to enter into the combination was a strategic one and therefore there was no requirement to seek the highest price reasonably available. The Delaware Supreme Court refined this holding in the 1994 case of Paramount v. QVC, the Delaware case arising from the bidding war between Viacom and QVC over Paramount. In that case, the Delaware Supreme Court reasoned that Revlon duties did not attach if after the transaction “control of the corporation is not vested in a single person, entity, or group, but vested in the fluid aggregation of unaffiliated stockholders.” The justification was that in such a circumstance shareholders still maintained a continuing interest in the enterprise and the possibility of receiving a control premium. In Paramount v. QVC, the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon duties did apply even though the Viacom acquisition of QVC was a stock-for-stock merger because Sumner Redstone would be a majority holder of the combined company. There would be a change of control. Since that time, stock-for stock-transactions like NYSE/Deutsche Börse have generally not been subject to Revlon duties. And target boards have been required to follow Revlon when they agree to sell the company for cash. Some (including this author in his book “Gods at War”) have complained that this distinction is inapt. First, lawyers can simply structure transactions so as to avoid Revlon-land. The method is easy: arrange to have the acquirer pay with stock instead of cash. JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of Bear Stearns was structured in such a manner, for example, to avoid the almost nonexistent possibility of a competing bidder. Second, in some circumstances, this is effectively a change of control even if the transaction is all stock. An example would be if General Electric were acquiring a company with a $100 million market value for stock. No one could plausibly argue that G.E. wasn’t the acquirer here. Prior Delaware cases appear to imply that Revlon duties would still be inapplicable. Revlon is thus formalistic, and in application often does not pick up an acquisition because it is labeled and structured as a strategic one. Pay attention to the words that the NYSE Euronext chief executive, Duncan Niederauer, uses in describing the Deutsche Börse combination. It is all about strategic value. Mr. Niederauer effectively asserts that the combination of the two entities is a considered decision by the NYSE board based on implementing NYSE’s strategic plan. This talk may or may not be correct, but it is pitched to avoid pushing the NYSE into Revlon-land. Again this was reflected in the NYSE’s rejection Thursday morning when it spoke of the NYSE/Deutsche Börse transaction as positioning the combined “company to shape and capitalize on the industry’s evolution and global development.” Until recently, Delaware courts have been wholly unreceptive to arguments trying to expand application of Revlon to stock-for-stock transactions. However, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster in a recent opinion involving litigation over the Occam Networks acquisition implied that Revlon might apply if the company was significantly smaller than the acquirer even in a stock-for-stock transaction. It is unclear whether Vice Chancellor Laster will further rethink this doctrine beyond this narrow point. Even if he did, it is highly unlikely the Delaware Supreme Court, which would review Laster’s decision, would agree with his thinking. And the current shareholders litigation against the NYSE is before Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr., who has never expressed any discomfort with the Delaware decisions. It thus does not appear that Revlon is going to be rethought by the Delaware courts to apply to the NYSE/Deutsche Börse transaction. But even under current case-law, there is a thread of an argument that the Revlon doctrine should apply to the NYSE/Deutsche Börse transaction. The reason is that the combined NYSE/Deutsche Börse will be incorporated in the Netherlands. In acquisitions involving foreign reincorporations, there is a tendency for “flowback.” American shareholders will sell their shares simply because they do not want to own shares of a foreign company. Shares will flow back to the foreign exchange. NYSE and Deutsche Börse are trying to stem that by having the yet-to-be-named Deutsche Börse/NYSE combined entity use a global share instead of American depository shares. This mechanism was used by Daimler and Chrysler, although it failed to stem flowback in that case and by 2003 only about 5 percent of the trading volume of Daimler-Chrysler was in the United States. In these circumstances, flowback may still be significant because some of the NYSE’s institutional shareholders will have investing charters that do not permit them to own a foreign company. The number is not known but, according to Capital IQ, 71.5 percent of NYSE’s shareholders are institutional shareholders. While this is unlikely to be a majority of shareholders, it may be significant. We just don’t know. The American ownership of the combined entity will likely still remain substantial even if flowback occurs. This is because Deutsche Börse already has about 40 percent American ownership. Again, though, we don’t know for sure. The question is whether such a fundamental change in the siting of the company will significantly alter the scope of its shareholdings. In other words, perhaps the Revlon analysis should be about whether a company’s constitution will change so fundamentally that shareholders will no longer wish to or can own its shares.

The comments came as Nasdaq OMX reported a 70 percent rise in first-quarter earnings, offering a rejoinder to the fears that the takeover was too expensive and would weigh down its operations. The company earned $104 million, or 57 cents a share, up from $61 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Revenue, excluding rebates and fees, rose 15 percent, to $415 million. Robert Greifeld, the chief executive, said that among the quarter’s highlights was the strong performance of Nasdaq’s core cash equities trading unit. Mr. Greifeld said the business — characterized by some analysts as commoditized and lower margin — had been outperforming the flashier derivatives trading franchises of some competitors. Nasdaq has argued that the takeover, which would give it NYSE Euronext’s stock-trading business and give ICE the derivatives operations, would create two strong, concentrated companies. By contrast, it has said, a merger with Deutsche Börse would create a muddled “financial supermarket.” Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Nasdaq press release Deal Professor: Weighing the Lesser of 2 Evils Yet on Nasdaq’s investor call, analysts seemed more preoccupied with the latest specifics of the company’s NYSE Euronext bid, prompting Mr. Greifeld to joke that the good news was being obscured. “The first thing I have to say, Howard, is I thought you would ask about the quarter,” he told Howard Chen of Credit Suisse. All the same, Mr. Greifeld was happy to give some details on the bid. He said that Nasdaq and ICE had been providing the Justice Department “reams of data” to expedite antitrust approval. The company intends to begin the process in the near term. Nasdaq officials argued that their main task was to show the Justice Department that combining the two biggest American stock exchanges would not create a monopoly. Mr. Greifeld again pressed the argument that the Securities and Exchange Commission would prevent a combined Nasdaq-NYSE Euronext from gouging customers on listings fees. “The D.O.J. has to understand that we’re highly regulated,” he said. “What’s that mean? It’s really akin to the regulatory environment of a utility.” The rise of listings in other areas may also help Nasdaq’s argument, Mr. Greifeld said, noting that on one day when company officials were meeting with Justice Department staff members, Glencore International, the Swiss-based commodities producer and trader, formally announced that it would go public in a $12 billion offering in London and Hong Kong. “That was helpful,” he dryly noted. Mr. Greifeld also reiterated that Nasdaq was committed to pursuing NYSE Euronext for the long term, or at least through next April. The company’s lenders have committed to providing the financing for a year. Ronald Hassen, Nasdaq’s interim chief financial officer, said that while the exact terms of the loans depended on market conditions, the interest rate was expected to be about 2 to 2.25 percent above the London interbank offered rate. “We’re obviously happy with that rate,” Mr. Greifeld said. He added that while he was still optimistic that NYSE Euronext’s board would at some point agree to sit down for talks, Nasdaq was prepared to take the final step of going straight to the Big Board’s investors. “It is not the outcome that we want,” he said. “It is not the outcome that we expect.”</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/niederauer-talks-strategy/?ref=nyseeuronext">Niederauer Talks Strategy<date>April 20, 2011, 6:41 pm</date><text>Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, discusses pending merger bids with rival exchanges, saying his exchange’s strategy is best served by joining with Deutsche Börse.

Citing competitive pressures as exchanges around the world consolidate, the Nasdaq OMX Group and its partner, the IntercontinentalExchange, are trying to break up a proposed deal between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse by offering 19 percent more. Despite all the talk of globalization, the battle presents several nationalistic issues. Should the United States care about foreign ownership of the world’s premier stock exchange? Or should it matter if the nation’s two leading stock market operators combine, putting all stock listings in one place? While the takeover battle is complicated by the concerns of regulators and politicians, the question that will determine who will win is this: Can NYSE Euronext convince its shareholders that there is more value in a Deutsche Börse combination than the possibility of a Nasdaq offer? Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Nasdaq and ICE Unveil Official Bid for NYSE Euronext This question is shaped by two forces. The first is related to the shifting nature of the United States exchange business. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq overlap in two significant businesses: listing and trading. The trading business involves companies listed on the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq. It is in decline as new trading platforms like BATS emerge. Less than 40 percent of the trading in Nasdaq and N.Y.S.E. stocks occur on their platforms. The second business, listings, is also stagnant, but Nasdaq would reap huge benefits from acquiring NYSE Euronext. Nasdaq estimates that it could save $610 million a year from a merger by eliminating duplicative technology and thousands of employees. NYSE Euronext also has a growing derivatives business, but Nasdaq would sell this business to ICE. Nasdaq’s problem is that an acquisition of the N.Y.S.E. would eliminate Nasdaq’s only true competitor in the listings business in the United States. Nasdaq responds that the listing business and the fees it charges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the selection of listings is industry-biased. Internet companies, for example, tend to list on Nasdaq and stay there. Last year only 14 companies moved to the N.Y.S.E. from Nasdaq and three to Nasdaq from the Big Board. Nasdaq argues that the deal would not diminish competition since there is no competition. The N.Y.S.E. counters that there is ancillary competition for listings, namely in the other services that can be provided by the exchanges, like marketing. And anyone can see that one instead of two will be a less competitive market. The Big Board’s arguments appear to be compelling if only because no antitrust regulator wants to be seen as allowing the only competition to be swallowed up. Yet Nasdaq cites globalization as the second force driving this combination. Nasdaq argues the combination will preserve the competitive position of the United States. Nasdaq refers to figures that it says shows the United States is in decline: in 2010, the United States generated only 16 percent of capital raised worldwide and attracted the listing of only one of the 10 largest global initial public offerings. Unfortunately for Nasdaq, the global competition for listings is negligible. More than 95 percent of companies list in their own country. Nine of the 10 largest global I.P.O.’s cited by Nasdaq made their primary listing in their home country. A combination of N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq is unlikely to matter much in the competition for global listings. If the benefits to global competition may be overstated, should we care if the N.Y.S.E. is no longer American? NYSE Euronext seeks to paint the Deutsche Börse combination as a strategic alliance rather than a German acquisition. This is in part for legal reasons. As a strategic deal rather than a sale, NYSE does not have to sell to the highest bidder. This law is premised on the fact that NYSE Euronext’s shareholders will continue to benefit in this arrangement by owning part of the new entity. But 60 percent of the company will be owned by Deutsche Börse shareholders and the majority of directors will be from Deutsche Börse. Even if this is not a Deutsche Börse takeover, one culture may seek to dominate, and the Germans appear to be in position to do so. Remember Daimler-Chrysler? It is here where the oddities of global capital come into play. The “Germanness” of Deutsche Börse may be overstated. According to Capital IQ, four of Deutsche Börse five largest shareholders are American. So what exactly is the national interest? The Nasdaq acquisition implicates global issues but is actually a response to domestic pressures. American companies will continue to list on the N.Y.S.E. even if it is a company domiciled in the Netherlands. American shareholders will still own a NYSE-Deutsche Börse entity, and may even own a majority. It is thus a matter of pride. The emotion has emerged in the fun that blogs have had with possible names for the combined Deutsche Börse/NYSE. My favorite: Hot Dogs and Sauerkraut. But if the business is going to remain largely local, and the shareholders largely American, should we really care where the corporation is sited? If anything, it will allow for greater integration of the two entities and our cultures. The decision is before NYSE Euronext’s shareholders. A 75 percent vote of Deutsche Börse shareholders must approve this combination. Deutsche Börse has little room to raise its price. NYSE Euronext can put the deal to a vote by the summer and thereafter shareholders are locked into a deal with Deutsche Börse. There is no chance Nasdaq will obtain antitrust clearance before then. NYSE can thus force the issue. It is likely to avoid reaching any deal with Nasdaq until there is a vote on the Deutsche Börse combination, by citing the antitrust risk and demanding an enormous antitrust breakup fee, bigger than the $350 million Nasdaq offered. The goal is to avoid reaching a deal. NYSE Euronext shareholders will have to choose between the certainty of a Deutsche Börse bid and the uncertainty of Nasdaq’s ability to obtain antitrust clearance. Nasdaq could raise its offer, but without antitrust approval it is still quite risky. Perhaps Nasdaq knows all this and is simply trying to be a spoiler. NYSE Euronext shareholders could freeze in the headlights of a higher rival bid and decide to vote against the Deutsche Börse combination as they wait things out. NYSE Euronext’s talk of a dividend sweetener is an effort to forestall such a vote, and it has the advantage. According to Capital IQ, 71.5 percent of NYSE Euronext’s shareholders are institutional shareholders, and there is no significant hedge fund ownership. The institutions are different from the hedge funds and prefer certainty. The bird in the hand, you know. Nationalistic concerns appear likely to lose out to the antitrust issue since NYSE Euronext’s shareholders are probably not going to care if the New York exchange becomes part of a European corporation. And that seems right, even for the rest of us. Steven M.

The proposed 67-page merger agreement released by Nasdaq and ICE is meant to counter NYSE Euronext’s concerns about their earlier proposal, which was rejected for being “loosely worded” and “highly conditional.” NYSE Euronext has said that it remains committed to its $9.3 billion all-stock merger with Deutsche Börse. Its board, which is expected to discuss the offer on Thursday, still appears skeptical about the prospects for a Nasdaq-ICE bid. The company’s shareholders are expected to vote on that deal in July, and the stock market operator must win over a majority of them to gain approval. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Nasdaq-ICE press release Proposed merger agreement At Tuesday’s closing prices, the offer by Nasdaq and ICE is worth about $42.53 a share, while the Deutsche Börse proposal is worth about $35.56 a share. Chief among the new details in the Nasdaq-ICE proposal is a $350 million breakup fee that would be paid to NYSE Euronext if the takeover bid did not win antitrust approval. That fee is roughly comparable to the $357 million breakup fee specified in NYSE Euronext’s agreement with Deutsche Börse — which Nasdaq and ICE also agreed to reimburse. Nasdaq and ICE said they also plan to start the process for antitrust approval by buying $66 million worth of NYSE Euronext shares. The two bidders have already held preliminary talks with the Justice Department. That is important because NYSE Euronext has argued that the proposal, in which Nasdaq would take over the company’s stock-trading business and ICE would buy its derivatives platform, would not survive regulatory scrutiny. Nasdaq and ICE also said their lenders, including Bank of America, UBS, Wells Fargo and two Nordic banks, have officially committed to providing the $3.8 billion in financing needed to support their bid. Those banks have agreed to make the financing available for a year, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. Together, the newly disclosed provisions are an effort to entice NYSE Euronext to begin negotiations with Nasdaq and ICE. “We’ve come a long way to addressing what they spoke about in their letter,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview, referring to NYSE Euronext’s board. “They’re running out of reasons not to engage with us.” Mr. Greifeld said he was optimistic that the NYSE Euronext directors would at least meet with Nasdaq and ICE. But if they do not, he suggested that Nasdaq and ICE would consider other strategies — which analysts and the people who had been briefed on the matter say could include beginning a tender offer for NYSE Euronext shares. Mr. Greifeld also argued that creating two bigger exchanges, one focused on stock trading and one centered on derivatives, was a sounder strategy than creating one big “financial supermarket.” He added that the Deutsche Börse offer carried its own antitrust risks, primarily in Europe because it would involve combining the Continent’s two largest platforms for derivatives trading. He also said that despite taking on billions of dollars in new debt, the Nasdaq would be able to maintain an investment-grade credit rating, important because falling into junk status would accelerate the maturity of some debt and make it harder for the combined company to borrow. NYSE Euronext executives have privately expressed doubt about that, pointing to statements by Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s threatening to downgrade Nasdaq’s rating if a deal were to take place. NYSE Euronext said Tuesday in a statement that its board would study the new terms. But people close to the company said the board remained highly concerned about the antitrust risks. Deutsche Börse said in a statement that it remained committed to its NYSE Euronext agreement, calling it “the best possible combination in the industry.” But Nasdaq officials argue that combining their company with the Big Board does not pose as much of a monopolistic threat as it appears. Mr. Greifeld said the exchanges could not change their listing prices without approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Edward Ditmire, a research analyst at Macquarie Securities, said antitrust regulators would also consider other factors, including whether service and innovation would suffer by combining the country’s two largest markets operators. He said Tuesday’s announcement was not really aimed at NYSE Euronext’s board. “I think this is more of a play to bolster support among NYSE shareholders,” he said. Shares in NYSE Euronext rose about 1 percent on Tuesday, closing at $38.70.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/nyse-euronext-weighs-special-dividend-to-win-over-investors/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext Weighs Special Dividend to Win Over Investors<date>April 13, 2011, 5:00 pm</date><text>5:15 p.m. | Updated NYSE Euronext is considering a special dividend to its shareholders as one of several possibilities to win over investor support for its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Wednesday. The payout to NYSE Euronext shareholders would be before the deal’s closing, which is expected by the end of the year, pending shareholder approval. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are also weighing additional ways to pay out shareholders should the deal close, including dividends or share repurchases by the newly combined exchange operator, people briefed on the matter said. One detail that wouldn’t change is the ownership of the still-unnamed combined company. Deutsche Börse would still own 60 percent of that entity, in part to placate its own shareholder base. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Lobbying the Big Board's Shareholders The options were floated as part of the companies’ meetings with NYSE Euronext shareholders this week, in the wake of the Big Board operator’s rejection of a higher takeover proposal by the Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange, these people said. As of Wednesday’s closing prices, the Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-stock bid is worth $42.94 a share, or $11.2 billion. The Deutsche Börse all-stock proposal is worth about $9.7 billion. Shares in NYSE Euronext closed up about 1 percent at $38.26. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse officials believe that their merger would create a financially stronger company capable of additional payouts to shareholders. Executives at both companies have previously indicated that the merger could yield higher cost savings than planned, though those figures probably will not be amended anytime soon, these people said. By contrast, they have argued that the rival bid would strain the finances of Nasdaq, which would take over the stock-trading portions of NYSE Euronext. Both sides are trying to win over NYSE Euronext shareholders ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal. Both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse face high hurdles for their proposal: the former needs the approval of 51 percent of its shareholders, while the latter needs the approval of 75 percent of its own investors. Among the chief arguments by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse is that their proposal will create an international market powerhouse with strong positions in stock, options and derivatives trading. They also contend that the Nasdaq-ICE deal will be rejected by antitrust regulators wary of combining the United States’ two biggest stock market operators. Nasdaq and ICE counter that their bid is still worth more to NYSE Euronext shareholders, and that the Deutsche Börse merger faces its own antitrust issues in Europe because the merger would unite that continent’s two biggest derivatives trading platforms. News of the dividend suggestions was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/with-strong-quarter-nasdaq-presses-nyse-euronext-bid/?ref=nyseeuronext">Nasdaq Says It May Take Its NYSE Bid to Investors<date>April 20, 2011, 10:38 am</date><text>Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said he remained optimistic about deal talks. 7:37 p.m. | Updated Nasdaq OMX executives said on Wednesday that the company and its partner, the IntercontinentalExchange, were committed to pursuing NYSE Euronext through next April — and would take their $11.1 billion takeover bid directly to the Big Board’s shareholders if necessary.

Chief among the new details in the Nasdaq-ICE proposal is a $350 million breakup fee that would be paid to NYSE Euronext if the takeover bid did not win antitrust approval. That fee is roughly comparable to the $357 million breakup fee specified in NYSE Euronext’s agreement with Deutsche Börse — which Nasdaq and ICE also agreed to reimburse. Nasdaq and ICE said they also plan to start the process for antitrust approval by buying $66 million worth of NYSE Euronext shares. The two bidders have already held preliminary talks with the Justice Department. That is important because NYSE Euronext has argued that the proposal, in which Nasdaq would take over the company’s stock-trading business and ICE would buy its derivatives platform, would not survive regulatory scrutiny. Nasdaq and ICE also said their lenders, including Bank of America, UBS, Wells Fargo and two Nordic banks, have officially committed to providing the $3.8 billion in financing needed to support their bid. Those banks have agreed to make the financing available for a year, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. Together, the newly disclosed provisions are an effort to entice NYSE Euronext to begin negotiations with Nasdaq and ICE. “We’ve come a long way to addressing what they spoke about in their letter,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview, referring to NYSE Euronext’s board. “They’re running out of reasons not to engage with us.” Mr. Greifeld said he was optimistic that the NYSE Euronext directors would at least meet with Nasdaq and ICE. But if they do not, he suggested that Nasdaq and ICE would consider other strategies — which analysts and the people who had been briefed on the matter say could include beginning a tender offer for NYSE Euronext shares. Mr. Greifeld also argued that creating two bigger exchanges, one focused on stock trading and one centered on derivatives, was a sounder strategy than creating one big “financial supermarket.” He added that the Deutsche Börse offer carried its own antitrust risks, primarily in Europe because it would involve combining the Continent’s two largest platforms for derivatives trading. He also said that despite taking on billions of dollars in new debt, the Nasdaq would be able to maintain an investment-grade credit rating, important because falling into junk status would accelerate the maturity of some debt and make it harder for the combined company to borrow. NYSE Euronext executives have privately expressed doubt about that, pointing to statements by Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s threatening to downgrade Nasdaq’s rating if a deal were to take place. NYSE Euronext said Tuesday in a statement that its board would study the new terms. But people close to the company said the board remained highly concerned about the antitrust risks. Deutsche Börse said in a statement that it remained committed to its NYSE Euronext agreement, calling it “the best possible combination in the industry.” But Nasdaq officials argue that combining their company with the Big Board does not pose as much of a monopolistic threat as it appears. Mr. Greifeld said the exchanges could not change their listing prices without approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Edward Ditmire, a research analyst at Macquarie Securities, said antitrust regulators would also consider other factors, including whether service and innovation would suffer by combining the country’s two largest markets operators. He said Tuesday’s announcement was not really aimed at NYSE Euronext’s board. “I think this is more of a play to bolster support among NYSE shareholders,” he said. Shares in NYSE Euronext rose about 1 percent on Tuesday, closing at $38.70.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/nyse-euronext-weighs-special-dividend-to-win-over-investors/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext Weighs Special Dividend to Win Over Investors<date>April 13, 2011, 5:00 pm</date><text>5:15 p.m. | Updated NYSE Euronext is considering a special dividend to its shareholders as one of several possibilities to win over investor support for its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Wednesday. The payout to NYSE Euronext shareholders would be before the deal’s closing, which is expected by the end of the year, pending shareholder approval. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are also weighing additional ways to pay out shareholders should the deal close, including dividends or share repurchases by the newly combined exchange operator, people briefed on the matter said. One detail that wouldn’t change is the ownership of the still-unnamed combined company. Deutsche Börse would still own 60 percent of that entity, in part to placate its own shareholder base. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Lobbying the Big Board's Shareholders The options were floated as part of the companies’ meetings with NYSE Euronext shareholders this week, in the wake of the Big Board operator’s rejection of a higher takeover proposal by the Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange, these people said. As of Wednesday’s closing prices, the Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-stock bid is worth $42.94 a share, or $11.2 billion. The Deutsche Börse all-stock proposal is worth about $9.7 billion. Shares in NYSE Euronext closed up about 1 percent at $38.26. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse officials believe that their merger would create a financially stronger company capable of additional payouts to shareholders. Executives at both companies have previously indicated that the merger could yield higher cost savings than planned, though those figures probably will not be amended anytime soon, these people said. By contrast, they have argued that the rival bid would strain the finances of Nasdaq, which would take over the stock-trading portions of NYSE Euronext. Both sides are trying to win over NYSE Euronext shareholders ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal. Both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse face high hurdles for their proposal: the former needs the approval of 51 percent of its shareholders, while the latter needs the approval of 75 percent of its own investors. Among the chief arguments by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse is that their proposal will create an international market powerhouse with strong positions in stock, options and derivatives trading. They also contend that the Nasdaq-ICE deal will be rejected by antitrust regulators wary of combining the United States’ two biggest stock market operators. Nasdaq and ICE counter that their bid is still worth more to NYSE Euronext shareholders, and that the Deutsche Börse merger faces its own antitrust issues in Europe because the merger would unite that continent’s two biggest derivatives trading platforms. News of the dividend suggestions was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/german-exchange-doesnt-plan-to-sweeten-nyse-offer/?ref=nyseeuronext">German Exchange Doesn't Plan to Sweeten NYSE Offer<date>April 11, 2011, 1:36 pm</date><text>Deutsche Börse does not plan to sweeten the terms of its merger with NYSE Euronext, because top managers of the German exchange operator are convinced that a rival bid has little chance of success, people with knowledge of the transaction said Monday. Speaking a day after the NYSE Euronext board rejected a takeover offer that the Nasdaq OMX Group made in partnership with the IntercontinentalExchange, people close to the deal in Germany also disputed estimates that the competing offer is worth 20 percent more than a takeover by Deutsche Börse. The estimates failed to take into account other costs, like the $355 million breakup fee that NYSE would owe to Deutsche Börse if it accepted another offer, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Moreover, they said, there is a big risk that a tie-up with Nasdaq might never come to pass because of regulatory hurdles. For example, a combined Nasdaq and NYSE would have a practical monopoly on new listings, raising antitrust concerns. On Sunday, NYSE Euronext rejected the Nasdaq bid, citing a long list of concerns, including the job cuts in New York and the amount of debt necessary to finance their bid. Debt rating agencies have said that Nasdaq’s credit rating would suffer from the strain of financing the $11.3 billion offer. Executives at NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have been talking about a merger off and on for more than two years, giving them a huge head start on seeking the numerous regulatory approvals that will be required. Deutsche Börse planned to submit a draft of an offer to its shareholders to Germany’s bank regulator on Tuesday. The filing is an important step in making it possible for shareholders of both companies to vote on the deal in July. NYSE and Deutsche Börse plan to complete the merger by the end of the year. The head start also means that the two companies have already dealt with difficult questions like who will run the combined company. Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, would be chairman, and Duncan Niederauer, chairman of NYSE Euronext, would be chief executive. NYSE and Deutsche Börse have a binding contract, while the Nasdaq offer is what Mr. Niederauer on Sunday called a “loosely worded proposal.” However, the two companies have not agreed on a name for the new entity. They said that, in any case, they will preserve the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse brand names.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/the-big-boards-big-rejection/?ref=nyseeuronext">The Big Board's Big Rejection<date>April 11, 2011, 3:32 pm</date><text>On Sunday, NYSE Euronext rebuffed an $11.3 billion bid from the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, reaffirming a proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.

With NYSE Euronext rejecting an unwanted $11.3 billion takeover bid by its bitter rival, the Nasdaq OMX Group, and the IntercontinentalExchange, the battle over the Big Board is now shifting to shareholders. Over the last 24 hours, officials from NYSE Euronext have begun an offensive aimed at convincing its investors that the existing deal with Deutsche Börse has a greater chance of closing. In a statement on Sunday, NYSE Euronext criticized the unsolicited takeover bid as “highly conditional” and bearing “unacceptable execution risk.” At the moment, it is a battle of perception. The Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-stock bid was worth $42.96 a share, or $11.2 billion, as of Monday’s closing prices. The current Deutsche Börse all-stock deal, by contrast, is worth about $37.25 a share, or $9.7 billion. Deutsche Börse has indicated privately that it will not yet raise its price, according to people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. Nasdaq and ICE could raise their offer. Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill &amp; Partners, said it was unlikely that the two companies led with their “first, best and final offer” — but the price may be constrained by the amount of debt that Nasdaq can borrow to finance the transaction. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Shares in NYSE Euronext fell nearly 3 percent on Monday, to $37.59, while those in Nasdaq dropped about 1.5 percent, to $28.03. Shares in ICE essentially remained flat at $120.55, while those in Deutsche Börse rose slightly, to 54.93 euros ($79.55). Both sides have begun meeting with shareholders to press their cases, according to people briefed on the matter. It will probably come down to whether investors believe that Nasdaq’s proposal to combine the two biggest American stock markets can overcome significant antitrust hurdles or whether shareholders think that the lower-price deal with Deutsche Börse will lead to a bigger payoff down the road. Nasdaq and ICE are arguing, in part, that the NYSE Euronext board has breached its fiduciary duty to the company’s shareholders by forgoing a financially superior bid. At some point, the two may bring their offer directly to those shareholders, according to people briefed on the matter. For now, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse see no need to alter their existing agreement greatly, people close to the companies said. Duncan L. Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, said on CNBC that the proposed cost savings in the merger were on the conservative side. The people close to the companies said a formal revision of those figures was unlikely any time soon. Instead, both companies plan to argue that their merger will be better for shareholders in the long run, creating an international giant with strong presences in stocks, options and derivatives. They also hope to cast doubt on the Nasdaq and ICE proposal, arguing that it could not survive regulatory review in its current form. Still, NYSE Euronext acknowledged that the Deutsche Börse deal faces significant antitrust scrutiny in Europe, since it would combine two of the Continent’s biggest derivatives trading arenas. Deutsche Börse plans to submit a draft of an offer to its shareholders to Germany’s bank regulator on Tuesday. “I think both deals have risk. There’s no question about it,” Mr. Niederauer said in a CNBC interview, adding that the proposal would be heavily analyzed by European Union regulators. But NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse believe that they can win approval by making concessions like selling off parts of the business or opening up the platform to competitors, people close to both companies said. In response to arguments that the NYSE Euronext board is obligated to consider a higher proposal, the company has instead argued that its “merger of equals” agreement with Deutsche Börse does not set off legal requirements to consider a higher bid. Analysts appeared split over which proposal would prevail. In a note published on Monday, analysts at Stifel Nicolaus wrote that the merger with Deutsche Börse was likely to succeed, given that the Big Board leadership is staunchly backing the deal. “Aside from the aforementioned regulatory and political concerns, management has made the case for superior long-term strategic and financial value,” they wrote. But Rob Rutschow, an analyst at the brokerage firm CLSA, argued that shareholders were likely to focus on the immediate gains that might arise from the Nasdaq and ICE proposal. “It is hard to ignore a much higher value per share offered by Nasdaq and ICE, but NYSE’s management found a way to do it,” he wrote in a note published on Monday. NYSE Euronext shareholders will have their first chance to express their opinions at the company’s annual meeting on April 28. A formal vote on the deal is scheduled for July.

Instead, the company, which runs the long-established New York Stock Exchange as well as the Euronext based in Paris, said it would stand by its previous agreement to merge with Deutsche Börse. The bid by Nasdaq and ICE was a long shot, but the official decision could set off a contest in the coming months to win over the exchange shareholders ahead of a vote scheduled for July. Nasdaq and ICE had proposed splitting up NYSE Euronext into its two main businesses. Nasdaq would take over the New York Stock Exchange, creating the single biggest stock market in the United States, while ICE would buy the company's derivatives operations. The cash-and-stock bid by Nasdaq and ICE announced more than a week ago is valued at about $11.3 billion, or about $43.13 a share as of Friday. The bid was worth more than Deutsche Börse's all-stock agreement with NYSE Euronext, valued at $9.7 billion, or $36.98 a share. NYSE Euronext shares closed on Friday at $38.70, suggesting that shareholders may expect a richer offer from Deutsche Börse. The board and management on Sunday outlined a litany of concerns about the Nasdaq proposal, calling it ''highly conditional'' and arguing that it poses ''unacceptable'' risk to shareholders. ''Their loosely worded proposal didn't address the rather obvious execution risks,'' Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive, said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The company said the chief concern was that the Nasdaq bid might not survive review by antitrust regulators. Nasdaq and ICE expect about $740 million in cost savings three years after the deal closes, a figure driven by cutting jobs and eliminating duplicate back-end systems. That raises the risk that lawmakers, like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, may raise objections over the prospect of job losses in New York City. In its statement, NYSE Euronext also said it was also concerned about the amount of debt Nasdaq would borrow to finance its offer. Both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's have indicated that they may downgrade Nasdaq's credit rating if it proceeds with the bid. NYSE Euronext instead highlighted the benefits of the company's agreement to merge with Deutsche Börse, which would create a trans-Atlantic powerhouse in stock, options and derivatives trading. The exchange itself has sought to build itself up over the years. Its merger in 2006 with Euronext - which operates in several cities including Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels - significantly added to its offerings in the highly profitable derivatives trading business. ''We've had a long-term strategy that we've been following for several years,'' Mr. Niederauer said. ''To break up the company and sell it off in pieces is entirely inconsistent with that strategy.'' A merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse has been two years in the making, aimed at improving profit by increasing scale. Both the Big Board and Nasdaq have lost some ground to upstart electronic markets like BATS and Direct Edge. Deutsche Börse expressed confidence late Sunday that the merger with NYSE Euronext would go forward as planned and close by the end of the year. In a cautiously worded statement, Deutsche Börse suggested that it would offer more growth opportunities for the company than Nasdaq as well as wider geographic distribution, and more kinds of assets to trade. Deutsche Börse also noted that the parties have already begun seeking regulatory approval, and started planning how to combine the two companies. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq's chief executive, urged NYSE Euronext to meet with his company to discuss the merits of the proposal. ''NYSE Euronext's board of directors is depriving its stockholders of the benefits of a superior proposal,'' he said in a statement. Exchange operators around the globe have been consolidating, aiming to seek greater scale to drive bigger profits. But several of those proposals have run into political obstacles, as national regulators fear diminishing their countries' standings as global financial capitals. Last week, Australia formally rejected the Australian Securities Exchange's plan to merge with the Singapore Exchange, saying the deal ''would not be in the national interest'' in its current form. And Canadian lawmakers are closely scrutinizing the Toronto Stock Exchange's proposed merger with the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq's offer is being pitched as creating a new national champion, one based in New York and able to draw new stock listings that might otherwise head to foreign markets. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext plan to keep dual headquarters in Frankfurt and New York. Reto Francioni of Deutsche Börse would become chairman of the combined company, while Mr. Niederauer of NYSE Euronext would become its chief executive. Deutsche Börse shareholders would own 60 percent of the merged company, though both exchange operators have argued that the deal is a ''merger of equals.'' But Mr. Niederauer dismissed concerns about the United States losing status as a financial haven, arguing that the exchange already operates with headquarters in New York and Paris. ''I don't know that we would necessarily to do that deal to build an American stronghold,'' he said. ''We're competing just fine.''

Here’s how the various stocks are performing as of midday Monday: NYSE’s shares are down 2.3 percent, at $37.83. Deutsche Börse’s shares are up about 0.9 percent, at 54.93 euros.

Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: NYSE Euronext Rejects Bid A roundup of opinions shows a broad range of analyses as to what will happen next for NYSE; its preferred partner, Deutsche Börse; and its unwanted suitors, Nasdaq and ICE. Below is a sampling of the research notes out on Monday. Daniel T. Fannon of Jefferies was unsurprised by NYSE’s rejection, pointing in particular to the “extensive cost-cutting” that would attend a takeover by Nasdaq and ICE. Mr. Fannon also assigned a low probability of Nasdaq and ICE winning: “We also believe NDAQ will continue to pursue NYX but we view the likelihood of such a bid winning as low, given regulatory hurdles and resistance from NYX management, especially if the bid requires a breakup of some of NYX’s businesses.” Richard Repetto of Sandler O’Neill &amp; Partners wrote that, given the previous deal efforts of Nasdaq and ICE, it’s unlikely that the two led with their “first, best and final” offer. He also noted that NYSE’s board may not be legally compelled to seek out the highest possible sale price, though its shareholders remain in the driver’s seat. He added that the real power in the rejected bid may not be Nasdaq but ICE, which is supplying about 55 percent of the $11.3 billion offer. Mr. Repetto writes: “While most view NDAQ as the leader in the combined ICE NDAQ proposal, likely due to its perceived higher anti-trust risks, more debt load, and contentious cultural issues, clearly ICE should get its fair share of the focus by the NYX board &amp; shareholders as they evaluate the unsolicited proposal.” Rob Rutschow of CLSA was one of few analysts who professed surprise at the NYSE board’s decision, calling the Nasdaq-ICE bid financially superior and the result, “two well-run, pure-play stocks,” more desirable than “a conglomerate subject to European labor issues.” Mr. Rutschow sided with Nasdaq and ICE in suspecting that NYSE’s board had breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders by not having reached out to its unwanted suitors. “It is hard to ignore a much higher value per share offered by NASDAQ and ICE, but NYSE’s management found a way to do it,” he wrote. Based on his note, it appears that Mr. Rutschow has concluded that the Nasdaq-ICE bid is superior, including its yielding of greater cost savings, and criticized Deutsche Börse’s proposal too light on job cuts to yield enough efficiency to justify the deal. At the least, he writes, the German market operator will need to raise its offer price to prevail. Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus disagreed, writing that the Detusche Börse proposal is still likely to win out in the end, in part because of management’s staunch support of the deal. They write: “Aside from the aforementioned regulatory and political concerns, management has made the case for superior long-term strategic and financial value in the DB1 merger given the unique combination of the two premier European derivatives franchises.” Analysts at UBS said that the move augured well for Deutsche Börse’s stock price, raising their price target for the company’s shares to 75 euros. They wrote: “Although Nasdaq/ICE may increase their offer, we see the risk of DB1 rising their bid significantly as low. We continue to believe that the deal on the original terms (60% of the combined for DB1 shareholders) remains attractive.”</text></article><article index="11" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/nyse-euronext-rejects-takeover-bid-by-nasdaq-and-ice/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext Rejects Bid by Nasdaq and ICE<date>April 10, 2011, 1:56 pm</date><text>Andrew Gombert/European Pressphoto Agency A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 8:49 p.m. | Updated NYSE Euronext announced on Sunday that it would reject an unsolicited takeover bid by its rival, the Nasdaq OMX Group, and the IntercontinentalExchange, primarily over antitrust concerns.

Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, told DealBook in an interview by phone on Sunday that his company had pursued a years-long strategy for building up the company. Sticking to its $9.7 billion merger agreement with Deutsche Börse is the culmination of that growth strategy — and breaking up NYSE is the opposite path. “We’ve had a long-term strategy we’ve been following for several years,” he said. “To break up the company and sell it off in pieces is entirely inconsistent with that strategy.” As outlined in a securities filing on Thursday, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse began discussing a potential deal back in the fall of 2008. The idea is to create an international colossus with strengths in trading stocks, options and derivatives. The latter two are especially important, since they are higher-margin businesses. Nasdaq and ICE point out that their offer is worth significantly more than the Deutsche Börse merger agreement, and that it offers NYSE Euronext shareholders cash as well as stock. Furthermore, combining the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq could yield a new national champion on par with the single-market model used in other countries, including Britain. But Mr. Niederauer argued that the unsolicited bid was highly conditional and emphasized what was sure to be a talking point for months to come: “execution risk,” deal shorthand for obstacles to successfully closing a transaction. Chief among these is the antitrust concern that overshadows putting together the two biggest stock market operators in the United States. Then there are also the concerns, expressed by NYSE Euronext and some analysts, that Nasdaq might be stretching itself financially to support its bid. The smaller market operator has said it would borrow up to $3.8 billion in debt financing, prompting Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service to put Nasdaq in line for a potential credit rating downgrade. “Their loosely worded proposal didn’t address the rather obvious execution risks,” Mr. Niederauer said. “It’s very conditional and very, very hedged. I don’t think there’s much to respond to.” Which is not to say that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse do not also have antitrust questions to grapple with, especially in Europe. Mr. Niederauer said his management team and that of Deutsche Börse recognized that there were “some meaningful regulatory conversations we’ll need to have in Europe.” But he disputed the idea that combining the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq was the key to keeping the United States competitive as a global market. NYSE Euronext has succeeded with two main nerve centers in New York City and Paris, he argued, and the company over the last year claimed a majority of new listings in the United States. “I don’t know that we would necessarily to do that deal to build an American stronghold,” he said. “We’re competing just fine.” Mr. Niederauer added: “Do I wish that Sarbanes-Oxley were modified? Yes. Do I feel that we’re hamstrung in competing globally? No.” With regard to the new name for a combination with Deutsche Börse, Mr. Niederauer said executives had solicited suggestions, including from employees. But the formal new name of the company most likely will not be announced before shareholders vote in July, he said. Should it prevail, Nasdaq has proposed naming its new company “Nasdaq NYSE Euronext,” an effort to assuage antsy lawmakers. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have floated the idea of picking a generic holding company name like “Global Stock Exchange” to avoid offending anyone, though lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York are unlikely to like that idea. And there is one more thing that Mr. Niederauer wants people to know: the NYSE Euronext board’s rejection of the Nasdaq bid has nothing to do with the deep-rooted cultural differences between the two rivals. Some analysts have suggested that should Nasdaq win, Mr. Niederauer and his management team would be unlikely to work with, or for, the Nasdaq team led by Robert Greifeld. “There’s nothing personal about a decision to execute a strategy,” Mr. Niederauer said. “It shouldn’t be in anybody’s frame of reference.”</text></article><article index="13" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/battling-headwinds-in-a-shifting-m-a-marketplace/?ref=nyseeuronext">Battling Headwinds in a Shifting M.&amp;A. Marketplace<date>April 7, 2011, 12:02 am</date><text>Harry Campbell Where are all the strategic bidders? It’s true that some blockbuster strategic deals have been announced recently, including AT&amp;T’s $39 billion proposed acquisition of T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom and Nasdaq’s $11.3 billion unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext. But these deals belie a strange fact: strategic bidders, or bidders that are operating companies, appear hesitant to re-enter the takeover market. Recent transactions display this caution. In August, Dynegy agreed to sell itself for $548 million to the Blackstone Group. Shareholders protested that the price was too low and the deal was canceled. Carl C. Icahn emerged and offered $665 million for Dynegy, shareholders again protested and that deal fell apart, too. Two financial buyers had been more than willing to bid and shareholders thought another bidder could offer more, but no strategic bidder emerged. Similarly, in the Del Monte Foods buyout led by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vestar Capital Partners, and the buyout of J. Crew by Leonard Green &amp; Partners and TPG Capital, no strategic bidders emerged. In both cases, particularly that of J. Crew, there was talk that the price was too low. And in both instances, special mechanisms were eventually put in place to entice third-party bidders, including lowering or eliminating the termination fee typically payable to the initial bidder if a third-party bid succeeded. These changes made it much easier for strategic bidders to make an offer. Video: The Dot-com Boom, Then and Now. Despite speculation that Sears and Urban Outfitters were checking the fit of J. Crew, no offer was made. And no new bidder emerged in the buyout of Del Monte, the largest private equity deal announced last year. Graphic: Click for a fuller picture of the Silicon Valley money network Private equity firms have historically been at a disadvantage on how much they can offer. Strategic bidders can often realize greater cost savings and synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and combining and operating the acquired company more efficiently within their other operations.

But we are supposed to be back in more normal times, so why are strategic buyers hanging back? The apparent reluctance may be the result of a fundamental reassessment of the value of takeovers, one that was occurring even before the financial crisis. Since then, chief executives and boards have been more concerned with running their businesses and surviving than with chasing expansion through takeovers. This is particularly true when the chance of success is far less certain, as in hostile takeover attempts. No chief executive envies John E. McGlade of Air Products and Chemicals, who spent more than $100 million and a year of management time fruitlessly pursuing a hostile bid for Airgas. And BHP Billiton’s chief, Marius Kloppers, made two unsuccessful runs — one at Rio Tinto and the other at the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan — at a cost of about $800 million. The last 15 years have produced mergers that proved to be spectacular failures. AOL’s merger with Time Warner and Daimler’s acquisition of Chrysler are among the most notable. Together, these deals destroyed more than $150 billion in shareholder value. During this time, studies have shown that while there are gains to be made, many M.&amp;A. deals prove unsatisfactory for buyers. McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that only a third of merger deals create value. In a separate study, Prof. Robert F. Bruner, dean of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, found that almost half of deals failed, although these results were skewed by some spectacular miscues. These studies illustrate that achieving a successful merger is hard work, requiring strategic vision and a focus on integrating the acquired company. Let’s face it, buying companies is fun — the rush of adrenaline, the challenge of negotiations, money getting thrown around and an elegant closing dinner when the deal is done. But then the real work begins: merging differing business cultures and integrating company operations. Experts increasingly believe that the outcome of a merger depends in large part on the success of these efforts at integration. Deal-making is also being hampered by a shift in market sentiment away from the conglomerate and toward acquisitions that allow a company to focus on expanding its current lines of business. Few companies today can feasibly buy an orange juice company while owning a rental car company, as Beatrice Foods did in the 1980s. The numbers appear to bear this out. According to Dealogic, strategic mergers in the United States totaled about $682 billion last year, roughly the same as in 2009 and way down from the $1 trillion in such deals made in 2007. This is partly a result of the transformation of private equity firms, which increasingly are buying companies in the same lines of business, allowing them to combine functions and wring out additional cost savings once achievable only through strategic acquisitions. K.K.R.’s acquisition of Del Monte, the owner of the Kibbles ’n Bits, Meow Mix and Milk-Bone brands, was the firm’s second pet food acquisition in a year, for example. As a result, strategic deals now tend to be driven by factors aimed at long-term survival. The T-Mobile deal, in which AT&amp;T made its bid to forestall a sale of T-Mobile to Sprint, is a case in point. AT&amp;T is betting that the operational and cost savings from the acquisition will exceed $40 billion, making it a deal that pays for itself. AT&amp;T also wants to expand its wireless spectrum to meet the explosive demands placed on its network by today’s data-hungry mobile devices — a major reason the company was willing to make a deal that poses so many antitrust risks. Of course, strategic bidders are still making megadeals, but activity has been concentrated in select industries where consolidation or acquisitions are necessary for survival. In the natural resources and pharmaceutical sectors, for example, blockbuster deals have been robust. Perceived scarcity is also contributing to deal-making. The headlong rush into so-called cloud computing — the practice of using the Internet to process, manage and store data on remote network servers — led last year to a bidding war for 3Par in which Dell lost out to Hewlett-Packard. After its disappointment, Dell quickly acquired another such company, Compellent Technologies. Nasdaq’s unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext — an effort to thwart the merger agreement between NYSE and Deutsche Börse — can also be explained by Nasdaq’s desperation not to be shut out of the accelerating consolidation among global stock exchanges. With so many factors weighing on deal-makers’ minds, investment bankers will have to work harder to coax companies to the M.&amp;A. table. But when a deal is reached, those same factors may give bidders confidence that their offers will not be trumped. Despite a rush to view any announced megadeal as a harbinger of a revived M.&amp;A. market, deal premiums may actually decline — and the heady days of merger mania may be slow to return. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/deals-creep-back-though-not-yet-to-the-mega-level/?ref=nyseeuronext">Deals Creep Back, Though Not Yet to the Mega Level<date>April 7, 2011, 12:01 am</date><text>Bigger deals are back. Despite a series of potential shocks to the global economy, deal makers just completed their strongest quarter since before the financial crisis. And with that robust start, capped by AT&amp;T’s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA, many bankers are hopeful that the revival will pick up speed. As if to confirm that, another batch of deals was announced just after the quarter ended on March 31, including Vivendi’s $11.3 billion buyout of Vodafone’s stake in SFR of France, an $11.3 billion rival bid for NYSE Euronext by the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, and Texas Instruments’ $6.5 billion takeover of National Semiconductor. The dollar volume of mergers struck in the first quarter jumped 54.7 percent from the comparable period a year eariler, to $799.8 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The overall number of deals fell about 5 percent, to 9,600, Thomson Reuters said. But the real story lay in the number of deals over $5 billion, which made up a little more than 41 percent of all mergers in the quarter.

North America still has the largest slice of the deal-making pie for the quarter, accounting for $408.3 billion worth of mergers, or about 51 percent. But deals in emerging markets grew to about a quarter of the total, at $196.3 billion. Buyers from rising industrial powers, including China, India and Brazil, are likely to continue looking beyond their borders for natural resources. This week, Minmetals Resources, a publicly traded unit of a Chinese state-owned mining company, offered $6.5 billion for Equinox Minerals of Canada in an effort to buy a major producer of copper. By many measures, the ingredients for deal-making remain in place. The stock markets have largely shrugged off unforeseen events like the market flash crash of last May and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of last month, helping to establish a steady line for stock prices. Companies remain flush with cash that they began stockpiling in late 2008; some $1.9 trillion is in American corporate coffers, according to the Federal Reserve. (Most of that cash is being held abroad, however, and for tax reasons companies may choose not to spend it on deals in the United States.) The New York Times Management teams have shown more confidence in pursuing new avenues of growth that complement their existing businesses, although several conglomerates — among them Sara Lee, ITT and Fortune Brands — have chosen to break themselves into parts to focus on a few operations. “Strategic acquirers are reinforcing their core business,” Antonio Weiss, the global head of investment banking at Lazard, said at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute last week. “You don’t see a lot of diversifying transactions.” Another measure of growing corporate confidence is the unsolicited or hostile deal. Like Nasdaq and ICE in their bid for NYSE, or Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in its $5.7 billion hostile bid for Cephalon, rebuffed suitors have shown a willingness to mount a fight and press forward, hoping to find shareholders willing to sell. Cheap financing remains widely available as interest rates stay near record lows, and debt investors continue to buy up riskier loans and bonds in pursuit of better yields. Nowhere was this clearer than in JPMorgan Chase’s $20 billion loan to AT&amp;T to help it finance its T-Mobile deal. It was the largest loan ever by a single originating bank. But JPMorgan was also confident that it could quickly sell off pieces to other banks to help lower the risk on its own books, and it syndicated the loan in a matter of days. The New York Times The preponderance of cheap debt has also supported buyout firms, which struck $51.4 billion worth of deals during the first quarter. Deal makers are still breathlessly awaiting the return of megabuyouts over $10 billion — a level not attained since the Blackstone Group’s $25 billion takeover of Hilton Hotels nearly four years ago. Buyout firms have been getting closer: Blackstone spent $9.4 billion to acquire the American assets of Centro Properties in February. This week, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed to buy Pfizer’s capsule-making business for $2.4 billion, while Apax Partners agreed to buy two software companies for about $2 billion. More private equity deals are likely to be in the offing. K.K.R. executives told public investors last month that the firm had more than $11 billion in untapped capital to spend on buyouts. “That is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe,” Alexander Navab, the firm’s co-head of North American private equity, said at a meeting with investors last month. But the pace of their deals may be slowed if strategic buyers fully re-emerge as competitors. During the buyout boom, private equity firms were often the only bidders in big auctions. The uptick in announced deals has also benefited the bankers who put them together. Fees from mergers and acquisitions grew 3.3 percent in the first quarter from the same time last year, to $7.1 billion. That accounted for about a third of all investment banking fees for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. But the sunny outlook is not without some clouds. While continued unrest in the Middle East has not yet dented the pace of deal-making, advisers caution that the uprisings may spread. Rising prices of commodities like oil and cotton could also weigh on corporate profits, making companies more hesitant to spend. And the European sovereign debt crisis, which has hung over the Continent for more than a year, may again resurface as a serious threat to corporate confidence. Deal makers almost universally profess to seeing a continued increase in deal-making, but a gradual one, with no sharp jumps in volume and numbers. So far, they say, their backlogs of pending transactions appear to bear that out. “People are upbeat, and while it gets sometimes overused, ‘cautiously optimistic’ is a great description,” said Robert E. Spatt, a partner at the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.

These decisions will be guided by the acquisition agreement that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have entered into to govern their combination as well as Delaware law, NYSE Euronext’s place of incorporation. Under the NYSE/Deutsche Börse acquisition agreement, NYSE Euronext is now required to notify Deutsche Börse of Nasdaq’s acquisition proposal in the next two business days. NYSE Euronext is also now obligated to keep Deutsche Börse informed of the status and details of Nasdaq’s proposal and any negotiations that occur. If the NYSE Euronext board wants to discuss Nasdaq’s proposal with Nasdaq, then the NYSE Euronext board is required by the NYSE/Deutsche Börse agreement to determine that Nasdaq’s proposal could be a “superior proposal.” “Superior proposal” is defined in the NYSE/Deutsche Börse acquisition agreement as: a bona fide written acquisition proposal . . . . that the board of directors of NYSE Euronext . . . . in good faith concludes (following receipt of the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the acquisition proposal or offer and this agreement, and taking into account any improved terms that Deutsche Börse . . . . may have offered . . . . (including conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation and the ability of the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such acquisition proposal) are more favorable to the stockholders of NYSE Euronext. This is a long definition, but it basically requires the NYSE Euronext board to consider the regulatory risk on the Nasdaq deal as well as the amount offered in deciding whether it is more favorable to NYSE Euronext shareholders. If the NYSE Euronext board does decide that the Nasdaq bid could lead to a “superior proposal,” NYSE Euronext can speak with and provide confidential information to Nasdaq. As a condition to these discussions, though, the acquisition agreement requires Nasdaq to enter into a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to NYSE Euronext than the one it has with Deutsche Börse. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: The Hostile Play for NYSE DealBook: A Test for Nasdaq's Chief We do not know if the Deutsche Börse confidentiality agreement contains a standstill, but if it does, then Nasdaq may resist entering into such an agreement as it would halt its bid. NYSE Euronext may be stuck here though, leading to litigation over the issue. If, after talking with Nasadaq, the NYSE Euronext board deems its proposal to be superior, the board can then change its recommendation and urge NYSE Euronext shareholders to vote against the Deutsche Börse deal. Before doing so, however, NYSE Euronext must provide Duetsche Börse five business days to match Nasdaq’s offer. If Deutsche Börse matches, then the whole process is reset and Deutsche Börse is given a new five day opportunity to match. The operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange thus has an advantage over Nasdaq if it wants to get into a bidding war. Moreover, the acquisition agreement contains a “force the vote” provision. NYSE Euronext cannot terminate the acquisition agreement and, if Deutsche Börse demands it, NYSE Euronext must put the Deutsche Börse deal up to a vote of NYSE Euronext shareholders. This would drag out the contest, something that is certainly within Deutsche Börse’s rights. Nasdaq, which is being advised by longtime deal-makers John A. Marzulli Jr. and Robert Katz at Shearman &amp; Sterling, will need time to obtain regulatory approvals so it may not care as much. If Deutsche Börse requires a vote, NYSE Euronext would have to wait until its shareholders voted down the deal to agree to be acquired by Nasdaq. Only then could NYSE Euronext enter into a deal with Nasdaq, an event which would require NYSE Euronext to pay a termination fee of 250 million euros to Deutsche Börse. But all of this assumes that NYSE Euronext board wants to sell. It currently is engaging in a strategic combination with Deutsche Börse. Because this is a stock-for-stock merger and not a sale of NYSE Euronext, the NYSE Euronext board is not subject to so-called Revlon duties that require the board to obtain the highest price reasonably available when a company is sold. Since Revlon duties do not apply, the NYSE Euronext board can resist the Nasdaq bid and assert that more long-term value will be provided to its shareholders through a strategic combination with Deutsche Börse. NYSE Euronext shareholders can still reject the Deutsche Börse deal even if the NYSE Euronext board still supports it. But if the NYSE Euronext board wants to be aggressive it can do what happened in the merger of Time and Warner Communications in 1989. In that deal, the parties flipped a strategic stock for stock combination into a cash acquisition of Warner by Time in order to fight off a hostile bid for Time by Paramount. Cash acquisitions do not normally require a shareholder vote by the acquiring company’s shareholders and so Time was able to complete the combination via this route. In this situation Deutsche Börse would have to agree to the conversion to a pure acquisition and NYSE Euronext would have to obtain cash financing, but in such a circumstance no vote of NYSE Euronext shareholders would be required. This would be a very aggressive maneuver though, something not attempted by a major company since the Time/Warner deal. Look to see the route the NYSE Euronext board takes in response to this bid. If the board declares that the Nasdaq offer could lead to a superior proposal, something fairly obvious right now, it likely means that the board has decided to auction the company, subject to obtaining satisfaction on any regulatory issues. But if the board refuses to even contemplate the Nasdaq proposal, it is looking either to complete the Deutsch Börse deal or remain independent. Of course, the market may successfully demand that the NYSE Euronext board negotiate, but the board will be guided by the goal posts set by its acquisition agreement and Delaware law. Steven M.

Instead, the company, which runs the long-established New York Stock Exchange as well as the Euronext based in Paris, said it would stand by its previous agreement to merge with Deutsche Börse. The bid by Nasdaq and ICE is seen by some analysts as a long shot, but the official decision could set off a contest in the coming months to win over the exchange shareholders ahead of a vote scheduled for July. Nasdaq and ICE had proposed splitting up NYSE Euronext into its two main businesses. Nasdaq would take over the New York Stock Exchange, creating the single biggest stock market in the United States, while ICE would buy the company’s derivatives operations. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links NYSE Euronext press release Nasdaq-ICE press release DealBook: NYSE Euronext Chief on Rejecting Nasdaq's Bid The cash-and-stock bid by Nasdaq and ICE announced more than a week ago is valued at about $11.3 billion, or about $43.13 a share as of Friday. The bid was worth more than Deutsche Börse’s all-stock agreement with NYSE Euronext, valued at $9.7 billion, or $36.98 a share. NYSE Euronext shares closed on Friday at $38.70, suggesting that shareholders may expect a richer offer from Deutsche Börse. The board and management on Sunday outlined a litany of concerns about the Nasdaq proposal, calling it “highly conditional” and arguing that it poses “unacceptable” risk to shareholders. “Their loosely worded proposal didn’t address the rather obvious execution risks,” Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive, said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The company said the chief concern was that the Nasdaq bid might not survive review by antitrust regulators. Nasdaq and ICE expect about $740 million in cost savings three years after the deal closes, a figure driven by cutting jobs and eliminating duplicate back-end systems. That raises the risk that lawmakers, like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, may raise objections over the prospect of job losses in New York City. In its statement, NYSE Euronext also said it was also concerned about the amount of debt Nasdaq would borrow to finance its offer. Both Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s have indicated that they may downgrade Nasdaq’s credit rating if it proceeds with the bid. NYSE Euronext instead highlighted the benefits of the company’s agreement to merge with Deutsche Börse, which would create a trans-Atlantic powerhouse in stock, options and derivatives trading. The exchange itself has sought to build itself up over the years. Its merger in 2006 with Euronext — which operates in several cities including Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels — significantly added to its offerings in the highly profitable derivatives trading business. “We’ve had a long-term strategy that we’ve been following for several years,” Mr. Niederauer said. “To break up the company and sell it off in pieces is entirely inconsistent with that strategy.” A merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse has been two years in the making, aimed at improving profit by increasing scale. Both the Big Board and Nasdaq have lost some ground to upstart electronic markets like BATS and Direct Edge. Deutsche Börse expressed confidence late Sunday that the merger with NYSE Euronext would go forward as planned and close by the end of the year. In a cautiously worded statement, Deutsche Börse suggested that it would offer more growth opportunities for the company than Nasdaq as well as wider geographic distribution, and more kinds of assets to trade. Deutsche Börse also noted that the parties have already begun seeking regulatory approval, and started planning how to combine the two companies. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, urged NYSE Euronext to meet with his company to discuss the merits of the proposal. “NYSE Euronext’s board of directors is depriving its stockholders of the benefits of a superior proposal,” he said in a statement. Exchange operators around the globe have been consolidating, aiming to seek greater scale to drive bigger profits. But several of those proposals have run into political obstacles, as national regulators fear diminishing their countries’ standings as global financial capitals. Last week, Australia formally rejected the Australian Securities Exchange’s plan to merge with the Singapore Exchange, saying the deal “would not be in the national interest” in its current form. And Canadian lawmakers are closely scrutinizing the Toronto Stock Exchange’s proposed merger with the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq’s offer is being pitched as creating a new national champion, one based in New York and able to draw new stock listings that might otherwise head to foreign markets. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext plan to keep dual headquarters in Frankfurt and New York. Reto Francioni of Deutsche Börse would become chairman of the combined company, while Mr. Niederauer of NYSE Euronext would become its chief executive. Deutsche Börse shareholders would own 60 percent of the merged company, though both exchange operators have argued that the deal is a “merger of equals.” But Mr. Niederauer dismissed concerns about the United States losing status as a financial haven, arguing that the exchange already operates with headquarters in New York and Paris. “I don’t know that we would necessarily to do that deal to build an American stronghold,” he said. “We’re competing just fine.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/nyse-chief-on-nasdaqs-bid-inconsistent-with-long-term-strategy/?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Euronext Chief Calls Nasdaq's Bid 'Inconsistent' With Long-Term Strategy<date>April 10, 2011, 7:30 pm</date><text>In rejecting an $11.3 billion takeover bid by the Nasdaq OMX Group and the IntercontinentalExchange, NYSE Euronext made a forceful case that a merger with Deutsche Börse was the real way to generate long-term value. Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, told DealBook in an interview by phone on Sunday that his company had pursued a years-long strategy for building up the company. Sticking to its $9.7 billion merger agreement with Deutsche Börse is the culmination of that growth strategy — and breaking up NYSE is the opposite path. “We’ve had a long-term strategy we’ve been following for several years,” he said. “To break up the company and sell it off in pieces is entirely inconsistent with that strategy.” As outlined in a securities filing on Thursday, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse began discussing a potential deal back in the fall of 2008. The idea is to create an international colossus with strengths in trading stocks, options and derivatives. The latter two are especially important, since they are higher-margin businesses. Nasdaq and ICE point out that their offer is worth significantly more than the Deutsche Börse merger agreement, and that it offers NYSE Euronext shareholders cash as well as stock. Furthermore, combining the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq could yield a new national champion on par with the single-market model used in other countries, including Britain. But Mr. Niederauer argued that the unsolicited bid was highly conditional and emphasized what was sure to be a talking point for months to come: “execution risk,” deal shorthand for obstacles to successfully closing a transaction. Chief among these is the antitrust concern that overshadows putting together the two biggest stock market operators in the United States. Then there are also the concerns, expressed by NYSE Euronext and some analysts, that Nasdaq might be stretching itself financially to support its bid. The smaller market operator has said it would borrow up to $3.8 billion in debt financing, prompting Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service to put Nasdaq in line for a potential credit rating downgrade. “Their loosely worded proposal didn’t address the rather obvious execution risks,” Mr. Niederauer said. “It’s very conditional and very, very hedged. I don’t think there’s much to respond to.” Which is not to say that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse do not also have antitrust questions to grapple with, especially in Europe. Mr. Niederauer said his management team and that of Deutsche Börse recognized that there were “some meaningful regulatory conversations we’ll need to have in Europe.” But he disputed the idea that combining the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq was the key to keeping the United States competitive as a global market. NYSE Euronext has succeeded with two main nerve centers in New York City and Paris, he argued, and the company over the last year claimed a majority of new listings in the United States. “I don’t know that we would necessarily to do that deal to build an American stronghold,” he said. “We’re competing just fine.” Mr. Niederauer added: “Do I wish that Sarbanes-Oxley were modified? Yes. Do I feel that we’re hamstrung in competing globally? No.” With regard to the new name for a combination with Deutsche Börse, Mr. Niederauer said executives had solicited suggestions, including from employees. But the formal new name of the company most likely will not be announced before shareholders vote in July, he said. Should it prevail, Nasdaq has proposed naming its new company “Nasdaq NYSE Euronext,” an effort to assuage antsy lawmakers. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have floated the idea of picking a generic holding company name like “Global Stock Exchange” to avoid offending anyone, though lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York are unlikely to like that idea. And there is one more thing that Mr. Niederauer wants people to know: the NYSE Euronext board’s rejection of the Nasdaq bid has nothing to do with the deep-rooted cultural differences between the two rivals. Some analysts have suggested that should Nasdaq win, Mr. Niederauer and his management team would be unlikely to work with, or for, the Nasdaq team led by Robert Greifeld. “There’s nothing personal about a decision to execute a strategy,” Mr. Niederauer said. “It shouldn’t be in anybody’s frame of reference.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/battling-headwinds-in-a-shifting-m-a-marketplace/?ref=nyseeuronext">Battling Headwinds in a Shifting M.&amp;A.

It’s true that some blockbuster strategic deals have been announced recently, including AT&amp;T’s $39 billion proposed acquisition of T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom and Nasdaq’s $11.3 billion unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext. But these deals belie a strange fact: strategic bidders, or bidders that are operating companies, appear hesitant to re-enter the takeover market. Recent transactions display this caution. In August, Dynegy agreed to sell itself for $548 million to the Blackstone Group. Shareholders protested that the price was too low and the deal was canceled. Carl C. Icahn emerged and offered $665 million for Dynegy, shareholders again protested and that deal fell apart, too. Two financial buyers had been more than willing to bid and shareholders thought another bidder could offer more, but no strategic bidder emerged. Similarly, in the Del Monte Foods buyout led by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vestar Capital Partners, and the buyout of J. Crew by Leonard Green &amp; Partners and TPG Capital, no strategic bidders emerged. In both cases, particularly that of J. Crew, there was talk that the price was too low. And in both instances, special mechanisms were eventually put in place to entice third-party bidders, including lowering or eliminating the termination fee typically payable to the initial bidder if a third-party bid succeeded. These changes made it much easier for strategic bidders to make an offer. Video: The Dot-com Boom, Then and Now. Despite speculation that Sears and Urban Outfitters were checking the fit of J. Crew, no offer was made. And no new bidder emerged in the buyout of Del Monte, the largest private equity deal announced last year. Graphic: Click for a fuller picture of the Silicon Valley money network Private equity firms have historically been at a disadvantage on how much they can offer. Strategic bidders can often realize greater cost savings and synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and combining and operating the acquired company more efficiently within their other operations.

The apparent reluctance may be the result of a fundamental reassessment of the value of takeovers, one that was occurring even before the financial crisis. Since then, chief executives and boards have been more concerned with running their businesses and surviving than with chasing expansion through takeovers. This is particularly true when the chance of success is far less certain, as in hostile takeover attempts. No chief executive envies John E. McGlade of Air Products and Chemicals, who spent more than $100 million and a year of management time fruitlessly pursuing a hostile bid for Airgas. And BHP Billiton’s chief, Marius Kloppers, made two unsuccessful runs — one at Rio Tinto and the other at the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan — at a cost of about $800 million. The last 15 years have produced mergers that proved to be spectacular failures. AOL’s merger with Time Warner and Daimler’s acquisition of Chrysler are among the most notable. Together, these deals destroyed more than $150 billion in shareholder value. During this time, studies have shown that while there are gains to be made, many M.&amp;A. deals prove unsatisfactory for buyers. McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that only a third of merger deals create value. In a separate study, Prof. Robert F. Bruner, dean of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, found that almost half of deals failed, although these results were skewed by some spectacular miscues. These studies illustrate that achieving a successful merger is hard work, requiring strategic vision and a focus on integrating the acquired company. Let’s face it, buying companies is fun — the rush of adrenaline, the challenge of negotiations, money getting thrown around and an elegant closing dinner when the deal is done. But then the real work begins: merging differing business cultures and integrating company operations. Experts increasingly believe that the outcome of a merger depends in large part on the success of these efforts at integration. Deal-making is also being hampered by a shift in market sentiment away from the conglomerate and toward acquisitions that allow a company to focus on expanding its current lines of business. Few companies today can feasibly buy an orange juice company while owning a rental car company, as Beatrice Foods did in the 1980s. The numbers appear to bear this out. According to Dealogic, strategic mergers in the United States totaled about $682 billion last year, roughly the same as in 2009 and way down from the $1 trillion in such deals made in 2007. This is partly a result of the transformation of private equity firms, which increasingly are buying companies in the same lines of business, allowing them to combine functions and wring out additional cost savings once achievable only through strategic acquisitions. K.K.R.’s acquisition of Del Monte, the owner of the Kibbles ’n Bits, Meow Mix and Milk-Bone brands, was the firm’s second pet food acquisition in a year, for example. As a result, strategic deals now tend to be driven by factors aimed at long-term survival. The T-Mobile deal, in which AT&amp;T made its bid to forestall a sale of T-Mobile to Sprint, is a case in point. AT&amp;T is betting that the operational and cost savings from the acquisition will exceed $40 billion, making it a deal that pays for itself. AT&amp;T also wants to expand its wireless spectrum to meet the explosive demands placed on its network by today’s data-hungry mobile devices — a major reason the company was willing to make a deal that poses so many antitrust risks. Of course, strategic bidders are still making megadeals, but activity has been concentrated in select industries where consolidation or acquisitions are necessary for survival. In the natural resources and pharmaceutical sectors, for example, blockbuster deals have been robust. Perceived scarcity is also contributing to deal-making. The headlong rush into so-called cloud computing — the practice of using the Internet to process, manage and store data on remote network servers — led last year to a bidding war for 3Par in which Dell lost out to Hewlett-Packard. After its disappointment, Dell quickly acquired another such company, Compellent Technologies. Nasdaq’s unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext — an effort to thwart the merger agreement between NYSE and Deutsche Börse — can also be explained by Nasdaq’s desperation not to be shut out of the accelerating consolidation among global stock exchanges. With so many factors weighing on deal-makers’ minds, investment bankers will have to work harder to coax companies to the M.&amp;A. table. But when a deal is reached, those same factors may give bidders confidence that their offers will not be trumped. Despite a rush to view any announced megadeal as a harbinger of a revived M.&amp;A. market, deal premiums may actually decline — and the heady days of merger mania may be slow to return. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/deals-creep-back-though-not-yet-to-the-mega-level/?ref=nyseeuronext">Deals Creep Back, Though Not Yet to the Mega Level<date>April 7, 2011, 12:01 am</date><text>Bigger deals are back. Despite a series of potential shocks to the global economy, deal makers just completed their strongest quarter since before the financial crisis. And with that robust start, capped by AT&amp;T’s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA, many bankers are hopeful that the revival will pick up speed. As if to confirm that, another batch of deals was announced just after the quarter ended on March 31, including Vivendi’s $11.3 billion buyout of Vodafone’s stake in SFR of France, an $11.3 billion rival bid for NYSE Euronext by the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, and Texas Instruments’ $6.5 billion takeover of National Semiconductor. The dollar volume of mergers struck in the first quarter jumped 54.7 percent from the comparable period a year eariler, to $799.8 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The overall number of deals fell about 5 percent, to 9,600, Thomson Reuters said. But the real story lay in the number of deals over $5 billion, which made up a little more than 41 percent of all mergers in the quarter.

North America still has the largest slice of the deal-making pie for the quarter, accounting for $408.3 billion worth of mergers, or about 51 percent. But deals in emerging markets grew to about a quarter of the total, at $196.3 billion. Buyers from rising industrial powers, including China, India and Brazil, are likely to continue looking beyond their borders for natural resources. This week, Minmetals Resources, a publicly traded unit of a Chinese state-owned mining company, offered $6.5 billion for Equinox Minerals of Canada in an effort to buy a major producer of copper. By many measures, the ingredients for deal-making remain in place. The stock markets have largely shrugged off unforeseen events like the market flash crash of last May and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of last month, helping to establish a steady line for stock prices. Companies remain flush with cash that they began stockpiling in late 2008; some $1.9 trillion is in American corporate coffers, according to the Federal Reserve. (Most of that cash is being held abroad, however, and for tax reasons companies may choose not to spend it on deals in the United States.) The New York Times Management teams have shown more confidence in pursuing new avenues of growth that complement their existing businesses, although several conglomerates — among them Sara Lee, ITT and Fortune Brands — have chosen to break themselves into parts to focus on a few operations. “Strategic acquirers are reinforcing their core business,” Antonio Weiss, the global head of investment banking at Lazard, said at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute last week. “You don’t see a lot of diversifying transactions.” Another measure of growing corporate confidence is the unsolicited or hostile deal. Like Nasdaq and ICE in their bid for NYSE, or Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in its $5.7 billion hostile bid for Cephalon, rebuffed suitors have shown a willingness to mount a fight and press forward, hoping to find shareholders willing to sell. Cheap financing remains widely available as interest rates stay near record lows, and debt investors continue to buy up riskier loans and bonds in pursuit of better yields. Nowhere was this clearer than in JPMorgan Chase’s $20 billion loan to AT&amp;T to help it finance its T-Mobile deal. It was the largest loan ever by a single originating bank. But JPMorgan was also confident that it could quickly sell off pieces to other banks to help lower the risk on its own books, and it syndicated the loan in a matter of days. The New York Times The preponderance of cheap debt has also supported buyout firms, which struck $51.4 billion worth of deals during the first quarter. Deal makers are still breathlessly awaiting the return of megabuyouts over $10 billion — a level not attained since the Blackstone Group’s $25 billion takeover of Hilton Hotels nearly four years ago. Buyout firms have been getting closer: Blackstone spent $9.4 billion to acquire the American assets of Centro Properties in February. This week, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed to buy Pfizer’s capsule-making business for $2.4 billion, while Apax Partners agreed to buy two software companies for about $2 billion. More private equity deals are likely to be in the offing. K.K.R. executives told public investors last month that the firm had more than $11 billion in untapped capital to spend on buyouts. “That is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe,” Alexander Navab, the firm’s co-head of North American private equity, said at a meeting with investors last month. But the pace of their deals may be slowed if strategic buyers fully re-emerge as competitors. During the buyout boom, private equity firms were often the only bidders in big auctions. The uptick in announced deals has also benefited the bankers who put them together. Fees from mergers and acquisitions grew 3.3 percent in the first quarter from the same time last year, to $7.1 billion. That accounted for about a third of all investment banking fees for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. But the sunny outlook is not without some clouds. While continued unrest in the Middle East has not yet dented the pace of deal-making, advisers caution that the uprisings may spread. Rising prices of commodities like oil and cotton could also weigh on corporate profits, making companies more hesitant to spend. And the European sovereign debt crisis, which has hung over the Continent for more than a year, may again resurface as a serious threat to corporate confidence. Deal makers almost universally profess to seeing a continued increase in deal-making, but a gradual one, with no sharp jumps in volume and numbers. So far, they say, their backlogs of pending transactions appear to bear that out. “People are upbeat, and while it gets sometimes overused, ‘cautiously optimistic’ is a great description,” said Robert E. Spatt, a partner at the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.

These decisions will be guided by the acquisition agreement that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have entered into to govern their combination as well as Delaware law, NYSE Euronext’s place of incorporation. Under the NYSE/Deutsche Börse acquisition agreement, NYSE Euronext is now required to notify Deutsche Börse of Nasdaq’s acquisition proposal in the next two business days. NYSE Euronext is also now obligated to keep Deutsche Börse informed of the status and details of Nasdaq’s proposal and any negotiations that occur. If the NYSE Euronext board wants to discuss Nasdaq’s proposal with Nasdaq, then the NYSE Euronext board is required by the NYSE/Deutsche Börse agreement to determine that Nasdaq’s proposal could be a “superior proposal.” “Superior proposal” is defined in the NYSE/Deutsche Börse acquisition agreement as: a bona fide written acquisition proposal . . . . that the board of directors of NYSE Euronext . . . . in good faith concludes (following receipt of the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the acquisition proposal or offer and this agreement, and taking into account any improved terms that Deutsche Börse . . . . may have offered . . . . (including conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation and the ability of the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such acquisition proposal) are more favorable to the stockholders of NYSE Euronext. This is a long definition, but it basically requires the NYSE Euronext board to consider the regulatory risk on the Nasdaq deal as well as the amount offered in deciding whether it is more favorable to NYSE Euronext shareholders. If the NYSE Euronext board does decide that the Nasdaq bid could lead to a “superior proposal,” NYSE Euronext can speak with and provide confidential information to Nasdaq. As a condition to these discussions, though, the acquisition agreement requires Nasdaq to enter into a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to NYSE Euronext than the one it has with Deutsche Börse. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: The Hostile Play for NYSE DealBook: A Test for Nasdaq's Chief We do not know if the Deutsche Börse confidentiality agreement contains a standstill, but if it does, then Nasdaq may resist entering into such an agreement as it would halt its bid. NYSE Euronext may be stuck here though, leading to litigation over the issue. If, after talking with Nasadaq, the NYSE Euronext board deems its proposal to be superior, the board can then change its recommendation and urge NYSE Euronext shareholders to vote against the Deutsche Börse deal. Before doing so, however, NYSE Euronext must provide Duetsche Börse five business days to match Nasdaq’s offer. If Deutsche Börse matches, then the whole process is reset and Deutsche Börse is given a new five day opportunity to match. The operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange thus has an advantage over Nasdaq if it wants to get into a bidding war. Moreover, the acquisition agreement contains a “force the vote” provision. NYSE Euronext cannot terminate the acquisition agreement and, if Deutsche Börse demands it, NYSE Euronext must put the Deutsche Börse deal up to a vote of NYSE Euronext shareholders. This would drag out the contest, something that is certainly within Deutsche Börse’s rights. Nasdaq, which is being advised by longtime deal-makers John A. Marzulli Jr. and Robert Katz at Shearman &amp; Sterling, will need time to obtain regulatory approvals so it may not care as much. If Deutsche Börse requires a vote, NYSE Euronext would have to wait until its shareholders voted down the deal to agree to be acquired by Nasdaq. Only then could NYSE Euronext enter into a deal with Nasdaq, an event which would require NYSE Euronext to pay a termination fee of 250 million euros to Deutsche Börse. But all of this assumes that NYSE Euronext board wants to sell. It currently is engaging in a strategic combination with Deutsche Börse. Because this is a stock-for-stock merger and not a sale of NYSE Euronext, the NYSE Euronext board is not subject to so-called Revlon duties that require the board to obtain the highest price reasonably available when a company is sold. Since Revlon duties do not apply, the NYSE Euronext board can resist the Nasdaq bid and assert that more long-term value will be provided to its shareholders through a strategic combination with Deutsche Börse. NYSE Euronext shareholders can still reject the Deutsche Börse deal even if the NYSE Euronext board still supports it. But if the NYSE Euronext board wants to be aggressive it can do what happened in the merger of Time and Warner Communications in 1989. In that deal, the parties flipped a strategic stock for stock combination into a cash acquisition of Warner by Time in order to fight off a hostile bid for Time by Paramount. Cash acquisitions do not normally require a shareholder vote by the acquiring company’s shareholders and so Time was able to complete the combination via this route. In this situation Deutsche Börse would have to agree to the conversion to a pure acquisition and NYSE Euronext would have to obtain cash financing, but in such a circumstance no vote of NYSE Euronext shareholders would be required. This would be a very aggressive maneuver though, something not attempted by a major company since the Time/Warner deal. Look to see the route the NYSE Euronext board takes in response to this bid. If the board declares that the Nasdaq offer could lead to a superior proposal, something fairly obvious right now, it likely means that the board has decided to auction the company, subject to obtaining satisfaction on any regulatory issues. But if the board refuses to even contemplate the Nasdaq proposal, it is looking either to complete the Deutsch Börse deal or remain independent. Of course, the market may successfully demand that the NYSE Euronext board negotiate, but the board will be guided by the goal posts set by its acquisition agreement and Delaware law. Steven M.

Their long-awaited offer formally sets off a fight for NYSE, as exchange operators around the world seek merger partners to better compete on a global scale. The Nasdaq-ICE deal would merge the two biggest stock exchange operators in the United States, creating a new national champion for stock listings at a time when American markets fear losing ground to foreign rivals. It would also shore up Nasdaq’s business, which has been fending off upstart competitors like Bats and DirectEdge that advertise their high-speed electronic trading systems. “The bid today is entirely consistent with our long-stated goal of matching massive scale with extreme efficiency,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chairman and chief executive, said on Friday in a conference call with analysts. “This plan recognizes the global nature of the listing competition.” Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press Release DealBook: Robert Greifeld of Nasdaq Nasdaq and ICE collectively expect about $740 million in cost savings three years after the deal closes, a figure driven by cutting jobs and eliminating duplicate back-end systems. Nasdaq plans to close either NYSE’s data center or its own. “Not only are the synergies more significant, and there’s more cash composition. But we believe we can create a company that better competes in today’s markets,” Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE’s chairman and chief executive, said on the call. Under the terms of the bid, Nasdaq would take over the Big Board and other domestic stock-related businesses, while ICE would acquire NYSE’s derivatives unit, known as Liffe. The combined Nasdaq NYSE would be called “Nasdaq NYSE Euronext” and would maintain both the Big Board’s famed floor operations and Nasdaq’s own electronic trading platform. Under the terms of their bid, Nasdaq and ICE would pay $42.50 for each NYSE share, consisting of $14.24 in cash, 0.4069 shares in Nasdaq and 0.1436 shares in ICE. The offer trumps Deutsche Börse’s $35.29-a-share all-stock bid and is 27 percent higher than NYSE’s share price on Feb. 8, the day before it disclosed merger talks with the German market operator. NYSE said in a statement that it would review the Nasdaq-ICE proposal. Nasdaq began considering a potential counterbid shortly after NYSE disclosed negotiations with Deutsche Börse, quickly hiring advisers and reaching out to potential merger partners like ICE and the CME Group, according to people briefed on the matter. It had also considered taking part in the separate merger of the London and Toronto stock exchanges. Nasdaq and ICE spent weeks negotiating an agreement over how to carve up NYSE. Mr. Greifeld was the more aggressive of the chief executives in pushing for a deal, and he worked to convince Mr. Sprecher of both the need for a counterproposal and the likelihood that they could win. “What we have been working on over the past month is spending a tremendous amount of time together, trying to understand the business we would be acquiring,” Mr. Sprecher said. The bid may be the biggest test yet for Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Sprecher as deal makers. Both Nasdaq and ICE have struck a number of deals over the last five years, and Nasdaq in particular has been praised by analysts for its ability to quickly digest its acquisitions and reap cost savings. But both Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Sprecher have at least one prominent deal failure. Nasdaq unsuccessfully sought to acquire the London Stock Exchange, though it sold its holdings in the British company at a profit, and ICE lost a race to buy the Chicago Board of Trade to CME. Shares in Deutsche Börse closed on Friday at 52.81 euros, or $74.83. Shares in NYSE jumped 12.6 percent, to $39.60, while Nasdaq stock rose 9.25 percent, to $28.23. Shares in ICE fell 3.1 percent, to $119.75. Nasdaq and ICE are hoping in part to seize upon fears that NYSE’s deal with Deutsche Börse will erode New York’s standing as a global financial capital. Several lawmakers have said that they are worried about a German company taking over an American financial icon, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York has implied that his support for that deal depends in part on retaining the NYSE name as part of the newly combined company. Deutsche Börse and NYSE have argued that theirs is a merger of equals, with top management drawn from both sides of the Atlantic and dual headquarters in Frankfurt and New York City. Reto Francioni of Deutsche Börse would become chairman of the new company, while Duncan Niederauer of NYSE would take the chief executive role. Nasdaq and ICE must contend with their own numerous hurdles, including probable antitrust concerns over combining the two biggest stock market operators in the United States. It may also generate fears about job losses, given that both NYSE and Nasdaq are based in New York City. “I’m concerned about how this deal affects jobs in New York,” Senator Schumer said in an e-mail. “I have asked Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Sprecher to send me details on the jobs impact of their proposed deal and what ramifications it would have for the New York work force.” Then there are the financial ramifications. If they succeed, Nasdaq and ICE would need to split a roughly $355 million breakup fee payable to Deutsche Börse, what Mr. Greifeld called a “generous gift.” Neither he nor Mr. Sprecher elaborated on how the two companies would determine how much of the fee each would pay. The deal, which the companies will pay for with existing cash and $3.8 billion in financing, would also burden Nasdaq with additional debt. Its books are already saddled with $2.2 billion in debt. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the outlook for Nasdaq’s credit rating to negative from stable on Friday, citing the debt the company would take on from the transaction. “Nasdaq OMX has a track record of successfully integrating acquisitions, but the proposed transaction is of such a size, scope and visibility that it will undoubtedly present unique execution challenges,” Peter Nerby, a Moody’s senior vice president, wrote in a research note. Mr. Greifeld said he expected to quickly pay down the debt load with the cash generated by the newly combined company. Afterward, Nasdaq plans to pay out dividends and buy back stock. Nasdaq is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Evercore Partners and the law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling. ICE is being advised by Lazard, Broadhaven Capital Partners, BMO Capital Markets and the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/as-nasdaq-weighs-nyse-bid-big-hurdles-remain/?ref=nyseeuronext">As Nasdaq Weighs NYSE Bid, Big Hurdles Remain<date>March 14, 2011, 7:53 pm</date><text>Ramin Talaie/Bloomberg NewsRobert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX Group. 8:42 p.m. | Updated In an effort to stay relevant amid a wave of exchange deals, the Nasdaq OMX Group is moving closer to a rival bid for NYSE Euronext, one that could break up the Big Board operator’s planned merger with Deutsche Börse, according to people briefed on the matter. Nasdaq, which has been studying its potential response to the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal, is in talks to raise up to $5 billion in debt financing from several banks and other sources of capital, these people said. Any Nasdaq bid would count on the IntercontinentalExchange buying several parts of NYSE’s businesses, notably the Liffe European derivatives trading business, these people said. While a bid may come as soon as this week, Nasdaq could decide against proceeding with an unsolicited bid, these people said. It is also considering its options in a potential alliance with the London Stock Exchange, which has agreed to a separate merger with the Toronto Stock Exchange. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink A spokesman for Nasdaq declined to comment. News of the company’s financing efforts was first reported by DealReporter. No matter which path it chooses, Nasdaq finds itself hard pressed to stay alone as its competitors bulk up through a series of mergers. The planned combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse will create a powerful trans-Atlantic market titan with significant operations in the trading of stock, options and derivatives. Under Robert Greifeld, its chief executive, Nasdaq has pursued some international expansion, including the 2007 acquisition of OMX, which operates seven European exchanges, for about $3.7 billion. But it has stumbled on occasion, notably with a failed hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange. Analysts say they believe that the latest wave of mergers will leave Nasdaq vulnerable in a business that has long followed the maxim that bigger is better. Through its own series of mergers, NYSE Euronext has moved away from stock listings, adding on more lucrative operations like futures, options and derivatives trading. It has also established a significant presence in Europe, one that it plans to bolster through a merger with Deutsche Börse. Nasdaq is hoping in part to draw upon concerns that NYSE Euronext is being swallowed up by a larger foreign competitor, de-emphasizing New York’s standing as a global financial capital. Executives at NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have sought to tamp down such fears, calling their deal a merger of equals. In pursuing NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq still must grapple with several challenges. It has not yet settled terms of an agreement with IntercontinentalExchange, one of these people said. It would also have to contend with a high $350 million break-up fee in the NYSE Euronext deal with Deutsche Börse. And while Nasdaq is likely to find the debt financing needed for a break-up bid, it would leave the company bearing a high level of debt. It had nearly $2.18 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2010, nearly five times its annual earnings of $395 million. The company could also face antitrust scrutiny, given that it would put together the two biggest stock listings companies in the United States.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/a-new-breed-of-markets/?ref=nyseeuronext">A New Breed of Markets<date>March 1, 2011, 2:40 pm</date><text>When the operators of the New York and Frankfurt stock exchanges announced a merger last month, it was the latest example of consolidation among the world’s financial markets.

J. Crew Buyout Dispute: The go-shop process for J. Crew has ended with no alternative bids to the retailer’s proposed leveraged buyout. This is not surprising. The initial J. Crew go-shop was similarly fruitless and the retailer’s chief executive, Millard S. Drexler, who is taking part in the buyout, appears less than willing to work with other bidders despite having signed an agreement to assist them. Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr., during a telephone conference call on Feb. 11, had his first chance to comment on the J. Crew litigation settlement and the shareholder plaintiffs lawyers’ contention that it is now invalid. The vice chancellor stated that he was not going to consider whether the J. Crew settlement is valid or not until after the transaction closes. In addition, he appeared skeptical about the plaintiffs’ claims that J. Crew had violated the settlement agreement. Instead he seemed to view plaintiffs’ claims that J. Crew had violated the settlement as a bargaining attempt to reopen it and seek even better terms. The shareholder vote on the $3 billion buyout by TPG Capital and Leonard Green &amp; Partners is scheduled for March 1. Expect the transaction to close immediately afterward if the deal is approved. It is all up to the shareholders now; more than 50 percent must vote yes plus the majority of the shareholders not affiliated with the buyout group (which by my estimation is about 48 percent of the total stockholders). Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders vote no on the transaction, and we are waiting for Institutional Shareholder Services’ recommendation. According to Capital IQ, the top four shareholders of J. Crew hold approximately 34 percent of the company, so they will likely determine the outcome of the bid. Two of those holders are Paulson &amp; Company (9.4 percent) and Mason Capital Management (6.5 percent). Paulson has filed a Schedule 13G with the Securities and Exchange Commission to report its ownership interest. Shareholders who file this schedule (instead of a Schedule 13D) must remain passive. Thus, while Paulson could, and may very well, vote no, it is unlikely to actively oppose this deal. Schedule 13G filers do not have to disclose the price they paid for their shares, so Paulson may have a good profit. Meanwhile, Mason has stated in a filing that it would oppose the deal and assert appraisal rights under Delaware law. J. Crew shareholders are now faced with a choice: Should they take what is offered despite this poor process? Or should they reject the deal and take their chances with an independent company that is still run by Mr. Drexler. He still owns about $300 million worth of shares and may stay and do what he would otherwise have done for the private shareholders. The board is unlikely to risk the shareholder fury that it would create if J. Crew bought back Mr. Drexler’s shares if the deal cratered, and so he will be given incentives to stay. Meanwhile, if this deal is voted down, it is interesting to note that the leveraged recapitalization that J. Crew and Goldman Sachs considered last year has become significantly more valuable with the loosening of the financial markets in the last month or so. Perhaps Goldman should be asked to rerun the numbers based on the latest quarterly figures (which have yet to be disclosed). Somebody may want to ask J. Crew if it and its bankers have or will rerun those numbers, and if they are going to release the last quarterly numbers before closing the transaction. Finally, given these incentives and the need to lock up these significant shareholders, this deal will have an interesting two weeks despite (or maybe because) of the lack of a settlement. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Reincorporation: Abercrombie’s Ohio express continues, and shareholders are scheduled to vote on the retailer’s reincorporation in Ohio, instead of Delaware on Feb. 28. I’ve been critical of this reincorporation in a post last year and in another earlier this month. My reasons are that this maneuver appears to further entrench the Abercrombie board without appropriate gains to shareholders. The proxy rating agencies have split on their recommendations as to how shareholders should vote. Glass Lewis is recommending that shareholders vote for the reincorporation, while I.S.S. is recommending against it. I.S.S.’s recommendation follows many of the points I made in my writings. I.S.S. states that “[t]he proposed reincorporation is not in the best interests of shareholders because Ohio’s takeover defenses and director liability provisions would represent a diminution in shareholder rights.” Glass Lewis instead agrees with Abercrombie that this is a careful weighing of shareholder rights and that the gains for the company outweigh the losses. I was surprised at the report Glass Lewis issued. So I called the firm to ask if it had consulted with anyone who was familiar with Ohio law in preparing its report. Representatives of Glass Lewis replied that they had relied on their own internal expertise. When I pointed out that Ohio has a constituency statute that allows boards to consider interests other than shareholders, they were not familiar with this point. Glass Lewis subsequently amended their report to include a discussion of this statute and a few other points of Ohio law I had mentioned. Glass Lewis did not change its recommendation. Ultimately, as with most shareholder votes, there is an inherent bias in favor of management’s position. This is a result of the dynamics of proxy voting: shareholders have little interest in the proposals and often blindly follow management. Only a few weeks ago, a reincorporation of Pure Bioscience from California to Delaware was approved despite an I.S.S. recommendation against. There were only 10 reincorporation proposals last year among companies in the Russell 3,000 stock index. But these were small companies where institutional shareholders do not have significant power. In the case of Abercrombie, Capital IQ reports that approximately 72 percent of the shares are owned by institutional investors. We are about to have a field experiment to see what these institutions think of Ohio law, whether I have overstated the case and whether these shareholders agree with Glass Lewis and Abercrombie. NYSE Eurotext-Deutsche Börse Merger: The silly posturing, political and otherwise, over the new name of the merged exchanges, misses a more fundamental point. This deal is being portrayed as a merger of equals. This is a particular type of merger where the parties go to great lengths for the acquisition to be viewed as a partnership. Neither company is acquiring the other. Strategic mergers, particularly mergers of equals often fare poorly. This is particularly true when the tie-up is cross-border because of the complexities of such deals. When things go bad, the reason is typically that executive ego and cultures clash as integration is poorly implemented and no common culture put forth. With no dominant culture, trench warfare instead results as each side tries to dominate the other. One side will ultimately win, and the losing side subsequently feels like a poor stepchild. The consequence is that the intended gains from the acquisition go unrealized. And the need to pay heed to both companies too often means savings are also not realized as dual headquarters and executives are maintained. Even the board in a merger of equals must pay heed to this principle, leaving one far too big — in this case 17 members for the NYSE-Deutsche Börse board. For examples of merger of equals going bad, we can start with Chrysler-Daimler Benz, another American-German tie-up that failed miserably. But you can also look to Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter and AOL-Time Warner. The posturing over the name of this merged exchange is a sign that this is going to be a hard fight to integrate these two and avoid these pitfalls. Meanwhile, Nasdaq OMX and InterContinental Exchange are reported to be considering a counter-bid for NYSE Euronext. NYSE shareholders will get to vote on the Deutsche Börse transaction, and so if they receive an offer from Nasdaq they will get a choice between the two bids, assuming any Nasdaq bid can clear antitrust approval in time. The price will need to be higher, of course, and if an offer is made, it will be framed as an acquisition. NYSE would likely then argue that there are greater long-term strategic benefits from a merger with Deutsche Börse that outweigh a short-term higher price from Nasdaq. If this comes to pass, shareholders should assess those strategic benefits with a wary eye. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: My colleague at the Connecticut School of law, Patricia A. McCoy, was appointed this week to head the mortgage and home equity markets team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The news was subsumed by the appointment of former investment bankers to positions at the bureau. The appointment of financial industry insiders may be a savvy move by bringing in people familiar with the industry to regulate it. While this could create a revolving door and produce an agency that caters to the financial industry, the real question is whether Elizabeth Warren, the bureau’s head, can create an environment where the regulators can be independent and avoid these pitfalls. The appointment of Patricia McCoy is a good sign. She is the co-author of an excellent book, “The Subprime Virus,” which explores the role of predatory lending and subprime mortgages in the financial crisis. She is also a former law partner and an eminently reasonable person. Mortgages will be one of the most important financial products that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau focuses on, and so this appointment has not gotten the attention it deserves. Deal Structure: The acquisition agreement for the $3.2 billion acquisition of Emergency Medical Services by Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice has been filed. The reverse termination fee payable by Clayton Dubilier is $203,884,000, or 6.4 percent of the transaction value. The termination fee payable by E.M.S. is $116,505,000, or 3.6 percent of transaction value. The termination fee is payable to Clayton Dubilier if E.M.S. accepts a third-party bid. E.M.S. can obtain specific performance of the deal — that is, force Clayton Dubilier to complete the transaction. But E.M.S. cannot force Clayton Dubilier itself to fund the transaction unless the banks provide the debt financing. If specific performance is unavailable or Clayton Dubilier fails to close, then E.M.S. can terminate the deal and collect the reverse termination fee. This is rapidly becoming the normative structure of private equity. More interestingly, strategic buyers continue to push optionality in their deals. In RehabCare’s purchase by Kindred Healthcare, the acquisition agreement has a very optional financing condition, despite this being a cash and stock transaction. In consolation, there is a sizable reverse termination fee of $62 million. Massey Energy’s acquisition by Alpha Natural Resources has a structure similar to the Emergency Medical Services deal, with a financing failure out and reverse termination fee of $360 million that is payable upon such event. Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton was counsel for both buyers. What I find so interesting about this is that even with fabulous credit markets, buyers are asking for and receiving financing outs. The lessons of the financial crisis are sticking. Airgas and the Defeat of Air Products and Chemicals: Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz has taken its victory lap and you can read about it here. Meanwhile, The AmLaw Daily has named Marc Wolinsky of Wachtell litigator of the week for his three-and-a-half-hour closing argument in the case for Airgas (which included a clip from “A Streetcar Named Desire”). Almost everyone agreed that Airgas had little chance of losing. Not exactly an endorsement for succinct debating. Del Monte Foods Buyout: In light of the stinging opinion issued by Vice Chancellor J.

Bid<date>February 18, 2011, 12:46 pm</date><text>8:24 p.m. | Updated The wave of recent exchange mergers, including the proposed union of the operators of the New York and Frankfurt stock exchanges, may not be over yet, as others seek ways to join the action. Two of the most prominent American markets operators, Nasdaq OMX and the Intercontinental Exchange, known as ICE, are in talks to team up on a takeover bid for NYSE Euronext, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday. The goal is stopping the company’s merger with Deutsche Börse, a deal that would create a trans-Atlantic colossus. The CME Group, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, has hired bankers and is studying its own options, people briefed on the matter said. Under the terms of the discussions between Nasdaq and ICE, Nasdaq would most likely take over NYSE Euronext’s cash equities business, including the New York Stock Exchange’s famed Big Board and its cadre of floor specialists, this person said. ICE would probably claim NYSE Euronext’s expansive derivatives business. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Talks between Nasdaq and ICE are continuing, and any offer may not emerge for several weeks, this person said, cautioning that the chances of a real counterbid for NYSE Euronext are low. This person spoke only on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. Representatives for Nasdaq, ICE, CME and NYSE Euronext declined to comment. Shares in Nasdaq rose 1.3 percent on Friday, to $29.09, giving the company a market value of $5.76 billion. Shares in ICE fell 1.3 percent, to $127.18, giving it market value of $9.33 billion. Shares in NYSE Euronext rose 2.2 percent, to $37.79, giving it a market value of $9.86 billion. The talks by Nasdaq, ICE and CME reflect concern about how market operators must respond to the changing landscape of modern finance. Buffeted by upstart electronic competitors and demand for greater international services, traditional exchange companies have sought to find ways to gain scale and services. The proposed merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse looms large over this world: the union would create a powerful new trans-Atlantic market with big presences in the trading of stocks, options and derivatives. Other markets have disclosed plans to combine recently. Last week, the London and Toronto stock exchanges came out with their own merger proposal, which would create a new market for mining and natural resource stocks. And on Friday, BATS, one of the most successful American stock exchanges, completed its deal to buy Chi-X Europe to bolster its Europe presence. Analysts have said that CBOE Holdings, which runs the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and big international market operators, like the BM&amp;F Bovespa in Brazil, would also explore potential partnerships or mergers. But analysts have identified Nasdaq as the market operator left most vulnerable by the NYSE Euronext deal, given its smaller size and international footprint. The company hired investment bankers soon after word of the NYSE-Deutsche Börse talks emerged. Beyond a potential bid to break up NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq’s potential options included making a bid for the London Stock Exchange, analysts said. But Nasdaq and ICE would need to jump several large hurdles to make a bid for NYSE Euronext. The Big Board operator’s deal with Deutsche Börse includes a $340 million break-up fee in the event the deal is scuttled by a new bidder. And there are other potential problems, including tax issues. The talks between Nasdaq and ICE were reported on Thursday by Fox Business Network. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 23, 2011 An article on Saturday about a possible joint bid by Nasdaq and the Intercontinental Exchange for NYSE Euronext misstated part of the name of the news entity that first reported the talks.

Now the home team looks in danger of letting one slip away. The Mets owner, Fred Wilpon, will probably struggle to find someone to buy a 25 percent stake in the team to ease his financial burden. But a solution may be no further than the Citi Field bleachers: an initial public offering of the Mets. It is not clear whether a partial sale would help Mr. Wilpon. He and his partner are accused by the trustee cleaning up Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi mess of receiving $300 million of fictional gains. That is about a third of the estimated value of the Mets, according to Forbes. Yet the trustee wants to recover $1 billion from the team’s owners. Even setting aside the legal complications, there is rarely much interest in owning a small portion of a sports team. Such trophy assets are not usually stellar investments and the lack of control prevents calling the shots in the big leagues. Box seats are a cheaper way to get closer to the action. But one group could see past these obstacles: Mets fans. Selling spectators something more than tickets and beer has produced decent results on and off the field. The community-owned Green Bay Packers just won the Super Bowl. And a British soccer club, the Tottenham Hotspur, not only ranks among the Premier League elite this season, but over the last five years its London-traded shares have increased by 50 percent. If recent history is any guide, Mr. Wilpon could have a sporting chance. More than a dozen British soccer clubs introduced initial public offerings in the mid-1990s, often selling shares at hefty premiums to their fair value. Closer to home for Mr. Wilpon, the Florida Panthers hockey team saw its stock triple after a stock market debut 15 years ago. And even baseball’s Cleveland Indians went public briefly in 1998. These days, Major League Baseball’s executives prefer to scrutinize all new team owners closely, something they could not do for shares sold to thousands of fans. And the disclosure required of a public listing might worry the cloistered group. But by all accounts, Mr. Wilpon is a beloved member of the club. And average attendance across the league has tumbled for three consecutive seasons. As any baseball aficionado knows, teams losing big late in the game could use a home run. Big Board, Literally The merging Big Board is taking its moniker literally. The Deutsche Börse-New York Stock Exchange combination will have a larger-than-usual 17 directors. The average S.&amp;P. 500 company has shrunk its board, to 10.7 last year from 15 members 25 years ago, according to Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm. Potential drivers include pressure to make decision-making more efficient and the reduction in the number of full-time executives sitting on boards in favor of a majority of outside directors. Big financial firms can be different. Even the N.Y.S.E.’s current board has 16 members. That does not necessarily mean its unwieldy size outweighs its value. Though some researchers have concluded large boards coincide with corporate underperformance, a New York Federal Reserve study suggests it is different for big, and often complex, financial institutions. So it may be for the German-American exchange. Though Deutsche Börse’s governance has been on a different model, it has a populous supervisory board of 18, which in turn oversees an executive board of six. Both bourses have complicated and geographically diverse operational webs, so a bigger-than-average board may be justified. The danger is that companies, especially those trying to create the politically safe impression of a merger of relative equals, allow boards to become bloated for the wrong reasons. And big boards can become dysfunctional. That is how John Reed described the 27-strong board of the New York Stock Exchange back in 2003, when he arrived as chairman and it was privately held. There is no single prescription, though shareholders are probably best served by a majority of independent directors who work together but contribute diverse views. Since its initial public offering in 2002, the CME has outperformed both the N.Y.S.E. and Deutsche Börse. It had 20 board members when it went public and now has 32. The wisdom of crowds can sometimes be valuable.

The union of the operators of the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the biggest example of the consolidation among financial markets, as established players contend with smaller electronic platforms that have seized market share. Last week, the London and Toronto stock exchanges announced their own tie-up. In October, SGX, the operator of the Singapore stock exchange, said it planned to buy the Australian stock exchange. By combining, Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext hope to create a giant among financial markets, allowing investors access to thousands of stock listings in the United States and Europe, as well as options, derivatives and other services. They also hope to shore up their positions against upstart electronic platforms that allow faster trading at lower cost. ''This transaction brings together two of the most respected and successful exchange operators in the world to lead the way in global capital markets and set the standard for growth, quality and market reach,'' Reto Francioni, Deutsche Borse's chief executive, said in a statement. But the deal has also stoked fears that New York and its Big Board are ceding prominence as a major financial capital. While both companies say they expect few regulatory issues, the possibility of political interference still hangs over the deal. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said over the weekend that the combined company should place ''New York'' first in its name as an implied requisite for approval. The first question asked at a joint news conference on Tuesday was about the name of the new company. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse have said that they have not agreed upon a name. ''Brands are always an emotional decision,'' Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext's chairman said. ''We hope not to delay the decision too long.'' The Singapore and Australian exchanges said on Tuesday that they had revamped their merger proposal in an attempt to win regulatory support for the $8.4 billion deal. Notably, the combined exchange would have an equal number of Australian and Singaporean citizens on its 13-member board, with five for each nation and three international directors. With the new terms, SGX hopes to overcome the qualms of Australia's political and business worlds, which fear that control would slip away from Sydney. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse sealed their deal on Tuesday morning after votes by their boards. ''This transaction is a catalyst for the development of a global capital markets community, delivering the best, most transparent and innovative services for clients and issuers, wherever they are,'' Mr. Niederauer said. Under the terms of the deal, Deutsche Borse will issue 0.47 of a share for each NYSE Euronext share, a roughly 10 percent premium to the American company's stock price on Feb. 8, before the two announced their talks. The deal values NYSE Euronext at about $10 billion. Mr. Francioni of Deutsche Borse will be chairman of the combined company, while Mr. Niederauer of NYSE Euronext will be chief executive. Deutsche Borse will hold 10 seats on the 17-seat board of the combined company, because its shareholders own about 60 percent of the merged exchange operator's shares. Yet American investors are expected to be the biggest shareholders in the combined company, with a combined 55 percent stake. German shareholders will most likely make up only a small fraction of the company's total investor base. NYSE Euronext executives will hold major management positions, including those of chief operating officer, head of global information technology and general counsel. The combined company will have dual headquarters in New York and Frankfurt, though it will be incorporated in the Netherlands. More than $400 million in annual cost savings are expected from the deal. The merger of the New York and German exchanges requires approval by owners representing a majority of NYSE Euronext shares and 75 percent of Deutsche Borse shareholders. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. Jack Ewing and Chris V. Nicholson contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Merger Deal No Threat to U.S. Markets<date>Published: February 14, 2011</date><text> Americans shouldn’t fear a German takeover of the New York Stock Exchange. Politicians are getting antsy — even about the merged entity’s name — and some may use the deal to criticize last year’s financial legislation. That’s a superficial and illogical response. N.Y.S.E.’s purchase of Euronext didn’t emasculate European markets. And this deal, whose details are expected on Tuesday, won’t ruin America’s. What happens on markets matters more than who owns them. That doesn’t mean Senator Charles Schumer isn’t entitled to insist that the combo put the New York brand first. It’s in his interest to promote his home town as global financial center. And he may have saved the new group some communications consulting fees. The Big Apple and its connotations make for a better brand than the generically Teutonic alternative. But for New York to thrive as a financial center, it needs its backers to move on from an antiquated picture of the Big Board as a floor where burly men wave General Electric share certificates or where only stocks are traded. To retain its role as a financial hub, it must lead in innovation and technology, and above all represent itself as a place where the interests of investors are well served. On its own, N.Y.S.E. Euronext was in danger of losing out in this race. The Nasdaq, Hong Kong and London exchanges challenged it for new listings; the Chicago exchanges led in the innovation of indexes, futures and other derivatives; and rival trading platforms have eroded the profitability of its once-core stock trading business. The Euronext deal in 2007 gave the N.Y.S.E. access to a lucrative European derivatives business, whose operating profits now top those generated by the combined company’s cash trading and listing services. Moreover, because electronic trading has made cash transactions a volume game, a tie-up with Deutsche Börse should channel more business New York’s way. The German group’s Eurex joint venture also owns the International Securities Exchange, a big United States options exchange. The planned partnership — even one where the N.Y.S.E.’s shareholders call only 40 percent of the shots — should bolster New York’s position. Moreover, though exchanges are going global, regulation is still local. That helped overcome parochial sentiment in Europe when the N.Y.S.E. merged with Euronext. Legislators worried about the future should focus more on keeping America’s financial centers on top by promoting fairness, good corporate governance and impeccable transparency. A name, after all, is just a name. Swiss Secrecy Switzerland just made life more difficult for despots. The country’s decision to freeze assets belonging to Hosni Mubarak smacks of hypocrisy: after all, the former Egyptian president and his family have long been accused by critics of enriching themselves at the country’s expense. But in the absence of a global deal to stop heads of state from exporting the spoils of office, Switzerland’s approach is better than nothing. A few weeks earlier, Switzerland also froze all potential assets belonging to Tunisia’s former president. It’s not clear what the Mubarak clan might have squirreled away. It’s also not certain what proportion of the purported fortune is stashed in Switzerland. Nevertheless, the country’s decision seems rather late. If the Swiss — and other countries — were really serious about state-sponsored looting, shouldn’t they refuse to accept suspect deposits in the first place? In practice, it’s hard to bar banks from doing business with a sitting head of state, particularly one that’s a close ally of the United States. Financial sanctions have made it harder for international pariahs like North Korea and Iran to access the financial system. But not all corrupt dictators face the same constraints. A global rule preventing heads of state from moving more than a certain sum abroad while in office would do the trick. Politicians who had nothing to hide would have little to fear from such a regime. However, there’s little prospect of such an accord being agreed to, let alone properly enforced. Switzerland’s latest move is unlikely to have despots quaking in their palaces. Alleged kleptocrats may simply move their money to less choosy jurisdictions in the Gulf or Asia. Even so, Switzerland has traditionally been seen as a safe haven for heads of state looking to hide their wealth. If freezing assets makes life even a little bit less comfortable, that is very welcome. ROB COX, AGNES T.

Though Deutsche Börse’s governance has been on a different model, it has a populous supervisory board of 18, which in turn oversees an executive board of six. Both bourses have complicated and geographically diverse operational webs, so a bigger-than-average board may be justified. The danger is that companies, especially those trying to create the politically safe impression of a merger of relative equals, allow boards to become bloated for the wrong reasons. And big boards can become dysfunctional. That is how John Reed described the 27-strong board of the New York Stock Exchange back in 2003, when he arrived as chairman and it was privately held. There is no single prescription, though shareholders are probably best served by a majority of independent directors who work together but contribute diverse views. Since its initial public offering in 2002, the CME has outperformed both the N.Y.S.E. and Deutsche Börse. It had 20 board members when it went public and now has 32. The wisdom of crowds can sometimes be valuable.

The union of the operators of the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the biggest example of the consolidation among financial markets, as established players contend with smaller electronic platforms that have seized market share. Last week, the London and Toronto stock exchanges announced their own tie-up. In October, SGX, the operator of the Singapore stock exchange, said it planned to buy the Australian stock exchange. By combining, Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext hope to create a giant among financial markets, allowing investors access to thousands of stock listings in the United States and Europe, as well as options, derivatives and other services. They also hope to shore up their positions against upstart electronic platforms that allow faster trading at lower cost. ''This transaction brings together two of the most respected and successful exchange operators in the world to lead the way in global capital markets and set the standard for growth, quality and market reach,'' Reto Francioni, Deutsche Borse's chief executive, said in a statement. But the deal has also stoked fears that New York and its Big Board are ceding prominence as a major financial capital. While both companies say they expect few regulatory issues, the possibility of political interference still hangs over the deal. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said over the weekend that the combined company should place ''New York'' first in its name as an implied requisite for approval. The first question asked at a joint news conference on Tuesday was about the name of the new company. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse have said that they have not agreed upon a name. ''Brands are always an emotional decision,'' Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext's chairman said. ''We hope not to delay the decision too long.'' The Singapore and Australian exchanges said on Tuesday that they had revamped their merger proposal in an attempt to win regulatory support for the $8.4 billion deal. Notably, the combined exchange would have an equal number of Australian and Singaporean citizens on its 13-member board, with five for each nation and three international directors. With the new terms, SGX hopes to overcome the qualms of Australia's political and business worlds, which fear that control would slip away from Sydney. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse sealed their deal on Tuesday morning after votes by their boards. ''This transaction is a catalyst for the development of a global capital markets community, delivering the best, most transparent and innovative services for clients and issuers, wherever they are,'' Mr. Niederauer said. Under the terms of the deal, Deutsche Borse will issue 0.47 of a share for each NYSE Euronext share, a roughly 10 percent premium to the American company's stock price on Feb. 8, before the two announced their talks. The deal values NYSE Euronext at about $10 billion. Mr. Francioni of Deutsche Borse will be chairman of the combined company, while Mr. Niederauer of NYSE Euronext will be chief executive. Deutsche Borse will hold 10 seats on the 17-seat board of the combined company, because its shareholders own about 60 percent of the merged exchange operator's shares. Yet American investors are expected to be the biggest shareholders in the combined company, with a combined 55 percent stake. German shareholders will most likely make up only a small fraction of the company's total investor base. NYSE Euronext executives will hold major management positions, including those of chief operating officer, head of global information technology and general counsel. The combined company will have dual headquarters in New York and Frankfurt, though it will be incorporated in the Netherlands. More than $400 million in annual cost savings are expected from the deal. The merger of the New York and German exchanges requires approval by owners representing a majority of NYSE Euronext shares and 75 percent of Deutsche Borse shareholders. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. Jack Ewing and Chris V. Nicholson contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Merger Deal No Threat to U.S. Markets<date>Published: February 14, 2011</date><text> Americans shouldn’t fear a German takeover of the New York Stock Exchange. Politicians are getting antsy — even about the merged entity’s name — and some may use the deal to criticize last year’s financial legislation. That’s a superficial and illogical response. N.Y.S.E.’s purchase of Euronext didn’t emasculate European markets. And this deal, whose details are expected on Tuesday, won’t ruin America’s. What happens on markets matters more than who owns them. That doesn’t mean Senator Charles Schumer isn’t entitled to insist that the combo put the New York brand first. It’s in his interest to promote his home town as global financial center. And he may have saved the new group some communications consulting fees. The Big Apple and its connotations make for a better brand than the generically Teutonic alternative. But for New York to thrive as a financial center, it needs its backers to move on from an antiquated picture of the Big Board as a floor where burly men wave General Electric share certificates or where only stocks are traded. To retain its role as a financial hub, it must lead in innovation and technology, and above all represent itself as a place where the interests of investors are well served. On its own, N.Y.S.E. Euronext was in danger of losing out in this race. The Nasdaq, Hong Kong and London exchanges challenged it for new listings; the Chicago exchanges led in the innovation of indexes, futures and other derivatives; and rival trading platforms have eroded the profitability of its once-core stock trading business. The Euronext deal in 2007 gave the N.Y.S.E. access to a lucrative European derivatives business, whose operating profits now top those generated by the combined company’s cash trading and listing services. Moreover, because electronic trading has made cash transactions a volume game, a tie-up with Deutsche Börse should channel more business New York’s way. The German group’s Eurex joint venture also owns the International Securities Exchange, a big United States options exchange. The planned partnership — even one where the N.Y.S.E.’s shareholders call only 40 percent of the shots — should bolster New York’s position. Moreover, though exchanges are going global, regulation is still local. That helped overcome parochial sentiment in Europe when the N.Y.S.E. merged with Euronext. Legislators worried about the future should focus more on keeping America’s financial centers on top by promoting fairness, good corporate governance and impeccable transparency. A name, after all, is just a name. Swiss Secrecy Switzerland just made life more difficult for despots. The country’s decision to freeze assets belonging to Hosni Mubarak smacks of hypocrisy: after all, the former Egyptian president and his family have long been accused by critics of enriching themselves at the country’s expense. But in the absence of a global deal to stop heads of state from exporting the spoils of office, Switzerland’s approach is better than nothing. A few weeks earlier, Switzerland also froze all potential assets belonging to Tunisia’s former president. It’s not clear what the Mubarak clan might have squirreled away. It’s also not certain what proportion of the purported fortune is stashed in Switzerland. Nevertheless, the country’s decision seems rather late. If the Swiss — and other countries — were really serious about state-sponsored looting, shouldn’t they refuse to accept suspect deposits in the first place? In practice, it’s hard to bar banks from doing business with a sitting head of state, particularly one that’s a close ally of the United States. Financial sanctions have made it harder for international pariahs like North Korea and Iran to access the financial system. But not all corrupt dictators face the same constraints. A global rule preventing heads of state from moving more than a certain sum abroad while in office would do the trick. Politicians who had nothing to hide would have little to fear from such a regime. However, there’s little prospect of such an accord being agreed to, let alone properly enforced. Switzerland’s latest move is unlikely to have despots quaking in their palaces. Alleged kleptocrats may simply move their money to less choosy jurisdictions in the Gulf or Asia. Even so, Switzerland has traditionally been seen as a safe haven for heads of state looking to hide their wealth. If freezing assets makes life even a little bit less comfortable, that is very welcome. ROB COX, AGNES T.

Not surprisingly, both companies brought in a cadre of advisers to help put the deal together. NYSE Euronext was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners and BNP Paribas and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz; Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy; and the Dutch firm Stibbe. Deutsche Börse was advised by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Linklaters. The NYSE Euronext assignment is a big achievement for Perella Weinberg, the boutique co-founded in 2006 by Joseph R. Perella. (Several bankers at much larger institutions have expressed surprise at how the firm leapfrogged over them to get the assignment.) The firm has snagged advisory roles in several major deals since its founding, including Wachovia’s sale in 2008 to Wells Fargo and the Pepsi Bottling Group’s takeover by Pepsico in 2009. But several of its most recent major deals — like the leveraged buyouts of J.Crew and Del Monte, the sale of Massey Energy to Alpha Natural Resources and Qwest Communications‘ merger with CenturyTel — have been advising company boards, a less-lucrative role. Deutsche Börse’s advisory team poses fewer surprises, with Deutsche Bank serving as a natural lead adviser alongside JPMorgan. Yet the joint news release on Tuesday also mentioned other firms that provided “further financial advice.” In this case, Credit Suisse and Société Générale were additional advisers to Detusche Börse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley worked for NYSE Euronext, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. (Morgan Stanley already has a piece of two other exchange mergers. It is advising the London Stock Exchange in its deal with the Toronto Stock Exchange, and Singapore’s SGX in its acquisition of Australia’s ASX.) Why bring in the additional help? It’s possible that NYSE Euronext was doing a favor to Goldman and Morgan, two of its most important customers. Beyond the advisory fees, the two firms would also receive credit in the all-important league tables. But it’s also possible that NYSE Euronext may want the two firms around if a potential rival bidder, like the CME Group, emerges. Other banks have been studying ways to get a piece of the action, people briefed on the matter have told DealBook, though it’s unclear whether anything concrete will take shape.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE2DF1239F937A25751C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=nyseeuronext">Deal on NYSE-Deutsche Börse Nears<date>Published: February 14, 2011</date><text>Senator Charles E. Schumer signaled on Sunday that he might support a merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse -- so long as the New York Stock Exchange's name comes first in the combined company. Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that he had met with Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext's chief executive, on Friday and Saturday to speak about the potential deal. Chief among the senator's requirements is whether the deal will ''keep New York on top as the financial center of the world.'' Under the proposed terms of the merger, both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse would have equal representation on the combined company's board, and the merged exchange would have dual headquarters in New York and Frankfurt. Reto Francioni, Deutsche Borse's chief executive, would become chairman of the combined company, while Mr. Niederauer would be chief executive. NYSE Euronext's board met on Sunday to discuss the state of merger talks with Deutsche Borse, in anticipation of a deal being announced on Tuesday, according to a person briefed on the matter. But one thing has yet to be resolved: the merged company's name. And Mr. Schumer insisted that the New York Stock Exchange's name must come first. ''The New York Stock Exchange is one of the most trusted, preeminent brands in the financial world, with cachet that money simply cannot buy,'' he said. ''It would not be in the best interests of the combined company to dilute that brand.'' (Other politicians, including Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, have also demanded that the N.Y.S.E. keep its name.) Despite reports on Saturday that the combined company was leaning toward the name ''DB NYSE Group,'' the two exchanges would most likely not announce a new name until after the merger was announced, according to people briefed on the matter. One possibility is that the new company would have a more generic name -- though all the local exchanges, including the N.Y.S.E., would retain their names. Here is the statement from Mr. Schumer: On Friday, I met with NYSE Euronext C.E.O. Duncan Niederauer to receive an update on the company's proposed merger with Deutsche Borse. I spoke with Duncan again yesterday. I intend to consider any potential deal from the same perspective that I always use: will it keep New York on top as the financial center of the world? In talking to Duncan, there are so far a number of things to like about a potential deal, as it is currently being discussed: It will enhance N.Y.S.E.'s global competitiveness in a rapidly evolving trading industry, especially by giving the company a platform in the important derivatives business. N.Y.S.E. and Deutsche Borse would be equally represented on the management committee. It will give managerial control of the new operation to the team from N.Y.S.E., with Mr. Niederauer installed as the new C.E.O. Job losses would be minimized. It appears the boards could vote on a potential deal very soon. I will continue monitoring the negotiations, and will reserve judgment until a final announcement is made. But let me say in advance that a key factor to consider in judging this deal will be its implementation. For instance, a sticking point that could emerge, even after a deal is announced, is the name of the new entity. From what I am told, the two sides are actively negotiating over this issue, but so far they haven't come to agreement. Some may say what's in a name, but I say a lot. The New York Stock Exchange is a symbol of national prestige, and its brand must not suffer under this merger. The New York Stock Exchange is the cradle of American capitalism. It is a national treasure. In America, we start each day in our Congress and in our classrooms with the Pledge of Allegiance, and we also start it with the ringing of the bell on the floor of the stock exchange. When the stock exchange reopened after the September 11 attacks, it was a symbol of an entire nation rising back to its feet. The New York Stock Exchange has stood tall during world wars, and even a Depression. It must be preserved after this deal, and it must be preserved with its name intact. Keeping N.Y.S.E. first in the name is the right thing to do from a business perspective as well. The New York Stock Exchange is the one of the most trusted, preeminent brands in the financial world, with cachet that money simply cannot buy. It would not be in the best interests of the combined company to dilute that brand. It is totally logical to keep the N.Y.S.E. name first. If for some reason, the Germans sought an alternative option, it could be an indication that they are trying to wield an upper hand in the new company and would seek to make other business decisions that could go against New York. The name is an important bellwether of whether this deal is regarded as a merger of equals. The name of the new company will be a critical factor in determining support for this merger, both in the regulatory review process as well as in the court of public opinion. It should be resolved sooner rather than later. If this deal is going to keep New York first in the financial world, it must start by keeping New York first in the name.

Shares in several exchange companies, including Nasdaq OMX, the CME Group and CBOE Holdings jumped on Thursday, one day after the New York Stock Exchange's owner, NYSE Euronext, disclosed that it was in advanced deal talks with Deutsche Borse. Also on Wednesday, the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange disclosed that they had reached a deal to combine, creating another major trans-Atlantic markets player. Investors and analysts appeared to be betting that the already-competitive exchange sector would experience another wave of consolidations as the owners of these markets sought to expand internationally and bolster positions in lucrative businesses like derivatives trading. High on the list of potential deal makers are Nasdaq; CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade; and CBOE, which runs the Chicago Board Options Exchange. ''The CME, the CBOE and Nasdaq are now forced to make their next move,'' said Patrick J. Healy, the chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group, a New York-based adviser to companies on listing their shares. For years, the watchword within the sector has been that bigger is better, in terms of both scale and services. The big exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq have been moving away from the simple listing and trading of stocks into more lucrative areas like futures, options and derivatives trading. And once their operators have hit the break-even point after building out their platforms, every additional dollar is largely profit. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse said on Wednesday that they expected about $411 million in cost savings through their potential union. ''These are essentially plumbing systems,'' Niamh Alexander, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said. ''You typically need only one set of pipes to carry out trades.'' The merger of NYSE Euronext, whose Big Board and scores of floor brokers have long been a potent symbol of American capitalism, and Deutsche Borse, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, will certainly create a big new international giant. Industry executives say that combining the two will yield a company that is strong in American and European equities, derivatives and trading technology. Despite potential concerns about regulatory and political hurdles, the deal already has one prominent backer. ''I think it's very good for New York,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Thursday. ''You'll have the two strongest stock exchanges together, and it's going to give us access to Europe and them access to the United States in a ways that some of our other competitors, like London, will not have.'' The question for exchanges like Nasdaq and CME is where to find partners. Nasdaq's last major deal was the 2007 purchase of OMX, a collection of seven Scandinavian exchanges, for $3.7 billion. And CME itself was born of several unions, including that of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange a year later. Among the main considerations for the exchanges is the kind of growth they should seek through a deal. Gaining access international markets - especially Asia and Latin America - is considered a high priority, as is increasing market share in higher-margin businesses like derivatives trading. Among Nasdaq's potential merger partners or acquisition targets is CBOE, which would significantly raise its profile in services like options and indexes, according to a research note by Patrick O'Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James. Analysts also said that BATS, an upstart electronic exchange that has seized a big portion of the domestic equities market, may be a possible target. Nasdaq may also seek to break up the London Stock Exchange's proposed merger with its Toronto counterpart. And CME may also seek to grow internationally. The Hong Kong Exchange has signaled its openness to a deal, and other exchanges, including those in Brazil and India, may seek their own tie-ups as well. Representatives for Nasdaq and CME declined to comment. But it was not clear that even Wednesday's deal news would prompt a near-term flurry of exchange mergers. Mr. O'Shaughnessy wrote that such mergers were difficult to complete, and that potential buyers and sellers were more likely to be patient before leaping into another round of consolidation. Potential merger partners, like a combined London-Toronto stock exchange or a Singapore-Australia exchange, are themselves in the middle of pending deals. ''It simply isn't going to be the case that all the world's exchanges are going to pair up in the next few months to leave slowpokes standing on the sidelines without a partner,'' he wrote.

In addition to the United States and Germany, the merged entity would have exchange operations in 12 European nations. Despite this very multinational prospect for the bedrock of the New York financial center, one thing would remain the same — American money. Half of the 10 biggest active shareholders of the Deutsche Börse are United States institutional investors, according to Thomson Reuters data; Franklin Mutual Advisers, the top investor, holds a 4.22 percent stake. And of the other five on the list, two are British subsidiaries of American investment companies.

Of the combined $13.8 billion institutional ownership of the two companies, $6.5 billion of that is held by investors with stakes in both companies. One investor, in particular, has a lot riding on the recent wave of consolidation in exchanges. Norges Bank Investment Management owns shares in both Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext ,as well as in the London and Toronto stock exchanges, which agreed to merge on Wednesday. Norges Bank — which oversees the international investments of Norway’s $443 billion sovereign wealth fund — has $413 million invested across the four exchanges. About $321 million of that is in the Deutsche Börse.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/n-y-s-e-must-keep-its-name-says-congressman/?ref=nyseeuronext">N.Y.S.E. Must Keep Its Name, Florida Congressman Says<date>February 10, 2011, 9:17 am</date><text>Many details of the planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse need to be ironed out. But one American legislator is already making one demand: the New York Stock Exchange must keep its name. Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, said on Thursday that the exchange must retain the name it has had since 1863. “The New York Stock Exchange is a foundation of the extraordinary American economic success story, and its name rightfully reflects the United States’ position as the financial center of the world,” Mr. Deutch said in a statement. As DealBook previously noted, if a deal is reached, it could still face several hurdles, including regulatory and political resistance. New York City leaders have been particularly vocal about maintaining the city’s status as the leading financial capital. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have yet to figure out a name for the combined company, which would be incorporated in the Netherlands and have headquarters in New York and Frankfurt. But all local exchanges — including, yes, the New York Stock Exchange — would retain their names, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook. Mr. Deutch, who was elected to represent Florida’s 19th district last year, does not appear to have a connection to New York. Born in Bethlehem, Pa., he attended college and law school at the University of Michigan and now represents Boca Raton and parts of Palm Beach. The full statement by Mr. Deutch is below: The ultimate merits of this potential merger will be debated in the days and months ahead, however, one absolute precondition of this merger must be that the iconic name of the New York Stock Exchange remain unchanged forever. The power and history of the name spans generations from the first use of the N.Y.S.E. name in 1863, to the rebuilding of our economy after the Great Depression and the dramatic reopening of trading following devastating terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The New York Stock Exchange is a foundation of the extraordinary American economic success story, and its name rightfully reflects the United States’ position as the financial center of the world. America has a tradition of protecting its national icons and we must act to protect the New York Stock Exchange. Just as we wouldn’t change the name of the Statue of Liberty, Mt. Rushmore or the Golden Gate Bridge, a new majority owner, whether foreign or American, cannot be allowed to change the name of the New York Stock Exchange. A policy discussion will begin about the ultimate merits of this merger, and as a member of the House Judiciary Committee I look forward to engaging in that discussion. However, as a member of Congress that represents tens of thousands of native New Yorkers, many of whom worked their entire careers at the N.Y.S.E., I know that any change to the name of this institution would tarnish our shared history and must not be permitted.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/whats-next-for-exchange-mergers/?ref=nyseeuronext">Exchange Mergers Raise Question of Who's Next<date>February 10, 2011, 3:12 pm</date><text>Shannon Stapleton/Reuters 8:46 p.m. | Updated As several of the world’s biggest exchange operators, including the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, work on potential landscape-altering mergers, the financial world’s attention has now turned to companies that have yet to join the party. Shares in several exchange companies, including Nasdaq OMX, the CME Group and CBOE Holdings jumped on Thursday, one day after the New York Stock Exchange’s owner, NYSE Euronext, disclosed that it was in advanced deal talks with Deutsche Börse. Also on Wednesday, the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange disclosed that they had reached a deal to combine, creating another major trans-Atlantic markets player. Investors and analysts appeared to be betting that the already-competitive exchange sector would experience another wave of consolidations as the owners of these markets sought to expand internationally and bolster positions in lucrative businesses like derivatives trading. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: German and New York Exchanges in Merger Talks DealBook: Hong Kong Open to Deal High on the list of potential deal makers are Nasdaq; CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade; and CBOE, which runs the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “The CME, the CBOE and Nasdaq are now forced to make their next move,” said Patrick J. Healy, the chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group, a New York-based adviser to companies on listing their shares. For years, the watchword within the sector has been that bigger is better, in terms of both scale and services. The big exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq have been moving away from the simple listing and trading of stocks into more lucrative areas like futures, options and derivatives trading. And once their operators have hit the break-even point after building out their platforms, every additional dollar is largely profit. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse said on Wednesday that they expected about $411 million in cost savings through their potential union. “These are essentially plumbing systems,” Niamh Alexander, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said. “You typically need only one set of pipes to carry out trades.” The merger of NYSE Euronext, whose Big Board and scores of floor brokers have long been a potent symbol of American capitalism, and Deutsche Börse, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, will certainly create a big new international giant. Industry executives say that combining the two will yield a company that is strong in American and European equities, derivatives and trading technology. Despite potential concerns about regulatory and political hurdles, the deal already has one prominent backer. “I think it’s very good for New York,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Thursday. “You’ll have the two strongest stock exchanges together, and it’s going to give us access to Europe and them access to the United States in a ways that some of our other competitors, like London, will not have.” The question for exchanges like Nasdaq and CME is where to find partners. Nasdaq’s last major deal was the 2007 purchase of OMX, a collection of seven Scandinavian exchanges, for $3.7 billion. And CME itself was born of several unions, including that of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange a year later. Among the main considerations for the exchanges is the kind of growth they should seek through a deal. Gaining access international markets — especially Asia and Latin America — is considered a high priority, as is increasing market share in higher-margin businesses like derivatives trading. Among Nasdaq’s potential merger partners or acquisition targets is CBOE, which would significantly raise its profile in services like options and indexes, according to a research note by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James. Analysts also said that BATS, an upstart electronic exchange that has seized a big portion of the domestic equities market, may be a possible target. Nasdaq may also seek to break up the London Stock Exchange’s proposed merger with its Toronto counterpart. And CME may also seek to grow internationally. The Hong Kong Exchange has signaled its openness to a deal, and other exchanges, including those in Brazil and India, may seek their own tie-ups as well. Representatives for Nasdaq and CME declined to comment. But it was not clear that even Wednesday’s deal news would prompt a near-term flurry of exchange mergers. Mr. O’Shaughnessy wrote that such mergers were difficult to complete, and that potential buyers and sellers were more likely to be patient before leaping into another round of consolidation. Potential merger partners, like a combined London-Toronto stock exchange or a Singapore-Australia exchange, are themselves in the middle of pending deals. “It simply isn’t going to be the case that all the world’s exchanges are going to pair up in the next few months to leave slowpokes standing on the sidelines without a partner,” he wrote.

The exchange, facing pressure from electronic upstarts that have taken business away from it, said on Wednesday that it was in advanced talks on a merger with the operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. A deal would create the world’s largest financial market, with a presence in 14 European countries as well as the United States. A merger would potentially let customers trade stocks in New York, options tied to those shares in Paris and derivatives linked to them in Frankfurt. A combination, after the mergers of other exchanges, would be another illustration of how globalization and technology have changed marketplaces. The New York Stock Exchange is a giant among exchanges, yet in a world of around-the-clock trading and rapid-fire algorithmic programs, its significance to investors has diminished. Once known for chief executives who were prominent cheerleaders for the stock market, the exchange now has a more muted public presence. While the ringing of the opening bell every morning and images of anxious or joyful workers on the trading floor represent the stock market to millions of people, increasingly trades are being executed by computers far from Wall Street, in places like Jersey City and Kansas City. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links NYSE Euronext press release DealBook: The London-Toronto deal DealBook: Hong Kong Open to Deal The Big Board has already undergone a radical transformation in just a few years: from a clubby nonprofit organization where brokers on the floor handled most trades to a profit-making multinational corporation engaged in largely electronic trading. Some 1,300 equities and options traders now work on the floor of the exchange, down from nearly 3,000 a decade ago. As a public company, its stock price has slumped 64 percent from a high in 2006. So while news of the merger negotiations was the talk of Wall Street on Wednesday, some had already accepted that further change was needed. “You probably need more consolidation,” said Barry Smith, 44, a financial technology executive, who sat drinking beer with two friends at Bobby Van’s Steakhouse and Grill across the street from the exchange. Under the terms being negotiated, the New York Stock Exchange — which began in 1792 when brokers gathered beneath a buttonwood tree in Lower Manhattan to trade five securities of the new nation — would still have a headquarters in Manhattan. But the Deutsche Börse would own as much as 60 percent of the new company, which would be incorporated in the Netherlands. If a deal is reached, it could still face several hurdles, including regulatory and political resistance. New York City leaders have been particularly vocal about maintaining the city’s status as the leading financial capital. Competition among exchanges has grown more intense in recent years as investors seeking speed, lower costs and greater liquidity have flocked to electronic platforms that pay little heed to financial centers or tradition. Exchanges are under pressure to get bigger to cut costs and invest in technology that will allow them to host as many transactions as quickly as possible. “There is a race toward exchanges becoming ever bigger,” said Elie Darwish, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris. “This would give NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse an unchallengeable position.” Much of the $411 million in expected cost savings from a combination of the New York Exchange and the Deutsch Börse is expected to come from combining the two companies’ technology systems and back-office operations. Fewer than 1,000 job cuts are expected, with less than 100 in New York, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss it. Still, a merger could raise l questions about the importance of the exchange to the vitality of the financial industry in New York. The role of the exchange’s professionals on the floor may become more limited as a result. Michael Pagano, a professor at the Villanova School of Business, said those floor specialists could help during times of market stress like the “flash crash” of May. “They could become something like the Maytag repairman,” he said. “He doesn’t necessarily do anything all day, but he’s there when you need him.” The joint statement by the two companies closely followed the announcement of an all-stock merger of the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. While NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse confirmed that they were in “advanced discussions” about a deal, they cautioned that the talks might still fall apart. Deutsche Börse has a history of trying to merge with other exchanges, including the Big Board and the London Stock Exchange, without success. Still, a merger could be announced as soon as the middle of next week, according to the person briefed on the matter. NYSE Euronext shareholders are expected to receive a roughly 10 percent premium to their shares, this person added. The last six years have yielded several big exchange unions, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s purchases of the Chicago Board of Trade and Nymex Holdings and the Singapore exchange’s proposed acquisition of the Australian Stock Exchange. NYSE Euronext itself is the product of the New York Stock Exchange’s takeovers of Archipelago Holdings, which gave it an electronic trading platform, Euronext and the American Stock Exchange. Wednesday’s announcements will probably put additional pressure on smaller players, like the Nasdaq stock market, to seek additional partners to keep up. Deutsche Börse’s chief executive, Reto Francioni, would serve as chairman from Frankfurt. Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, would serve the same role for the combined company, whose name has not been determined. The names of the local markets, including the New York Stock Exchange, would remain, in part to try to mitigate political backlash. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse held merger talks twice before, in 2008 and 2009, before resuming discussions again late last year, according to the person briefed on the matter.

The drop in revenue was tied to a decline in pricing that exchanges have dealt with in recent years. Newer exchange operators have entered the market, forcing companies like NYSE Euronext to cut the price it charges to execute stock and derivative trades. NYSE Euronext — which operates the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext in Paris among others — also grappled with declining market share because of the new competitors. However, the portion of trades NYSE Euronext completed rose during the third quarter compared with a year ago. Nasdaq OMX Group also announced a modest improvement in market share when it announced results last week. NYSE Euronext, like other exchanges, was also hurt by a slowdown in overall trading volume in the United States stock market during the summer. Volumes were especially light, even factoring in the seasonal slowdown. Cash market trading in the United States fell 22 percent during the third quarter. But the company’s profit still rose as a result of a smaller provision for tax payments during the quarter. NYSE Euronext earned $128 million, or 49 cents a share, during the third quarter, compared with net income of $125 million, or 48 cents a share, during the same quarter last year. Revenue after transaction-based expenses fell to $599 million, from $621 million during the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast NYSE Euronext would earn 43 cents a share on revenue of $592 million.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/flash-trading-driving-the-leibowitzes-apart/?ref=nyseeuronext">Flash Trading: Driving the Leibowitzes Apart<date>October 11, 2010, 7:11 pm</date><text>High-frequency trading has been a flash point of finance for months now, attracting critics and defenders in almost equal measure. But one family appears riven right down the middle over the topic. Specifically, the Leibowitz brothers, one of whom happens to be a top executive at the New York Stock Exchange, and the other, Jon Stewart. On Sunday night, Larry Leibowitz, the chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext, had his say on high-frequency trading on “60 Minutes,” a little over a year after his brother’s colleagues lampooned the practice on “The Daily Show.” The Daily Show With Jon Stewart Mon – Thurs 11p / 10c Cash Cow – High-Frequency Trading www.thedailyshow.com Daily Show Full Episodes Political Humor Rally to Restore Sanity High-frequency trading (or flash trading) is, of course, the use of high-speed computers and complex algorithms to trade stocks faster than humans can. With the “flash crash” the subject of intense scrutiny since the spring, H.F.T. has been to some a bogeyman, and to others a necessary component of today’s liquid markets. Mr. Leibowitz, naturally, is a fan of the trading. From “60 Minutes”: Larry Leibowitz of the New York Stock Exchange says there is absolutely no evidence that small investors are being hurt by high frequency trading. Most of them, he says, don’t care about pennies when they are buying and selling stocks. And they’re in it for the longer haul. “Look, there’s always been charges for as long as trading has existed that people are front running orders, manipulating stocks. This is nothing new. I think now you add to it the element of the mysterious element of ‘the computer’ and it makes people even more mistrustful,” he told Kroft. Leave it to “The Daily Show” to have a slightly different take. And by different, we mean having its correspondent, Samantha Bee, dress up as the “Cash Cow.” And she asked whether traders were being replaced by computers, using a term originally applied to a particular type of women’s hygiene product.

Michael Pagano, a professor at the Villanova School of Business, said those floor specialists could help during times of market stress like the “flash crash” of May. “They could become something like the Maytag repairman,” he said. “He doesn’t necessarily do anything all day, but he’s there when you need him.” The joint statement by the two companies closely followed the announcement of an all-stock merger of the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. While NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse confirmed that they were in “advanced discussions” about a deal, they cautioned that the talks might still fall apart. Deutsche Börse has a history of trying to merge with other exchanges, including the Big Board and the London Stock Exchange, without success. Still, a merger could be announced as soon as the middle of next week, according to the person briefed on the matter. NYSE Euronext shareholders are expected to receive a roughly 10 percent premium to their shares, this person added. The last six years have yielded several big exchange unions, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s purchases of the Chicago Board of Trade and Nymex Holdings and the Singapore exchange’s proposed acquisition of the Australian Stock Exchange. NYSE Euronext itself is the product of the New York Stock Exchange’s takeovers of Archipelago Holdings, which gave it an electronic trading platform, Euronext and the American Stock Exchange. Wednesday’s announcements will probably put additional pressure on smaller players, like the Nasdaq stock market, to seek additional partners to keep up. Deutsche Börse’s chief executive, Reto Francioni, would serve as chairman from Frankfurt. Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, would serve the same role for the combined company, whose name has not been determined. The names of the local markets, including the New York Stock Exchange, would remain, in part to try to mitigate political backlash. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse held merger talks twice before, in 2008 and 2009, before resuming discussions again late last year, according to the person briefed on the matter.

The drop in revenue was tied to a decline in pricing that exchanges have dealt with in recent years. Newer exchange operators have entered the market, forcing companies like NYSE Euronext to cut the price it charges to execute stock and derivative trades. NYSE Euronext — which operates the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext in Paris among others — also grappled with declining market share because of the new competitors. However, the portion of trades NYSE Euronext completed rose during the third quarter compared with a year ago. Nasdaq OMX Group also announced a modest improvement in market share when it announced results last week. NYSE Euronext, like other exchanges, was also hurt by a slowdown in overall trading volume in the United States stock market during the summer. Volumes were especially light, even factoring in the seasonal slowdown. Cash market trading in the United States fell 22 percent during the third quarter. But the company’s profit still rose as a result of a smaller provision for tax payments during the quarter. NYSE Euronext earned $128 million, or 49 cents a share, during the third quarter, compared with net income of $125 million, or 48 cents a share, during the same quarter last year. Revenue after transaction-based expenses fell to $599 million, from $621 million during the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast NYSE Euronext would earn 43 cents a share on revenue of $592 million.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/flash-trading-driving-the-leibowitzes-apart/?ref=nyseeuronext">Flash Trading: Driving the Leibowitzes Apart<date>October 11, 2010, 7:11 pm</date><text>High-frequency trading has been a flash point of finance for months now, attracting critics and defenders in almost equal measure. But one family appears riven right down the middle over the topic. Specifically, the Leibowitz brothers, one of whom happens to be a top executive at the New York Stock Exchange, and the other, Jon Stewart. On Sunday night, Larry Leibowitz, the chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext, had his say on high-frequency trading on “60 Minutes,” a little over a year after his brother’s colleagues lampooned the practice on “The Daily Show.” The Daily Show With Jon Stewart Mon – Thurs 11p / 10c Cash Cow – High-Frequency Trading www.thedailyshow.com Daily Show Full Episodes Political Humor Rally to Restore Sanity High-frequency trading (or flash trading) is, of course, the use of high-speed computers and complex algorithms to trade stocks faster than humans can. With the “flash crash” the subject of intense scrutiny since the spring, H.F.T. has been to some a bogeyman, and to others a necessary component of today’s liquid markets. Mr. Leibowitz, naturally, is a fan of the trading. From “60 Minutes”: Larry Leibowitz of the New York Stock Exchange says there is absolutely no evidence that small investors are being hurt by high frequency trading. Most of them, he says, don’t care about pennies when they are buying and selling stocks. And they’re in it for the longer haul. “Look, there’s always been charges for as long as trading has existed that people are front running orders, manipulating stocks. This is nothing new. I think now you add to it the element of the mysterious element of ‘the computer’ and it makes people even more mistrustful,” he told Kroft. Leave it to “The Daily Show” to have a slightly different take. And by different, we mean having its correspondent, Samantha Bee, dress up as the “Cash Cow.” And she asked whether traders were being replaced by computers, using a term originally applied to a particular type of women’s hygiene product.

The company earned $184 million in the second quarter, or 64 cents per share — up from $132 million, or 51 cents, a year ago. Revenue climbed 7 percent to $654 million. Analysts on average expected NYSE Euronext to earn 59 cents per share on $659.6 million in revenue. “Our strong second quarter results were driven by robust trading volumes, strong revenue generation from new initiatives across our segments and continued cost discipline,” said Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext. The results include a pretax gain from disposals of $54 million. Gains in revenue were lifted by a $31 million, or 10 percent, increase in transaction and clearing revenues, mostly related to derivatives trading. A further $26 million, or 53 percent, increase in technology services revenue also boosted quarterly activity.

But, maddeningly, the cause or causes of the market’s wild swing remained elusive, leaving what amounts to a $1 trillion question mark hanging over the world’s largest, and most celebrated, stock market. The initial focus of the investigations appeared to center on the way a growing number of high-speed trading networks interact with one another and with venerable exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Most investors are unaware that these competing systems have fractured the traditional marketplace and have displaced exchanges like the Big Board as the dominant force in stock trading. The silence from Washington cast a pall over Wall Street, where shaken traders returned to their desks Friday morning hoping for quick answers. The markets remained on edge, as the uncertainty over what caused Thursday’s wild swings added to the worries over the running debt crisis in Greece. In a joint statement issued after the close of trading, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they were continuing their review. And the two agencies indicated they were looking particularly closely at how different trading rules on different exchanges, which temporarily halted trading on some markets while activity in the same stocks continued on other markets, might have contributed to the problem. “We are scrutinizing the extent to which disparate trading conventions and rules across various markets may have contributed to the spike in volatility,” the statement said. A government official who was involved in the investigation said regulators had moved away from a theory that it was a trading mistake — a so-called fat finger episode — and were examining the links between the futures and cash markets for stocks. In particular, this official said, it appeared that as stock trading was slowed on the New York Exchange when big price moves started, orders moved automatically to other, electronic exchanges that did not have pricing restrictions. The pressure in the less-liquid markets was amplified by the computer-driven trades, which led still other traders to pull back. Only when traders began to manually respond to the sharp drop did the market seem to turn around, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was not complete. On Friday evening, another government official directly involved in the investigation said that regulators had not yet been able to completely rule out any of the widely discussed possible causes of the market’s gyrations. This official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that regulators had collected statistical and trading data from stock and futures exchanges, and had begun cross-analyzing that with trading reports from brokerage firms and large market participants. Regulators have also gathered anecdotal accounts of what happened from hedge funds and other trading firms. The two major regulatory agencies — the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — have generated multiple memos detailing what they have found and offering possible causes for the market events. Among the issues discussed in the memos, the official said, were the disparate rules that different stock exchanges have for dealing with large price movements on the same securities and how prices on futures markets and stock exchanges appeared to lead or follow each other’s movements down and back up. The lack of a firm answer, more than 24 hours after the market’s plunge Thursday, left some on Wall Street frustrated. “The problem is you don’t come in and find out what the clear answer is,” said Art Hogan, the New York-based chief market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company. “We don’t have the clear explanation for how it happened.” Others, however, said it would take time to pinpoint what happened given the increasingly complex nature of modern stock trading. Over the last five years, the stock market has split into a plethora of new competing hubs and trading outlets, a legacy of deregulation earlier this decade and fast-paced technological change. On Friday, the rivalry between the two main exchanges erupted into view as each publicly pointed the finger at the other for being a main cause of the collapse on Thursday, which sent shockwaves around the globe. “This is the sort of situation that has been a worry for a long time, but the markets have changed in a way that has made things more difficult,” said Robert L. D. Colby, former deputy director of trading and markets at the S.E.C. “They’ve become more fragmented, so it’s harder for any one exchange to see the full picture and take action.” On Friday, President Obama sought to provide reassurance that regulators were working to find the root of the problem. “The regulatory authorities are evaluating this closely with a concern for protecting investors and preventing this from happening again,” the president said. The absence of a unified system to halt trading in individual stocks led to bitter accusations between exchanges on Friday. Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, appeared on CNBC to criticize the New York Stock Exchange for halting trading for up to 90 seconds in half a dozen stocks on Thursday. “Stopping for 90 seconds in time of crisis is exactly equivalent to not picking up the phone,” Mr. Greifeld said. A few minutes later, Duncan L. Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, responded in an interview on CNBC, blaming Nasdaq’s computers for continuing trading while the market was in free fall. “These computers go out and just find the next bid they can find,” he said. Mr. Niederauer acknowledged the need to introduce circuit-breakers along the lines of those already in place on the Big Board, and his views were echoed by some chief executives of the new exchanges.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/temasek-gets-5-percent-of-indian-stock-exchange/?ref=nyseeuronext">Temasek Buys 5 Percent of Indian Stock Exchange<date>May 4, 2010, 4:24 am</date><text>Temasek Holdings has purchased a 5 percent stake in the National Stock Exchange of India from N.Y.S.E.

The chief executive of NYSE Euronext said on Tuesday the president’s plan fell short of attacking what caused the financial crisis, while his counterpart at Nasdaq OMX Group, the day before, said the plan would probably have to be changed. President Obama last month surprised Wall Street with the ambitious proposal to limit risky trading by banks. Called the Volcker rule after Paul A. Volcker, the White House economics adviser, it would bar banks from proprietary trading, or placing bets on markets with their own money. The proposal jolted markets. The shares of the New York Stock Exchange parent fell 3.8 percent, while those of the Nasdaq Stock Market parent tumbled 4.8 percent, on concerns the Volcker rule would reduce liquidity and trading volumes. In a conference call with analysts and media, Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said it would prove difficult to separate “the small fraction of equity volume that these banks do for their own account.” “I don’t really think that had anything to do with the crisis that we just lived through,” the former Goldman Sachs trading head said, adding he would encourage policy makers “to focus on solutions that get at the root cause of the crisis and I just don’t think this is one of them.” Robert Greifeld, the chief of Nasdaq OMX, said on Monday it was impossible to know how much bank trading volume was proprietary versus nonproprietary because it was not identified on arrival at the exchange. “In a sense that shows you the difficulty the legislators would have prescribing anti-prop trading,” he said in a conference call Monday. “It’s a hard job for them to do because once you get into what’s prop, what’s customer facilitation, what’s a riskless principal, it gets impossible. “So I think they would have to find a different path to go.” The Volcker rule gained some support among European lawmakers, who are also considering new rules to avoid a repetition of the mortgage market-inspired crisis of 2008 that spawned a global recession. Banks have criticized the plan. It also faced resistance last week from U.S. senators, who looked increasingly likely to adopt, at best, only a watered-down version. Mr. Niederauer and Mr. Greifeld played down the impact the Volcker rule would have on volumes, which drive the exchange operators’ revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated the plan would shave NYSE Euronext’s 2010 earnings by 2 percent and shave Nasdaq OMX’s earnings 3 percent — assuming all U.S. and non-U.S. bank proprietary trading disappeared and flowed directly to the exchange operators’ bottom lines. “The impact will ultimately be far less onerous than it appeared at first blush,” the analysts said in a Jan. 27 note, adding that the futures-based exchanges CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange would be hit harder than the more diversified cash equities exchanges.

The operator of the New York Stock Exchange and markets in Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels reported net profit of $172 million in the three months to Dec. 31, compared to a $1.34 billion net loss a year earlier, when collapsing equity markets forced it to slash the value of the 2007 merger of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext. Revenue slipped 7 percent in the fourth quarter to $1.13 billion. The company blamed ”a decline in global cash equities volumes” as well as price cuts at some of its European and U.S. operations. For the full year, NYSE Euronext reported net profit $219 million, as revenue slipped 0.3 percent to $4.69 billion. To counter falling revenue, NYSE Euronext said it managed to cut its fixed operating expenses by 11 percent over the year. In October, it completed its acquisition of the American Stock Exchange, a deal that it says will provide annualized savings of more than $100 million.

New York Stock Exchange parent NYSE Euronext said on Tuesday its all-electronic Arca venue executes buy and sell orders in as little as 650 microseconds, round-trip, now that it is connected to the company’s new universal trading system. A millisecond is a thousandth of a second; a microsecond is a millionth of second. NYSE Euronext’s slower Big Board processes trades in less than five milliseconds, a spokesman told Reuters, about on par with Tokyo’s new “Arrowhead” system. NYSE Euronext is among the world’s fastest exchange operators. However, it is probably not the leader in a race that is more competitive than ever and it is difficult to measure and compare venues because there is no globally accepted standard. Speed is a key concern for all investors, particularly the so-called high-frequency traders that use sophisticated algorithms to make thousands of trades per second and account for about 60 percent of all United States stock trading. BATS Global Markets, a privately-owned exchange operator often lauded for its speedy trading infrastructure, said on Tuesday its United States platform recently reduced its average order latency from 400 microseconds to 250 microseconds. BATS measures “the time it takes to accept, process, and acknowledge or fill a member order,” its Web site said. Nasdaq OMX, meanwhile, sent an e-mail message to reporters late Monday noting its centerpiece Nasdaq Stock Market — also seen as a top venue in terms of speed — accepts, processes and acknowledges or fills orders in less than one millisecond and “is capable of sub-250 microsecond average speeds …” Analysts say speed, known as “latency” in trading industry parlance, is now more vital than ever as banks, funds and independent trading firms scramble to improve technology in order to get better prices, or “fills”, when they trade. Tokyo’s upgrade could accelerate competition among North American, European and Asian exchanges, and broaden horizons for investors, said Sang Lee, managing partner specializing in market structure at Boston-based consultancy Aite Group. “It could fundamentally change the way things are done in Asia,” Mr. Lee said of the possibility that alternative venues could gain traction there. “With latency coming down, people might be more open to trading in other locations.” Also on Tuesday, NYSE Euronext said it made changes to its global data feed to tap into Tokyo’s Arrowhead platform.

To counter falling revenue, NYSE Euronext said it managed to cut its fixed operating expenses by 11 percent over the year. In October, it completed its acquisition of the American Stock Exchange, a deal that it says will provide annualized savings of more than $100 million.

New York Stock Exchange parent NYSE Euronext said on Tuesday its all-electronic Arca venue executes buy and sell orders in as little as 650 microseconds, round-trip, now that it is connected to the company’s new universal trading system. A millisecond is a thousandth of a second; a microsecond is a millionth of second. NYSE Euronext’s slower Big Board processes trades in less than five milliseconds, a spokesman told Reuters, about on par with Tokyo’s new “Arrowhead” system. NYSE Euronext is among the world’s fastest exchange operators. However, it is probably not the leader in a race that is more competitive than ever and it is difficult to measure and compare venues because there is no globally accepted standard. Speed is a key concern for all investors, particularly the so-called high-frequency traders that use sophisticated algorithms to make thousands of trades per second and account for about 60 percent of all United States stock trading. BATS Global Markets, a privately-owned exchange operator often lauded for its speedy trading infrastructure, said on Tuesday its United States platform recently reduced its average order latency from 400 microseconds to 250 microseconds. BATS measures “the time it takes to accept, process, and acknowledge or fill a member order,” its Web site said. Nasdaq OMX, meanwhile, sent an e-mail message to reporters late Monday noting its centerpiece Nasdaq Stock Market — also seen as a top venue in terms of speed — accepts, processes and acknowledges or fills orders in less than one millisecond and “is capable of sub-250 microsecond average speeds …” Analysts say speed, known as “latency” in trading industry parlance, is now more vital than ever as banks, funds and independent trading firms scramble to improve technology in order to get better prices, or “fills”, when they trade. Tokyo’s upgrade could accelerate competition among North American, European and Asian exchanges, and broaden horizons for investors, said Sang Lee, managing partner specializing in market structure at Boston-based consultancy Aite Group. “It could fundamentally change the way things are done in Asia,” Mr. Lee said of the possibility that alternative venues could gain traction there. “With latency coming down, people might be more open to trading in other locations.” Also on Tuesday, NYSE Euronext said it made changes to its global data feed to tap into Tokyo’s Arrowhead platform.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic The Shrinking Big Board Related Stocks and Bonds: Dow, First Time in a Year, Breaks Through 10,000 (October 15, 2009) Add to Portfolio NYSE Euronext Go to your Portfolio » Behind its Greco-Roman facade, traders raised a Dante-esque din in their pursuit of the almighty dollar. Good times or bad, the daily melee on the cavernous trading floor made the Big Board the greatest marketplace for stocks in the world. But now, even as the Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 for the first time since the financial crisis sent it tumbling, the exchange and its hometown face an unsettling truth: the Big Board, the symbolic heart of New York’s financial industry, is getting smaller. Young, fast-moving rivals are splintering its public marketplace and creating private markets that, their critics say, give big banks and investment funds an edge over ordinary investors. Some of the new trading venues  “dark pools,” the industry calls them  are all but invisible, even to regulators. These stealth markets enable sophisticated traders to buy and sell large blocks of stock in secrecy at lightning speed, a practice that has drawn scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These upstarts are utterly unlike the old-school Big Board, which is struggling to make its way as a for-profit corporation after centuries of ownership by its seat-holding members. Last year, its parent company, NYSE Euronext, lost $740 million. Wall Street’s judgment has been swift and brutal. Since January 2007, the share price of NYSE Euronext has lost nearly three-quarters of its value, even though stock trading over all has soared. While the exchange has been under assault since the beginning of the decade, its decline has accelerated in recent years as aggressive competitors have emerged. Today, 36 percent of daily trades in stocks that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange are actually executed on the exchange, down from about 75 percent nearly four years ago. The rest of are conducted elsewhere, on new electronic exchanges or through dark pools. The old Big Board was far from perfect. Its floor brokers  who occupy a privileged, and potentially lucrative, niche between buyers and sellers  have sometimes enriched themselves at their customers’ expense. But changes inside the exchange’s grand Main Hall are startling. For decades, the New York Exchange was the kind of place where sons followed their fathers onto the trading floor. But half of the jobs there have disappeared over the last five years. Many of the 1,200 or so remaining workers retreat quietly to their computers shortly after the opening bell clangs at 9:30 a.m. The Big Board has been forced to close one of its five trading halls, and it has repopulated two others with business from the American Stock Exchange, which NYSE Euronext bought last year. The Main Hall  the soaring, gilded room opened in 1903  can seem little more than a colorful backdrop for CNBC. “It has not been pretty,” said Benn Steil of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “All the big established exchanges around the world have experienced the same phenomenon, but the New York Stock Exchange has taken the biggest beating.” It is a remarkable comedown for the New York Exchange, and for New York. Once the undisputed capital of capital, the city is struggling to retain its dominance in finance as the industry globalizes. “Wall Street” seems to be no longer a place, but a vast, worldwide network of money and information. The Big Board says that it is fighting back  and that its hybrid of computers and human traders can beat the new rivals. It slashed commissions and developed its own purely electronic exchange, Arca, in Chicago. Arca has captured about 11 percent of the market for Big Board-listed stocks. It is also winning business in areas like derivatives. “What’s going on here is a reinvention,” said Lawrence Leibowitz, head of United States markets and global technology at NYSE Euronext. “How can you bring this institution forward into the 21st century?” Proponents of the new exchanges and private trading systems contend that ordinary people benefit from the technologies whether they know it or not. “Competition has benefited the average investor,” said William O’Brien, chief executive of Direct Edge, one of the new exchanges. “Their broker has so many choices available, on or off exchanges, anywhere in the world, and they can get their order executed in less than a second.” Critics maintain that only the most sophisticated players are benefiting, able to execute their trades seconds before smaller investors and in private. “There are tools now that certain investors have that give them an advantage over other investors,” said Joseph Saluzzi, who trades equities for institutional investors and hedge funds at his boutique brokerage, Themis Trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission is beginning to take notice of such complaints, opening investigations into the new type of trading venues and promising action. It is worried, for example, that dark pools, with their scale unknown, could destabilize the market. Unlike the Big Board, the new electronic exchanges are virtually unknown outside financial circles. Direct Edge, the largest, is in Jersey City. Another, the BATS Exchange, is based in Lenexa, Kan. Both are only about five years old. But each now accounts for about a 10th of daily United States stock trading. In its fight to survive, the Big Board is building a new data center in New Jersey and another outside London. The Main Hall is being overhauled, in an attempt to lure business back to the floor. There is even a new coffee shop, Outtakes. Even so, the world still watches  literally  what happens on the New York Stock Exchange. Twenty television networks broadcast live from the exchange, in nine languages. But whichever way the market goes from here, many see a difficult road for the Big Board. The competition is unlikely to let up. “There has been a sea change,” said Sang Lee of the Aite Group, a financial services consulting company. “I don’t envy what any of the exchanges have to do.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 15, 2009, on page A1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/business/12schapiro.html?ref=nyseeuronext">S.E.C. Choice Is Sued Over a Merger of Regulators<date>Correction: April 4, 2009Published: January 11, 2009</date><text>WASHINGTON  Mary L. Schapiro, who appears this week at a confirmation hearing on her selection to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been accused in two lawsuits of making misleading statements to quickly complete a merger of regulatory organizations after which she received a 57 percent raise in her pay. Skip to next paragraph Tannen Maury/European Pressphoto Agency Mary L. Schapiro had a pay jump when becoming chief of Finra. Related Times Topics: Mary L. Schapiro The merger involved the regulatory units of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASD two years ago. Ms. Schapiro was then head of the NASD, and she spent months traveling the country to persuade its 5,100 members to support it. The merger created a new self-regulatory organization, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, where Ms. Schapiro is the chief executive. The Securities and Exchange Commission relies on Finra to police Wall Street. Among the misstatements that she is accused of making is that the Internal Revenue Service had prohibited the NASD from paying each member more than $35,000 as part of the merger deal. Although an NASD proxy statement issued while the deal was pending said that the I.R.S. would not permit the organization to give more compensation to members, the I.R.S. did not actually issue a ruling on the matter until March 2007, long after the deal closed and three months after the members voted to approve it. Lawyers representing Ms. Schapiro, Finra and other senior executives have fought vigorously to keep the I.R.S. ruling  and court references to details of that ruling  under seal. Last January, a federal judge in New York denied a request by The New York Times to unseal the ruling and other documents in the case. Ms. Schapiro’s lawyer has denied the lawsuits’ allegations and, in a recent interview said that the second suit, filed shortly after her selection, is an opportunistic effort to pressure the defendants to settle. The first, dismissed by a federal district judge in New York, is on appeal. At the S.E.C., Ms. Schapiro would be leading a government regulator that has been battered by setbacks, including its failure to uncover the apparent long-running fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. A recent report by the S.E.C.’s inspector general said the agency had failed to adequately police the markets and regulate Wall Street’s largest investment banks. Congressional critics have said the S.E.C.’s shortcomings contributed to the financial crisis. The strongest proponents of the merger that created Finra were the more than 200 firms that were members of both the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange. The merger significantly lowered their regulatory expenses, but many of the smaller members were concerned about what benefits they might receive from it. In an effort to get enough votes from the smaller firms, NASD offered each member $35,000, for a total of about $178 million, and a smaller commitment to reduce future assessments. Executives said that amount was derived from a calculation of efficiencies from merging the organizations. NASD listed its total outstanding equity in an annual report of more than $1.6 billion. NASD officials, including Ms. Schapiro, said then that the organization could not make a greater payment because the I.R.S. had opposed it because the NASD is nonprofit. The lawsuits challenge that assertion, saying that evidence that remains sealed undermines the NASD’s description of the I.R.S. ruling. Also sealed is an independent fairness opinion on the merger by the investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Financial Advisors. “Our cases raise questions about the transparency, truthfulness and candor of the NASD and its leadership in a major financial transaction with its own members,” said Jonathan W. Cuneo, the lead lawyer in both cases for the member firms. “It’s certainly ironic that the case involves the NASD, which is charged with policing those values in others.” Defense lawyers said in court papers and an interview that no material misrepresentations were made. They assert that the top executives of the organization, as regulators, are entitled to absolute immunity from lawsuits. They say that the members of the NASD were not entitled to greater compensation because they do not have the same rights as shareholders of a corporation. “These lawsuits are meritless, and the second suit is just a dressed-up version of the first one that was rejected by a federal judge,” said F. Joseph Warin, a lawyer representing Finra and Ms. Schapiro. “The lawyers are the same, and the arguments are virtually identical. The second suit was filed days after Ms. Schapiro was nominated to become chairman of the S.E.C. It looks to me like a desperate effort to leverage Mary’s nomination to squeeze money out of Finra before her confirmation vote  a last-second Hail Mary pass.” Mr. Cuneo said that the second lawsuit was in the works long before the announcement of Ms. Schapiro’s appointment and that its filing had nothing to do with her selection. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: April 4, 2009 An article on Jan. 12 about two lawsuits filed against Mary L.

Niederauer needed someone to ring his bell. On Monday, one of the darkest days in Wall Street's history, the actress who was supposed to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange decided not to push the button given the turmoil in the markets. Mr. Niederauer, who heads the exchange, had one of his officials do the job, officially ending a day on which the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 778 points. The actress Missi Pyle, who appeared as the buxom alien Laliari in the cult hit ''Galaxy Quest'' and is currently on Broadway in the French farce ''Boeing Boeing,'' said on Tuesday that she had ''decided to let the day be about the market and not about having a celebrity ring the bell.'' She added that she had watched the close from the floor of the exchange. The Big Board says it has plenty of ready ringers. The job, after all, is supposed to be an honor, or at the very least a photo opportunity. But at a time when the markets are unsettled, some public relations types wonder: Who wants to ring in -- or out -- the next black day on Wall Street? ''Right now, it can be a little bit like being asked to blow the foghorn on the Titanic,'' said Jim Haggerty, chief executive of the PR Consulting Group, which advises companies on communications strategies. On Tuesday morning, as anxious traders poured through the exchange's Corinthian marble facade, no corporate executives or celebrities mounted the podium high over the floor to sound the start of trading. Instead, an anonymous floor manager kicked off a session in which stocks rebounded sharply. According to the exchange, no one in particular was scheduled to ring the bell, partly because it was Rosh Hashana. ''There is huge demand to ring the N.Y.S.E. opening and closing bells, and those people and organizations who participate are respectful of both the global recognition in doing so and prevailing market conditions,'' said Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for the exchange. Ringing the Opening Bell (the capital letters are part of an N.Y.S.E. trademark) emerged as a powerful corporate branding exercise in mid-1990s. Big publicly traded companies started swallowing up entertainment properties and began trotting out film stars, singers and other celebrities to promote movies and products. The N.Y.S.E. also often invites heads of state and sports figures, like the Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, to push the button that activates the brass bells in each of the exchange's four trading rooms. The boom in initial public offerings in the late 1990s also brought a parade of young executives to the N.Y.S.E. podium and to the opening and closing ceremonies at the Times Square headquarters of the Nasdaq, the all-electronic exchange. With the explosion in financial news coverage on CNBC and other cable networks, the N.Y.S.E. opening bell is now seen by more than 100 million viewers a day, many of them affluent consumers. The question now is whether executives want to take the risk of having those wealthy millions associate them or their companies with another big sell-off. At the Nasdaq on Monday, that question confronted executives from the Solar Electric Power Association who were scheduled to ring the closing bell on a day when the markets were crushed by the failure of the House to approve a rescue package for the financial industry. Julia Hamm, executive director of the association, said the group went ahead with its plan after discussing the issue with Nasdaq officials. Executives flew from around the country over the weekend, she said, and they decided they might be able to offer a small ray of light on a dark day. ''The market was in a really bad place, but solar and green technology are areas that continue to do well,'' Ms. Hamm said. ''Sometimes when things are going badly, you need to have some things to look at that are positive.'' In addition to fear in the markets, a significant decline in initial public offerings this year -- another sign of trouble -- has somewhat damped the flow of first-time ringers at the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq. As a result, sports stars and public officials, as well as executives from companies that went public long ago, have been ringing the bells lately. Panasonic, for instance, was set to do so on Wednesday to celebrate the official changing of its name from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. The event is to include a display of the world's largest high-definition plasma television, a 150-inch monster, in a tent outside the N.Y.S.E.'s entrance on Broad Street. Thus far, most of the scariest drops in Wall Street history, including the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, occurred before the bell become a public relations phenomenon. One big exception came Sept. 17, 2001, when the N.Y.S.E. reopened after the 9/11 terrorist attack on Lower Manhattan. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani joined Richard A. Grasso, the N.Y.S.E. chairman, and a group of police officers and firefighters in ringing the bell that day, when the Dow plunged 7.1 percent. The 7 percent drop in the Dow on Monday came after executives from Duff &amp; Phelps, a financial advisory group, celebrated their first anniversary as a public company by ringing the opening bell. While chagrined at the day's events, executives at Duff &amp; Phelps take some heart that because of electrical glitches, the bell never actually rang on Monday. ''We didn't actually open the worst day in recent history,'' said Marty Dauer, a spokesman for the company. ''And that is fortuitous for us.''

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio NYSE Euronext Go to your Portfolio » The share price of NYSE Euronext, which owns the venerable New York Stock Exchange, has tumbled even more than the broader American stock market this year. The Big Board, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Friday, has lost 45 percent of its value. Investors fear the troubles plaguing the financial industry bode ill for the NYSE and other exchanges, whose profits depend on trading volume. Shares of the Nasdaq OMX Group, the parent of the Nasdaq Stock Market, and those of the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Boerse have fallen hard too this year. Even the CME Group, the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has stumbled in the stock market, despite the run-up in the prices of many of the commodities traded on the Merc. CME’s shares have fallen nearly 46 percent. Exchange executives complain that the shares of their companies  many of which transformed themselves in recent years from nonprofit enterprises owned by their seat-holding members to for-profit, shareholder-owned corporations  are suffering collateral damage from the credit squeeze. “We’ve been unjustly tarred with the same brush that the Street has been using with the financial stocks,” said David Warren, the chief financial officer of Nasdaq, the big electronic exchange where the shares of many leading technology companies are traded. “But we’re not a financial company as much as we’re a technology company.” Exchanges are the pipelines that connect buyers and sellers in the marketplace. They typically benefit from turbulence in the markets because people trade more frequently during volatile times. Exchanges make money every time someone buys or sells. So it might seem that investors would be cheering these days, because trading in many types of instruments is up. But judging by the exchange’s share prices, investors seem to be worrying that it is only a matter of time before the pain at banks filters through to the exchanges. Banks have been dumping assets and reducing lending to hedge funds, a process known on Wall Street as deleveraging, and investors fear that will hurt the exchanges. “Have the fundamentals of the business models been changed or damaged? No,” Niamh Alexander, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said of the exchanges. “But there’s been a fear of deleveraging impacting the trading volume.” But so far, the impact has been small. For the most part, trading is up. Trading of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, for example, is up 41 percent from a year ago. Trading of companies listed on Nasdaq is up 7 percent, and trading in American futures is up 22 percent. Granted, weakness has been spotted in two types of instruments traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange: long-term interest rate derivatives and options on Eurodollars. The outlook for such instruments simply looks too uncertain to many investors, said Donald Fandetti, an analyst who covers the exchange companies for Citi Investment Research. But overall trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up, in particular in foreign exchange markets, equities and commodities. Executives at the Merc have been watching to see if banks were reducing trading but, so far, proprietary trading desks and hedge funds have not scaled back, said Craig Donohue, the exchange’s chief executive. “People will try to think through the connection points between the financial markets, and I do think deleveraging has been a significant concern for investors and shareholders,” Mr. Donohue said. Mr. Donohue said that banks were mostly getting rid of hard-to-value assets, and those assets are not traded on the exchanges. For exchanges, there could even be a silver lining to the woes on Wall Street. In some parts of the markets, their biggest competitors are investment banks. Banks handle trading that is off of the exchanges, or so-called over-the-counter trading. With many banks suffering, exchanges may be able to grab some of that business. The exchanges have offered good news to investors in recent months, with little benefit to their stock prices. Nasdaq closed its acquisition of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which gave the company a better foothold in options. NYSE Euronext announced connections with so-called dark pools, which provide trading out of sight from the open market. And the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is close to closing its acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange. But each piece of news is greeted with a shrug as investors continue to lump exchanges with bank stocks. When bank stocks rallied in mid-July, the exchanges followed. But they fell soon after when the bank stocks retreated. “The exchange stocks you would think of as benefiting from volatility,” said Mr. Fandetti of Citi Investment Research. “They’ve now become a product of the credit crunch.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/business/31insider.html?ref=nyseeuronext">Convictions of Supervisors at Stock Exchange Overturned<date>Published: July 31, 2008</date><text>A federal appeals court dealt what was likely to be the final blow to the ill-fated prosecution of 15 New York Stock Exchange specialists Wednesday by overturning the securities fraud convictions of two of the floor supervisors. Skip to next paragraph The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out the convictions of the supervisors, Michael Hayward and Michael Stern, who were convicted in July 2006 and sentenced to six months in prison. Mr. Hayward, 57, and Mr. Stern, 55, who had worked for Van der Moolen Specialists USA, had been accused of stealing $1 million apiece by skimming small amounts of money from stocks they oversaw. Prosecutors concluded that the specialists had sometimes pocketed pennies for themselves or their firms from each trade by purchasing a stock and quickly flipping it for a higher price. Defense lawyers had argued that it would be absurd for highly paid specialists, many of whom have seven-figure incomes, to try to make minuscule amounts of money each day in such a way. Instead, they said, prosecutors had highlighted innocent mistakes made on fewer than 1 percent of trades each specialist handled. Prosecutors declined to comment on the ruling. In February 2007, Judge Denny Chin in Manhattan reversed a jury verdict convicting David A. Finnerty, another specialist, saying that the government had failed to prove that Mr. Finnerty acted deceptively. That decision was upheld by the appeals court. In tossing out the two convictions Wednesday, the appeals court said that lawyers on both sides had conceded that the evidence used to convict Mr. Finnerty was largely indistinguishable from the proof used to convict Mr. Hayward and Mr. Stern. The government dropped charges earlier against 7 of the 15 floor supervisors. Two others were acquitted, two pleaded guilty and one defendant remains at large.

Richard A. Grasso is one of the latter. Skip to next paragraph Brendan McDermid/Reuters Richard A. Grasso, above, is fighting to keep pay he received from the New York Stock Exchange before he resigned in 2003. On Wednesday, Mr. Grasso, the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, won another round in his almost five-year battle to keep the $187.5 million of pay he amassed during his eight years at the helm of the Big Board. The New York State Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling dismissing four of six counts originally brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, against Mr. Grasso. The decision leaves Mr. Spitzer’s successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, two claims to pursue. Since 2004, the attorney general’s office has argued that Mr. Grasso’s pay was unreasonable under New York’s nonprofit laws and that his compensation was not properly disclosed to the exchange’s board. (The exchange became a public, profit-making corporation in 2006, after Mr. Grasso had been awarded his pay.) But the Court of Appeals ruled that state law did not give the attorney general the authority to bring major parts of the case. “Mr. Grasso is gratified by the court’s decision,” said Gerson A. Zweifach, one of Mr. Grasso’s lawyers along with Mark C. Zauderer. “He always had faith in the justice system.” A spokesman for the attorney general did not return calls for comment. While the decision is certainly a win for Mr. Grasso, the war is not over. In 2006, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Grasso had breached his fiduciary duty to keep the board informed about his pay and ordered Mr. Grasso to pay back at least $100 million. “Mr. Grasso’s duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,” Justice Ramos wrote. “He failed in this duty.” Mr. Grasso is appealing that decision. “Both sides have something to look forward to,” said Richard J. Schulman, a securities lawyer for Bryan Cave. “The attorney general has a decision from the lowest court saying there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. But Grasso has slimmed down the case against him.” Mr. Grasso’s fight to keep his pay has drawn widespread attention, partly because of his rags-to-riches story. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, dropped out of Pace University and started his career as a clerk at the exchange. But he rose through the ranks, ultimately securing the chairman’s title and ringing the exchange’s famous bell with business and political luminaries. He was even featured on an episode of “Sex and the City,” ringing the bell with Sarah Jessica Parker. He protected the exchange’s open-cry auction system, which many deemed outdated and rife with human error, against the near universal move to all-electronic trading. After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Mr. Grasso helped get the exchange open again and reveled in his role as a high-profile cheerleader for the United States economy and its markets. As his star rose, so did his pay. His annual compensation, including special payments, bonuses and base salary, soared from $3 million in 1996 to more than $30 million in 2001, when he was awarded a hefty bonus for his stewardship of the exchange through Sept. 11, according to an internal report conducted by the exchange’s lawyers and Winston &amp; Strawn. In 2003, in a move that would lead to his undoing, Mr. Grasso sought to cash out some of his retirement benefits. Some directors say he expressed concern that a future board would be less willing to give him the money, a charge he contests. The compensation committee devised a contract to award him an immediate lump sum payment of $139.5 million and an additional $48 million to be paid over four years for past and future work. A storm of controversy followed. Some directors, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the head of Goldman Sachs, argued against paying out Mr. Grasso’s retirement benefits before retirement. Others said Mr. Grasso was entitled to money he had earned. By Aug. 7, 2003, when the board was scheduled to meet, some directors seemed to believe the lump sum payment would not be awarded since it was not on the agenda for a board meeting. But the issue was presented and after a debate, those present voted to pay Mr. Grasso the lump sum. The amount was disclosed to the public. Two days later, the exchange revealed that Mr. Grasso was owed an additional $48 million. As the uproar over his pay continued to ripple around the world, the board voted 13 to 7 in favor of asking Mr. Grasso to resign. Mr. Grasso will now wait to see what happens with his appeal of the two remaining charges, while Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to proceed with the remaining claims. According to the appellate court’s ruling, the attorney general must prove that Mr. Grasso knew the compensation was unreasonable and that he “violated his fiduciary duties to the New York Stock Exchange by accepting awards of excessive compensation” while in the job. Mr. Grasso’s recent victory could push the attorney general to seek a settlement. “The dismissal of these claims may ignite renewed talks of settlement,” said Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and a lawyer at McCarter &amp; English. “It’s a win for Grasso but the war is far from over.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/business/worldbusiness/25exchange.html?ref=nyseeuronext">NYSE Buys 25% of Qatar Securities Market<date>Published: June 25, 2008</date><text>LONDON  NYSE Euronext agreed on Tuesday to buy a 25 percent stake in the Qatar securities market, gaining a lead in the race against its British and German rivals to become a truly global stock exchange at a time when growth has slowed in their home markets.

Niederauer, the new chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said in an interview here. “Right now, a lot of the Chinese companies have a choice to either list locally or internationally,” Mr. Niederauer said, “and I think our general view is that it might make a lot of sense for these companies to be able to list in both places.” With an economic boom in developing countries, established stock exchanges are increasingly dependent on attracting business from companies based far from their home countries. The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext, which combined to form the world’s largest stock market group, are in a fierce rivalry with markets like the London Stock Exchange to earn fees from listing companies based in fast-developing economies like Brazil, China and Russia. Another competitor for listings from Chinese companies is the Hong Kong stock exchange, which has cultural similarities, a large pool of capital, and enthusiastic and knowledgeable investors. Many mainland companies  including PetroChina, the largest by market capitalization  have already made initial public offerings in Hong Kong. One difficulty for foreign exchanges is that the Chinese policy has been in flux, sometimes allowing overseas listings and then restricting them, said Christine Loh, chief executive of a public policy research group, Civic Exchange, and a director of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. “Everyone is looking at China and saying, ‘Hey, there are all these huge listings we want,’ ” Ms. Loh said. “But unlike in other countries, the Chinese government makes a blanket decision about whether you can even list outside of China or not, and they make that decision based on their domestic situation.” Ms. Loh said that lobbying by foreign stock exchanges was unlikely to have a direct effect in persuading the Chinese to loosen restrictions in the short term. Another difficulty for foreign exchanges seeking to break into the Chinese market for listings is that Chinese companies have been able to raise large amounts of capital on their home exchanges, like Shanghai, without the risk of falling afoul of foreign securities regulations and the publicity that could negatively affect China’s image. Even so, Ms. Loh said the situation was bound to change, particularly as Chinese companies with global ambitions want to list in regions like Europe and the United States where they aim to expand their businesses. Mr. Niederauer was unable to say how long it might take to persuade the Beijing government to change its policy on dual listings. Even so, executives from NYSE Euronext are working to show Chinese companies the advantages of listing in New York, saying that such a listing would help improve their valuations  helpful when they want to merge or make acquisitions  or increase their stature by giving them an edge over similar companies from developing economies. NYSE Euronext opened an office in Beijing last month as part of a campaign to introduce better standards of corporate governance so that Chinese companies are better prepared to list in the United States. In comments about the tight credit market, Mr. Niederauer, a former Goldman Sachs banker, said he expected that there would be more bad news. In the short term, volatility on stock markets as a result of the credit troubles has benefited exchanges like NYSE Euronext, which earn more fees on large trading volume. But Mr. Niederauer said that prolonged turbulence could hurt his business. “I don’t think it’s all positive,” he said. A deeper market downturn in the United States and a reluctance by companies to make initial stock offerings “obviously has some cyclical implications for the business,” he said. “So we’re not immune to those events.” Donald Greenlees contributed reporting from Hong Kong and David Barboza from Shanghai.

Richard A. Grasso is one of the latter. Skip to next paragraph Brendan McDermid/Reuters Richard A. Grasso, above, is fighting to keep pay he received from the New York Stock Exchange before he resigned in 2003. On Wednesday, Mr. Grasso, the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, won another round in his almost five-year battle to keep the $187.5 million of pay he amassed during his eight years at the helm of the Big Board. The New York State Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling dismissing four of six counts originally brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, against Mr. Grasso. The decision leaves Mr. Spitzer’s successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, two claims to pursue. Since 2004, the attorney general’s office has argued that Mr. Grasso’s pay was unreasonable under New York’s nonprofit laws and that his compensation was not properly disclosed to the exchange’s board. (The exchange became a public, profit-making corporation in 2006, after Mr. Grasso had been awarded his pay.) But the Court of Appeals ruled that state law did not give the attorney general the authority to bring major parts of the case. “Mr. Grasso is gratified by the court’s decision,” said Gerson A. Zweifach, one of Mr. Grasso’s lawyers along with Mark C. Zauderer. “He always had faith in the justice system.” A spokesman for the attorney general did not return calls for comment. While the decision is certainly a win for Mr. Grasso, the war is not over. In 2006, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Grasso had breached his fiduciary duty to keep the board informed about his pay and ordered Mr. Grasso to pay back at least $100 million. “Mr. Grasso’s duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,” Justice Ramos wrote. “He failed in this duty.” Mr. Grasso is appealing that decision. “Both sides have something to look forward to,” said Richard J. Schulman, a securities lawyer for Bryan Cave. “The attorney general has a decision from the lowest court saying there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. But Grasso has slimmed down the case against him.” Mr. Grasso’s fight to keep his pay has drawn widespread attention, partly because of his rags-to-riches story. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, dropped out of Pace University and started his career as a clerk at the exchange. But he rose through the ranks, ultimately securing the chairman’s title and ringing the exchange’s famous bell with business and political luminaries. He was even featured on an episode of “Sex and the City,” ringing the bell with Sarah Jessica Parker. He protected the exchange’s open-cry auction system, which many deemed outdated and rife with human error, against the near universal move to all-electronic trading. After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Mr. Grasso helped get the exchange open again and reveled in his role as a high-profile cheerleader for the United States economy and its markets. As his star rose, so did his pay. His annual compensation, including special payments, bonuses and base salary, soared from $3 million in 1996 to more than $30 million in 2001, when he was awarded a hefty bonus for his stewardship of the exchange through Sept. 11, according to an internal report conducted by the exchange’s lawyers and Winston &amp; Strawn. In 2003, in a move that would lead to his undoing, Mr. Grasso sought to cash out some of his retirement benefits. Some directors say he expressed concern that a future board would be less willing to give him the money, a charge he contests. The compensation committee devised a contract to award him an immediate lump sum payment of $139.5 million and an additional $48 million to be paid over four years for past and future work. A storm of controversy followed. Some directors, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the head of Goldman Sachs, argued against paying out Mr. Grasso’s retirement benefits before retirement. Others said Mr. Grasso was entitled to money he had earned. By Aug. 7, 2003, when the board was scheduled to meet, some directors seemed to believe the lump sum payment would not be awarded since it was not on the agenda for a board meeting. But the issue was presented and after a debate, those present voted to pay Mr. Grasso the lump sum. The amount was disclosed to the public. Two days later, the exchange revealed that Mr. Grasso was owed an additional $48 million. As the uproar over his pay continued to ripple around the world, the board voted 13 to 7 in favor of asking Mr. Grasso to resign. Mr. Grasso will now wait to see what happens with his appeal of the two remaining charges, while Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to proceed with the remaining claims. According to the appellate court’s ruling, the attorney general must prove that Mr. Grasso knew the compensation was unreasonable and that he “violated his fiduciary duties to the New York Stock Exchange by accepting awards of excessive compensation” while in the job. Mr. Grasso’s recent victory could push the attorney general to seek a settlement. “The dismissal of these claims may ignite renewed talks of settlement,” said Robert A.

Several, including the New York Stock Exchange, the Deutsche Börse, the CME Group and the Nasdaq Stock Market, are in initial talks with the Taiwan exchange, Mr. Wu said Monday in Taipei. Globally, exchanges have announced more than $50 billion of takeovers and alliances in the last three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Consolidation among exchanges has become an inevitable trend,” said Charles Chen of JF Asset Management in Taipei, Taiwan. “Such a move can help bourses add platforms or channels for trading. That will be a very positive story.” Exchanges benefited from record transactions this year after the collapse of subprime mortgages in the United States led to swings in the equity and debt markets. The Taiwan exchange is also interested in cross-shareholdings with foreign bourses, Mr. Wu said, adding that formal talks would not materialize until the planned initial public offering, which could come this year. A Deutsche Börse spokeswoman, Nina Lux, declined to comment. “Consolidation is the international trend,” he said. “We have initial talks with several foreign bourses, but the talks will take a long time.” Taiwan Stock Exchange, the island’s largest, is looking overseas to lure investment as it plans to merge with Taiwan’s smaller exchanges. Taiwan’s stock market ranks behind South Korea and ahead of Singapore among Asian exchanges, with about $691 billion of market capitalization of equities traded.

Niederauer notably took a shot at stock exchange floor workers when he said he didnt want five guys named Vinnie executing my trades. Skip to next paragraph Mel Nudelman/NYSE, via Associated Press Duncan Niederauer is the new chief executive of NYSE. Related NYSE Chief Is Chosen to Lead Merrill Lynch (November 15, 2007) Now, as the new head of NYSE Euronext, his first task will be to figure out how many guys, named Vinnie or otherwise, should remain employed by the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Niederauer, 49, was appointed chief executive of the company yesterday, succeeding John A. Thain after serving as his top lieutenant for the last seven months. Like his predecessor, Mr. Niederauer has a Goldman Sachs résumé and a no-nonsense demeanor. But in contrast to Mr. Thains deal-making skills and political savvy, Mr. Niederauer brings two decades of experience navigating arcane trading rules and market operations. That should prove crucial as the exchange copes with drastic technological change and competition from Nasdaq and other rivals. Over the last four years, Mr. Thain helped transform the New York Stock Exchange from a private club to a global public company through a series of big acquisitions. With the purchase of Archipelago Holdings in 2005, he brought the New York Stock Exchange, then 213 years old, into the modern era of electronic trading. He also started an ambitious plan to process trades using a hybrid of computer models and specialists on the stock exchange floor. And this year he led the companys expansion overseas and gave it a toehold in derivatives trading and international equities with the purchase of Euronext, a consortium of European stock exchanges. Now, it is up to Mr. Niederauer to get it all to work at a time when the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, which can process trades faster, are taking market share. Technology has turned the trading floor into a sideshow, leaving trading floor specialists at the exchange anxious that they will become mere extras on CNBC. Deal-making is important, but it takes a back seat to stopping the bleeding, said Benn Steil, an expert on stock exchanges at the Council on Foreign Relations, a research organization. The advantage Duncan brings to the table is that he really knows the exchange business from the trading side. Mr. Niederauer, who was not made available to comment, will decide the course of the exchanges expansion into derivatives trading. He will also have to finish merging the operations of Euronext. Most important, he must improve the efficiency of the companys trading technology while contending with the exchanges outspoken specialists, whose clout has diminished as they now handle only a small fraction of trades. At stake is the future of the hybrid trading model introduced by Mr. Thain  and the future of humans on the exchange floor. Duncan can sit across the table from a specialist and can sit across from the table from a head of trading at a mutual fund or hedge fund and understand their issues, said Douglas Atkin, a longtime electronic trading executive who now runs Majestic Research, an independent financial research company in New York. He is a very pragmatic guy, he added. He doesnt have a religious view of getting rid of the specialist or keeping the specialists. While Mr. Thain earned the respect of Wall Street investors, his relationship with floor traders grew contentious over the years. Where Mr. Thain was seen as a shrewd but aloof politician, so far Mr. Niederauer has impressed some floor workers with his outgoing personality and straight-shooting style. He accepts challenges in dealing with the problems, said James Maguire Sr., a longtime floor trader. He reaches out and is readily available. When you have a concern, he says, Give me a call. Mr. Niederauer is also respected for his knowledge of trading operations. Since earning a bachelors degree from Colgate University and an M.B.A. at Emory University, he has spent more than two decades working with stock markets. He joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and rose to the top of its equities trading division, moving it aggressively into electronic transactions. Then, after Goldman bought the floor trading firm Spear, Leads &amp; Kellogg in 2000, he was put in charge of Goldmans global trade-clearing operations, giving him a taste of the trading floor. At the same time, he took an active role in shaping the business strategy as a board member at Archipelago Holdings, which NYSE bought two years ago and in which Goldman held a big stake as a minority investor. In April, he joined NYSE Euronext as its president and one of its chief operating officers, putting him in line for NYSEs top job.

Thain Multimedia Yesterday, Mr. Thain, who had risen to co-president of Goldman Sachs but left for the stock exchange, was named chairman and chief executive of Merrill, where he will compete against his former colleagues. Repairing the reputation of Merrill, one of the biggest casualties of the recent turmoil in the financial markets, will test the financial and political mettle of Mr. Thain, 52. Merrills former chief executive, E. Stanley ONeal, was forced to resign two weeks ago after announcing an $8.4 billion write-down and approaching a rival bank to discuss a merger. Although Mr. Thains name was on a short list of candidates from the start, his hiring still took Wall Street by surprise. Many top-level executives had expected that the job would be offered to Laurence D. Fink, the founder of BlackRock, a large investment firm partly owned by Merrill. But according to people briefed on Merrills decision, Mr. Thain was selected, not just because of his success at the exchange but also because of his understanding of risk management systems at Goldman, which has largely avoided the problems plaguing its rivals. Merrill directors personally wooed Mr. Thain at his home in Rye, N.Y. At 5 p.m. Sunday, Ann N. Reese, a Merrill director who lives nearby, stopped by his house for a cup of English tea. For two hours, she and Alberto Cribiore, the firms interim nonexecutive chairman, encouraged Mr. Thain to join the firm. Mr. Thain had also met with members of a search committee seeking to fill the top job at Citigroup, whose chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, resigned in the wake of multibillion-dollar write-downs related to subprime mortgages. Fixing Merrills problems will take some time, Mr. Thain said yesterday, because the issues troubling the overall mortgage market are likely to continue for another 6 to 12 months. We have not seen the bottom, he said. Mr. Thain went to the NYSE in 2004 and is widely credited with modernizing and expanding the 215-year-old exchange. He stepped into turmoil there, including a scandal over the $187.5 million pay package of Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman, and a federal investigation into trading practices. Slightly more than a year after he arrived, he executed a deal to merge with Archipelago, an all-electronic platform, converting the nonprofit institution into a public one. He then took on the Deutsche Börse to win Euronext, a pan-European exchange, which ultimately merged with the New York Exchange. The exchange was in flux and he resuscitated the place with the acquisition of Archipelago and the merger with Euronext, said John R. Jakobson, a former member and a current shareholder. It was on life support then, and its in first-rate condition today. The exchange went public in March 2006 at $67 a share; it closed yesterday at $86.74. While Mr. Thain boasts an impressive résumé, he is known more as an analytical technocrat. While he was not popular on the exchanges floor, analysts say he was respected. For example, the Archipelago deal was criticized when announced, but he ultimately got traders to vote for it. Hes articulate and can consensus-build, Richard H. Repetto, an analyst at Sandler ONeill, said. He had to deal with members as they saw their jobs become extinct. Mr. Thain started his career at Goldman as an investment banker and went on to work in mortgage securities, ultimately running the desk in the late 1980s. In 1994 he was promoted to chief financial officer and head of operations, technology and finance. In 2003, he became co-president and co-chief operating officer with John Thornton. He was considered a candidate to run Goldman Sachs after Henry M. Paulson Jr., now the Treasury secretary. But Mr. Thornton left Goldman and Lloyd C. Blankfein, then the head of the firms powerful fixed- income group, was on the ascent. Mr. Thain, when he was contacted by John S. Reed, opted for the chance to run the exchange. (Mr. Blankfein now runs Goldman.) Mr. Thain now faces a formidable task at Merrill. Under Mr. ONeal, the bank aggressively entered into new and riskier businesses, including underwriting collateralized debt obligations, originating subprime loans and expanding its proprietary trading operations. Mr. ONeal also reached out to G. Kennedy Thompson, the chief executive of Wachovia to explore a merger, an approach that might have been acceptable if the board had not been reeling from the magnitude of the loss. After the merger approach became known, Mr. ONeal was forced to resign. Although Merrill did not disclose what Mr. Thain would be paid, it is expected to be more than what Mr. ONeal received. Mr. ONeal earned $70 million in the last five years, and took home an additional $161.5 million in stock he had deferred and in retirement benefits. Mr. Thain took a pay cut to go to the exchange in early 2004: he made more than $20 million at Goldman in 2003 but agreed to a starting salary and bonus of $4 million at the exchange. He will leave with $820,000 of deferred compensation, $3.6 million in restricted stock and options on top of the $14.9 million he made at the exchange, according to Equilar and James F. Reda &amp; Associates. Some challenges that Mr. Thain will face will seem familiar: rebuilding risk management and continuing to build the investment bank. But managing a huge brokerage business  Merrills is the largest in the United States  will be new. And he will have to learn that portion of the business at a time when the subprime mortgage crisis continues to cause Wall Street to reel. When asked if he was nervous about joining a company whose board oversaw the mess it is in, he said: It was a very important question for me to understand, and I got comfortable with their answer. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: November 16, 2007 Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the selection of John A.

The share price jumped after the chairman of Nymex Holdings, Richard Schaeffer, said late Tuesday that the company had had preliminary discussions with a possible buyer. He said any deal must offer a meaningful premium to the current stock price. Nymex is the operator of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy market. Its shares rose $7.28, or more than 6 percent, to $126.06. There has been intense speculation about the future of Nymex for the last year as global financial markets consolidate. Commodities and futures exchanges are considered the most likely targets for acquisition as bigger stock markets look to expand their businesses. Executives of the Nasdaq Stock Market and NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, have stated an interest in acquiring an exchange to increase their trading of commodities and stock options. In April, Deutsche Börse announced a deal to buy the International Securities Exchange. Nymex did not identify its partner in the discussions, but there have been reports that Mr. Schaeffer is holding talks with the New York Stock Exchange. Spokesmen from both exchanges declined to comment. David Easthope, an analyst with the consulting firm Celent, said Nymex officials ''don't want to be left out of the game; they see all this consolidation occurring and recognize the time is perfect to find a partner and strike a deal.'' ''They could be in talks with NYSE, maybe the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,'' he continued, ''and they've made public there are discussions going on in case someone else wants to come in and start a bidding war.'' Mr. Schaeffer has made a number of comments about his company's interest in finding the right partner, and has cited the benefits of a deal with the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2DB113EF932A25754C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=nyseeuronext">S.E.C. Eases a Restriction on Stock Symbols<date>Published: July 11, 2007</date><text>The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a plan yesterday to allow companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange to retain their three-letter ticker symbols should they transfer to Nasdaq. Traditionally, investors have been able to differentiate among companies traded on Nasdaq and other exchanges based on how many letters a stock symbol contains. The American Stock Exchange uses three characters, while Nasdaq companies use four or five characters. The Nasdaq has argued that allowing companies to retain their three-character symbols would increase competition. It would have let Charles Schwab keep its SCH symbol when it switched to Nasdaq last year. It now trades under the ticker symbol SCHW. The S.E.C. said in its decision that removing the three-letter symbol rule would ''remove a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate.'' The regulator also said it would reduce confusion among investors of companies that might switch. The new rule will not apply to N.Y.S.E. companies that have symbols with one or two letters, and it will not allow Nasdaq to list new companies with three-letter tickers.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EFDC113EF932A25754C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=nyseeuronext">WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING; Nyse Joins Inquiry On Abn Amro Trades<date>Published: July 11, 2007</date><text>NYSE Euronext has joined Dutch and British financial authorities in examining trading patterns of ABN Amro's shares and American depositary receipts just before the multibillion-dollar bidding war over ABN became public, the bank said.

The upheaval in the specialist business has hurt rivals like Van der Moolen Holding, which cut more than a third of its staff on the New York Stock Exchange floor, and Bear Stearns, which took a $225 million charge after cutting the value of its specialist unit. LaBranche, which hired the New York investment bank Freeman &amp; Company Securities and the law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, also announced the sale of its business at the American Stock Exchange for an undisclosed sum.

No, really. Every day, potentially millions of dollars are at stake as electronic communications whiz through the air. Yet that ever-expanding number of ways to communicate  like hand-held BlackBerrys, text messages and instant messaging  have raised concerns about the spread of confidential information through unsecure devices. In response, the industrys two self-policing groups, N.Y.S.E. Regulation and NASD, are expected today to release proposed guidelines for the regulation of written electronic communications, including internal and external exchanges. The guidelines represent nearly two years of work by a committee of N.Y.S.E. Regulation and NASD, Wall Street firms and lawyers, as well as contributions by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They are intended to clarify how forms of communication unimaginable when the rules were last revised, in 1998, fit into existing regulations, said Grace Vogel, the executive vice president of N.Y.S.E. Regulation who led the committee. But some outside the committee said that regulation and enforcement would undoubtedly follow. I expect that the codification of these best practices has little practical effect other than in bringing regulatory actions against their members, Ron S. Geffner, a lawyer at Sadis &amp; Goldberg who previous worked at the S.E.C., said. James D. Cox, a professor of corporate and securities law at Duke, said the new proposal was a small but important step. It wont be the last whack at the problem, Professor Cox said. But its a modest beginning. Though Wall Street has learned the consequences of paying too little attention to messages zipping through its corporate pipelines  ask Merrill Lynch about Henry Blodget  other ways of communicating have cropped up faster than regulators have been able to address them. What has emerged in the latest revision is a series of recommendations on how to monitor text-based communications from these firms. The overarching principle: if firms cannot supervise or review the messages, or if the sender cannot be identified, they should consider blocking them from the workplace. The goal was not to deprive bankers, traders and brokers of their BlackBerrys or market terminals, said Ben A. Indek, a partner at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius and a committee member, but to offer companies guidance on how to monitor their use. While many firms have already addressed some of these concerns  like blocking sites for personal e-mail messages  Ms. Vogel said that many Wall Street executives felt that regulators needed to address the issue more broadly. In addition, the guidelines suggest that brokers should limit the use of their personal cellphones and that companies should not allow the use of instant messaging or pin messaging if they cannot monitor it properly. Among the discussions at the inaugural meeting was defining electronic communications. The task took three hours, Ms. Vogel said. One of the ground rules the committee worked under was that any proposals would emerge as principles rather than rules. The decision, members said, underscored concerns about cost, as smaller firms worried that they could not institute the types of systems used at larger companies. Instead, the proposal urges firms to consider what is appropriate for their size and business models. We didnt necessarily want mechanistic guidance, that you must look at X number of e-mails, Marc Menchel, executive vice president and general counsel at NASD, said. Another reason was a recognition that a list of guidelines could more easily accommodate the rapid evolution of technology. Rather than a list that prohibited means of communication, the guidelines lay the groundwork for a wider scope, not limiting regulators from addressing the BlackBerrys of tomorrow. Gaining consensus within the committee was challenging, especially on the inclusion of internal e-mail communications, an item flagged by NASD and the S.E.C. Several firms pointed out that certain kinds of messages, like those between bankers and analysts, are prohibited.

Grasso get to keep his money after all? A New York appeals court certainly gave Mr. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, hope this week when it dismissed four legal claims brought against him by the New York attorney general. By turning back a claim brought by the attorney general that Mr. Grasso's pay was unreasonable under the law governing nonprofits, the judges, who ruled 3-to-2, cast doubt on the attorney general's authority to try the case. Now lawyers for the attorney general will have a higher legal bar to clear in persuading a jury that Mr. Grasso should have known his pay was unreasonable. Last year, a lower court ruled that Mr. Grasso, who was forced out of his job in 2003, should return as much as $112 million of the $187.5 million he accumulated during his eight years as chairman. The judge ruled that Mr. Grasso violated his duty as chairman by keeping his board in the dark regarding his escalating pay. That decision is being appealed. Andrew Cuomo, the current attorney general, has said he expects to appeal. While the verdict raises the possibility of a settlement, such an outcome is by no means assured. LANDON THOMAS Jr.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/04/business/worldbusiness/04exchange.html?ref=nyseeuronext">Trans-Atlantic Exchange to Be Listed Today<date>Published: April 4, 2007</date><text>PARIS, April 3  The chiefs of the merged New York Stock Exchange and Euronext said Tuesday, on the eve of the opening day of trading of its shares, that they were determined to create a truly global market that would include operations in China. “NYSE Euronext is an adventure that is still only at its beginnings,” said Jean-François Théodore, the deputy chief executive of NYSE Euronext, the first trans-Atlantic exchange. The combined markets have the “capacity to influence and attract others,” Mr. Théodore added, and would “favor further stock market consolidation, particularly in Europe.” John A. Thain, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said the company planned to expand its operations in Asia. Euronext agreed to merge with the NYSE last June and shareholders approved the deal in December. As of Friday, holders of 91.42 percent of Euronext had tendered their shares to NYSE Euronext and the offer has been extended. On Wednesday the new stock begins trading in Paris and New York. NYSE Euronext executives say the total capitalization of companies listed on the exchange is about $28.5 trillion, greater than the combined total for the world’s next four-largest exchanges  the London Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse, which runs the Frankfurt stock exchange. Still, NYSE Euronext is expected to face stiff competition from smaller and more nimble newcomers as well as from established rivals as they consolidate and as Europe introduces regulations allowing new rivals. Competition could also come from a group of banks that have pledged to set up a share-trading system known as Turquoise, adding to pressure on established exchanges to lower prices and capture new business. Mr. Thain emphasized that one motivation in forming NYSE Euronext was to win business from companies shying away from the United States, where strict regulations were introduced after a wave of accounting scandals. “If a company isn’t going to list in the U.S.,” he said, “we want them to list on Euronext.” But he also made the point that some Russian companies might not be welcomed. “We are very concerned about the quality of corporate governance” in Russia, Mr. Thain said. “I think with a number of Russian companies these things are called into question.” Mr. Thain and Mr. Théodore said they would welcome more European exchanges like Borsa Italiana in Milan as part of the so-called Euronext model, which has allowed cities like Brussels and Lisbon to retain their bourses while joining a Europe-wide system. But Mr. Thain said he saw the greatest opportunities for NYSE Euronext in China, where he expected the authorities to make it possible for foreign companies to own minority stakes in stock exchanges, perhaps within the next two years. “At the moment the Chinese government would not allow us to own a piece of, say, the Shanghai stock exchange,” he said. “That is what I hope will change over time.” NYSE Euronext already has a strategic alliance in Japan with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and it owns a 5 percent stake in the National Stock Exchange of India. To overcome skepticism in Europe about domination of Euronext by the NYSE, the structure of the new company was finely balanced during negotiations last year. The American headquarters are in New York with the international headquarters in Paris and a center for derivatives operations in London, with other offices in Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The company has equal representation of Europeans and Americans on the board and management positions. When the chairman is European, the chief executive has to be American, and vice versa.

The announcement follows similar agreements in the last six months as exchanges try to broaden their market reach, increase volume and lower operating costs. Last week, Deutsche Börse of Germany bought a 5 percent stake in the Bombay Stock Exchange for $42 million. The London exchange faces stronger competition after the NYSE Group last year agreed to buy the Paris-based Euronext for $13.3 billion. It has fought off four takeover attempts in two years, including the most recent one by the Nasdaq Stock Market for $5.3 billion. Clara Furse, the London exchanges chief executive, has since said that the exchange will focus on collaborations and other opportunities. Stock exchanges around the world are under pressure from shareholders and their clients to consolidate as they are looking for lower fees and more liquidity, said Kevin Lyne-Smith, a fund manager at Julius Baer Holding based in Switzerland. We are only partway through the process. The agreement comes less than a month after the Tokyo exchange signed a nonexclusive strategic cooperation agreement with the N.Y.S.E., the worlds largest stock exchange. The Tokyo exchange also held talks with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest futures trading market in the United States, about a possible alliance. The London and Tokyo exchanges said they would also share information on technology and develop trading services for growth companies. The two exchanges also plan to promote and develop new trading products. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is an immensely important global market, Chris Gibson-Smith, the London Stock Exchange chairman, said in a statement. For the Tokyo exchange, where the daily trading volume is about 2.7 trillion yen ($22.4 billion), the deal will help broaden its presence ahead of a planned initial public offering in 2009. It may also improve investor confidence in the exchange, whose reputation has suffered from trading errors and other problems. In 2005, a computer system breakdown interrupted trading for hours on two occasions. Mizuho Financial Group, Japans second-largest bank, is seeking 41.5 billion yen in compensation for losses after the exchange failed to stop a botched trade. The Tokyo exchange will invest 30 billion yen in its computer systems by the end of 2009, its chief executive, Taizo Nishimuro, has said. The Tokyo exchange, where companies like Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are traded, faced competition after Nomura Holdings, Japans largest securities firm, bought the American electronic brokerage operation Instinet for $1.2 billion this year. That deal gave Nomura access to hedge fund clients. In October, the Goldman Sachs Group joined Japans first after-hours stock-trading system, run by the online brokerage unit of Mitsubishi UFJ. The London Stock Exchange, where £26.6 billion of shares are traded each day, signed an agreement this week with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to help Israeli companies attract more foreign investment. In November, it reported that profit for the six months that ended in September more than doubled to £54.1 million, up from £24.4 million in the period a year earlier, because of an increase in electronic trading and higher revenue from initial public offerings.

Less than one half of 1 percent of the London exchanges stockholders responded to Nasdaqs offer to acquire their shares for $24.35, leaving the American exchange well short of the majority it needed to take control. The bid, for a total of $5.3 billion, had brought about much public bickering between the two companies, with the London exchange calling the price too low. The failed takeover leaves both the Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange without a strong international presence at a time when stock trading has become an increasingly global business. NYSE Group, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, for instance, has made deals with three foreign exchanges within the last year. One of those deals was a limited alliance last month with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is now in talks with the London Stock Exchange over what might become a similar relationship, according to one Tokyo exchange official. If the London and Tokyo exchanges paired up, it could put even more pressure on Nasdaq to find a foreign partner. The new arrangement between the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo exchange includes plans for joint listings of securities and exchange-traded funds, the exchange of trading technology and  at some later time  the possibility of future investments in each others shares. The Tokyo exchange is the largest and wealthiest trading center in Asia and the second-largest in the world, after the New York Stock Exchange. That alliance was announced Jan. 31 during a visit to the New York exchange by the Tokyo exchanges president, Taizo Nishimuro. A report by the Kyodo news agency in Japan that Mr. Nishimuro may visit London soon, perhaps in late February, has led to speculation that a similar deal may be imminent. The London exchange has rejected a string of suitors over the past year, despite pressure from hedge funds and other private investors. After the deadline for the Nasdaq bid passed, the London exchange issued a statement saying that it looks forward to fulfilling its vision to be the worlds capital market, without the distraction of ill-considered approaches which fail to understand the value of the business. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaqs chief executive, responded to the setback by saying that his exchange will continue to pursue other opportunities to build on its existing position as the worlds largest electronic equities exchange. Under British takeover rules, Nasdaq cannot make another bid for the London exchange for a year unless someone else does so. Nasdaq still holds about 28 percent of the London exchanges outstanding shares, a stake so large that it would make it hard for anyone else to buy the London exchange without its approval. Even so, the New York Stock Exchange is seen as a potential bidder. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, John A. Thain, the Big Boards chief executive, praised the London Stock Exchange as having the second strongest brand in world stock markets, behind his own. Mr. Thain said that he was not interested in any new mergers until the New York exchange completed integrating its operations with those of Euronext, the Paris-based European marketplace. That process will take about a year, he said. People informed about Nasdaqs strategy would say only that the exchange intended to keep its options open. Holding on to its London Stock Exchange stake, which was largely financed with borrowed funds, would be inconsistent with Nasdaqs argument over the past year that the London exchanges shares were overvalued. Keeping the shares doesnt make sense, said William C. Freund, a former chief economist at the New York Stock Exchange and now the director of the Center for the Study of Securities Markets at Pace University. It was a long shot to begin with. I would expect them to sell. If there is a winner in the weekends drama, Professor Freund said, it is perhaps the New York Stock Exchange. There has been an intense competition among markets globally, but particularly between the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, he said. It seems to me this puts Nasdaq significantly behind in the race. Besides its alliance with Tokyo and merger with Euronext, the New York Stock Exchange has also bought a 5 percent stake in the National Stock Exchange, Indias largest market. Its Tokyo alliance could lead to a more substantial tie-up after 2009, when the Japanese exchange is scheduled to make its own initial public offering. It had originally planned to do this last year, but delayed the listing after embarrassing and costly computer problems that repeatedly paralyzed trading.

That is good news for most people, including most workers, who are seeing robust wage growth, but was not good enough for the chief of one consumer electronics company, who was shoved aside for poor performance. BACK IN THE SADDLE After more than a year of mounting problems at Dell, Kevin B. Rollins resigned as chief executive and a director, and its founder and chairman, Michael S. Dell, returned to the corner office. About a year after Mr. Rollins succeeded Mr. Dell as chief executive in 2004, the company began to disclose a series of problems, including accounting irregularities now under review by federal regulators and prosecutors. Revenue growth also slowed, and Dell lost its lead in the personal computer market to its archrival, Hewlett-Packard. Dell said it expected that its revenue and earnings performance would disappoint investors when it reports fourth-quarter results on March 1. GO-GO GROWTH Just after the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a surprisingly fast 3.5 percent annual rate in the final quarter of 2006, the Federal Reserve said that it would leave short-term interest rates unchanged and suggested that it would keep them steady for some time. Exports led the economic expansion, increasing at an annual pace of 10 percent and accounting for almost half of the increase in gross domestic product. Consumers did their part, spending 4.4 percent more in the fourth quarter of 2006 than in the period a year earlier. Robust spending is likely to continue. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index edged up in January to its highest level in five years. PRESIDENTIAL CAUTION In a rare Wall Street visit by a sitting chief executive  one sitting in the White House, at least  President Bush called on corporate boards to tie their chief executives’ compensation closer to companies’ performance and hold them more accountable for companies’ problems. His comments, made at the Federal Hall National Memorial in Lower Manhattan, were met with silence from a crowd of business leaders gathered to hear what the White House billed as a “State of the Economy” speech. Mr. Bush received a warmer response later, on a surprise visit to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Bush is scheduled to unveil his annual budget on Monday. PROFIT GUSHER Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, said its profit rose 9 percent last year to a record $39.5 billion, the largest annual profit for an American company. Its closest publicly traded competitor, Royal Dutch Shell, reported an annual profit of $25.4 billion, also a record. Much of the profit rise was attributable directly to high oil prices, which averaged $66 last year, $10 higher than in 2005, according to Citigroup. Oil prices peaked at $77 in July, but declined amid generally warm weather. They have recently resumed rising. With higher energy prices, analysts say the profits bonanza will continue. DEAL OF STEEL In another major step in the global consolidation of steel makers, Tata Steel of India agreed to pay at least $12.2 billion for a British-Dutch competitor, the Corus Group, winning a bidding war with Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional of Brazil. Corus, which was created in 1999 through a merger of British Steel and Royal Hoogovens of the Netherlands, has more than 47,000 workers and plants in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Steel makers are buying one another to gain leverage in negotiations for labor and raw material. Mittal Steel, for example, bought another big European company, Arcelor, for $38.3 million last year to become the world’s biggest steel maker. Mining companies will continue to raise prices for iron ore  a primary raw material in steel making  in the near future, economists said. PAPER TRANSACTION Newspaper publishers are not alone in being hurt by the rise of the Web. Newsprint makers are suffering mightily, too. Two of North America’s struggling newsprint makers, Abitibi Consolidated and Bowater, agreed to merge in a stock swap that they said should allow annual operating savings of $250 million. Paper makers want to cut costs because energy costs have risen while newsprint consumption in the United States has fallen 26 percent since 1999 because of declining circulation and publishers’ attempts to lower costs with narrower newspapers. Several modern mills being built in China may flood North America with cheap paper until domestic demand grows enough to absorb their output. GROUNDED A long-anticipated consolidation of the American airline industry was set back when US Airways withdrew its $10.2 billion offer for Delta Air Lines. US Airways gave up on its hostile takeover after having failed to win over Delta’s creditors, including the Boeing Company and the federal pension agency. Delta is in bankruptcy court protection, but said this week that it had arranged $2.5 billion for its exit as soon as this spring. Delta will eventually find a merger partner, analysts said. The most likely candidate is Northwest Airlines, which is also operating in bankruptcy. GLOBAL AMBITIONS The New York Stock Exchange formed an alliance with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, giving the New York Exchange access to the world’s second-largest economy amid a worldwide consolidation of capital markets. The nonexclusive pact lets the two markets cooperate on developing financial products, mutual listings and technology. The deal in Tokyo comes a few weeks after the Big Board said it was part of a team of investors that bought a 20 percent stake in India’s largest financial market, the National Stock Exchange in Mumbai. The New York and Tokyo markets could merge after the Japanese exchange becomes a public company in 2009.

Skip to next paragraph Richard Drew/Associated Press Taizo Nishimuro, chief executive of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, left, and John Thain, chief of the New York Stock Exchange, announced an alliance between the worlds two biggest stock markets Wednesday. The alliance calls for cooperation on joint listings, trading technology and marketing, with the possibility of investing in each other in the future. I strongly believe this agreement will be a good starting point for a much stronger tie-up, Taizo Nishimuro, chief executive of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said at a news conference at the New York Exchange. Its is the third international deal that the NYSE Group has announced in the last 12 months. Last spring, it merged with Euronext, the Paris-based European exchange, creating the first trans-Atlantic exchange. More recently it bought a 5 percent stake in the National Stock Exchange, Indias largest marketplace. All three of those deals, and the exchanges merger with the electronic trading operator Archipelago in 2005, were forged under the stewardship of John A. Thain, who became chief executive in January 2004, at a time of turmoil and uncertainty about the exchanges future. The exchanges nonexclusive alliance with Tokyo loosely defined and less substantive than its merger with Euronext or its ownership stake in Indias national stock exchange  is an agreement to work together, the chief executives from the two exchanges said. Working groups are in place to examine possible linkages in areas like trading technology, cross-listings, new products including exchange-traded funds and areas of corporate governance and regulation, Mr. Thain said. Over the last few years, global exchanges have been radically transformed from staid not-for-profit membership organizations to for-profit, publicly traded technology hubs, struggling to capture soaring volumes and increasingly complex financial products. Given the limited number of exchanges in the world and their monopolylike characteristics, investors have leaped at the opportunity to own a piece of what are considered by many to be toll roads for traders. Hedge funds, private pools of capital that control half to a third of trading on these exchanges, have been some of the biggest investors. The exchanges themselves have been in a race to gobble one another up or strike alliances, seeking to corner the valuable liquidity that makes markets function. The Deutsche Börse lost out to NYSE in the bidding for Euronext, and NYSEs rival, Nasdaq, has made a hostile offer for the London Stock Exchange, so far without success. Yesterdays deal is expected to have more immediate importance for Tokyo than for NYSE. The Tokyo exchange is trying to restore its reputation after a series of embarrassing computer-related failures in late 2005 and early 2006 that paralyzed trading and resulted in huge losses for one brokerage firm. Those failures shook investors faith in the exchange, Asias largest and most sophisticated market and No. 2 globally after New York. The exchange has struggled to win back investor confidence, postponing its initial offering until 2009 and vowing to have its outdated computer trading system replaced by then. Analysts speculated that the Tokyo exchanges biggest motivation in seeking an alliance with New York was to bolster its prestige and get outside help in improving its trading systems. The T.S.E. is still trying to put its house back in order and regain investor confidence, said Neil Katkov, a Tokyo-based analyst specializing in trading systems at Celent Communications A tie-up with a major foreign exchange makes them look competitive again. Analysts said the Tokyo exchange still faced a host of problems. The computer manufacturer chosen to build the new trading system, Fujitsu, also built the current problem-plagued system. And the new system, which is expected to cost some $300 million, will not be as fast or investor-friendly as the New York exchanges current computers  which Nasdaq has frequently derided as antiquated and slow. For the NYSE Group, an alliance with the Tokyo exchange brings access to Asias largest market, with a capitalization of $4.6 trillion  about one-third of the New York Exchanges. Tokyos stock market has re-emerged as an enormously popular place to invest. Foreign investors have been net buyers in recent years, drawn by rebounding stock and asset prices as Japans economy finally recovers from a long slump in the 1990s. In recent years, Japanese stock indexes have outperformed American indexes. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index has doubled since the start of 2003, compared with the Dow Jones industrial averages rise of about 50 percent during the period. On Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 17,490.19, close to a six-year high. Analysts said the Tokyo market would probably benefit from higher profits as more companies overhaul themselves in the face of rising Chinese and other Asian competition. They said another boost would come as more of Japans wealth of private savings and pension funds moves into stocks to take advantage of the bull market. This and the foreign money pouring in have given Tokyo robust daily trading volumes similar to New Yorks. On Monday, 1.49 billion shares were traded in Tokyo, compared with 1.54 billion on the New York exchange.

Sixty-four percent of members of NASD approved combining its regulatory operations with those of NYSE to create a single watchdog, NASD said in a statement yesterday. NASD, a private-sector provider of financial regulatory services with 5,058 brokerage firms, said almost 83 percent of eligible members voted during a 33-day election period. Its a great step forward for efficient and effective regulation, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul S. Atkins, said before the results were announced. The more duplication you have out there, it makes life more complicated and more costly. The combination, first announced on Nov. 28, was backed by the largest Wall Street firms, who cited the cost and redundancy of complying with rules enforced by two industry watchdogs. Officials, including the S.E.C.s chairman, Christopher Cox, said the change would improve the policing of financial markets. The combined organization will include NASDs 2,400 workers and about 470 employees from the NYSEs member regulation, arbitration and enforcement teams, NASD said. The name of the new company has not been decided. More Articles in Business »</text></article></page></root>
