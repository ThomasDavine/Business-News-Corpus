Panel<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>A federal advisory committee voted 9 to 6 on Tuesday that a first-of-its-kind diabetes drug should not be approved for use because of safety concerns, including a possible increased risk of breast and bladder cancers. The advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration said that while the drug, dapagliflozin, had some attractive features as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, there were too many unanswered questions about safety and in which type of patients it should best be used. The drug, being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca, could become the first to work to lower blood sugar by causing it to be excreted in the urine. Many other companies are in a heated race to develop similar drugs, which are called SGLT2 inhibitors. “While I really liked the concept, we just don’t have enough right now, in my opinion, to ensure safety and efficacy and how to use it,” said Dr. David M. Capuzzi, a professor at Thomas Jefferson University and a member of the committee, who voted no. The F.D.A. is not bound to follow the advice of its committees, and it has often said that when a vote is close it pays more attention to the discussion than to the final tally. Still, it would be highly unusual for the agency to immediately approve a drug after a negative vote. The agency is supposed to make a decision by Oct. 28. Because of safety concerns, analysts had been somewhat lukewarm on the prospects for the drug. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at the ISI Group, projected peak annual global sales of $735 million in 2019. He estimated after the vote that the drug had only a 20 percent chance of approval, and he lowered his projected 2015 earnings for Bristol-Myers by 2 percent. Bristol’s shares rose 15 cents yesterday to $28.81, though the committee vote did not come until after the close of regular trading. In the first hour of after-hours trading, the stock fell 21 cents to $28.60. AstraZeneca’s American depositary receipts were unchanged in regular trading and rose 8 cents, to $48.81, after hours. More than 25 million Americans are said to have diabetes, most of them with type 2, which was once called adult onset diabetes and is often associated with obesity. Some doctors on the committee said that there was a need for new drugs and that dapagliflozin would be useful in treating type 2 diabetes. One reason, they said, was that its mechanism of action was different from many other diabetes drugs, which work by affecting the supply or use of insulin. That could make it easier to combine dapagliflozin with other drugs. Also, since so many calories are excreted through the urine, dapagliflozin causes a small weight loss while many other diabetes drugs cause weight gains. “Finding anti-diabetic agents that are weight-neutral is going to be a huge advance,” said Dr. Ellen W. Seely, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who voted in favor of approval. “Although there is a scare factor to the word ‘cancer,’ ” she said, diabetes “is a devastating disease.” Several committee members said they could have voted either way. “I changed my mind about four times in the last 10 seconds,” said Erica H. Brittain, a statistician at the National Institutes of Health who voted no. The biggest safety concern was that in clinical trials, patients who got the drug were more likely to develop breast and bladder cancers than those in the control groups. About 0.4 percent of women taking the drug got breast cancer, compared with 0.1 percent of the women in the control groups. About 0.3 percent of men getting the drug got bladder cancer, compared with about 0.05 percent of men in the control groups. The numbers were very small, however, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions. Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca argued that many of the cancers occurred too soon to have been caused by the drugs. Still, some committee members said the imbalance could not be overlooked. “The breast and bladder cancers, I can’t dismiss as being irrelevant or minor,” said Dr. Doris B. Strader of the University of Vermont. Another safety concern was that there was one case of liver damage probably caused by the drug. And some committee members said Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca had not done enough studies of how exactly the drug affected the kidneys. Some also said the clinical trials did not include enough minorities and very old patients, demographics that were prone to diabetes. The committee members agreed that more study of the possible cancer risks and other safety questions would be needed. Those who voted no mainly believed that the studies needed to be done before approval, even though that might delay approval by years. Those who voted yes tended to think it would be impossible to do large enough studies to rule out the cancer risk before approval. Rather they said the studies could be done after approval, in part by observing the effects of the drug as it is used.A federal advisory committee voted 9 to 6 on Tuesday that a first-of-its-kind diabetes drug should not be approved for use because of safety concerns, including a possible increased risk of breast and bladder cancers.

Advisory Panel<date>Published: July 17, 2011</date><text>New diabetes drugs are being developed that reduce blood sugar in a straightforward way — by causing it to be excreted in the urine. On Tuesday, a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration is to consider whether the first of those drugs can overcome safety concerns and reach the market. The outcome of the F.D.A. review is far from certain. The drug, dapagliflozin, might raise the risk of breast and bladder cancer, liver damage and infections of the genitals and urinary tract, according to an F.D.A. examination of the data posted on the agency’s Web site on Friday. Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca, the co-developers of dapagliflozin, are in the lead to bring these drugs, so-called SGLT2 inhibitors, to market. Others developing such drugs include Johnson &amp; Johnson; the team of Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim; Lexicon Pharmaceuticals; Isis Pharmaceuticals; and several Japanese companies including Astellas Pharma, the Chugai Pharmaceutical Company and the Taisho Pharmaceutical Company. Currently, only a tiny amount of glucose that is filtered by the kidneys is excreted in the urine; the rest is returned to the bloodstream. This mechanism apparently evolved to help the body preserve a vital source of energy. The job of returning glucose to the bloodstream is performed mainly by a protein called the sodium glucose co-transporter 2. By inhibiting SGLT2, the drugs cause a substantial increase in the amount of glucose that flows out in the urine. At least in principle, this does not appear to be dangerous. There is a rare genetic disease in which people do not have functioning SGLT2. They have very high sugar levels in their urine but appear otherwise to be generally healthy. In clinical trials, dapagliflozin, a once-a-day pill, was about as effective as other types of diabetes drugs in lowering blood sugar. According to the F.D.A., however, the drug does not work in patients with moderate to severe kidney impairment. Experts say that SGLT2 inhibitors would be a useful addition because many diabetics go through various drugs, often more than one at a time, to try to control their blood sugar. “It’s not a must-have, but it’s a nice thing,” said Dr. Jay S. Skyler, deputy director of the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami. “I’d like to have it in my toolbox.” A potential advantage of these drugs is that their mechanism of action is independent of insulin, making it potentially easy to combine SGLT2 inhibitors with other drugs. Many other diabetes drugs work either by providing the body with insulin, inducing the pancreas to secrete more insulin or making the body more sensitive to insulin. Moreover, because so many calories are now flowing out in the urine, the SGLT2 inhibitors help people lose a little weight. That could be of some benefit because many people with diabetes are overweight and because some other diabetes drugs can cause weight gain. In clinical trials, patients receiving dapagliflozin lost an average of about five pounds more than those getting a placebo after six months. They also experienced a slight reduction in blood pressure. One drawback, however, is that the extra sugar in the urine makes the urinary tract and genitals more hospitable to micro-organisms, leading to an increase in infections. What seemed to concern the F.D.A. reviewers more than these infections was a possible increased risk of breast and bladder cancers. Nine women, or 0.4 percent of those who took the drug, got breast cancer compared with one woman, or 0.09 percent, of those in the control group, according to AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers. For bladder cancer, the rate was nine cases, or 0.3 percent, for those taking the drug compared with one case, or 0.05 percent, for those in the control group. The companies argue that when all types of cancer, not just breast and bladder cancer, are considered, there is no increased risk for those taking dapagliflozin. They also say that some of the cancers were diagnosed so soon after the start of the trial that they were unlikely to be linked to the drug. “Based on a thorough nonclinical and clinical assessment, the data do not suggest that dapagliflozin is associated with a risk for either of these cancers,” the companies wrote in their own briefing document, adding, however, that data was limited.New diabetes drugs are being developed that reduce blood sugar in a straightforward way — by causing it to be excreted in the urine.

The announcement sent their stocks soaring on Thursday. The news appeared to brighten the prospects for millions of people with a heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation, doctors and analysts said. Many have been taking a drug called warfarin or not treating their dangerous conditions at all for fear of excess bleeding. “This is great news for patients and doctors,” said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, a leading cardiologist who was not involved in the research. “It shows the new class of anticoagulants works better than the only thing we’ve had available for 50 years.” Dr. Cannon, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School whose hospital research group performs trials for other drug companies, said he was thinking of switching both his parents to the new drug from warfarin. The results, however, are tentative. The drug, known as apixaban, or the brand name Eliquis, has not yet been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval, nor have the full study results been released. The companies said they planned to release the study on Aug. 28 at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Paris and file for approval in the United States and Europe later in the year. Eliquis was approved in Europe last month to prevent clots in patients receiving hip or knee replacement surgery. C. Anthony Butler, a pharmaceuticals analyst for Barclays Capital, said Eliquis had vaulted to the front of a potential $8.5 billion market in treating atrial fibrillation. “I don’t know how doctors can say they’re not going to use this,” Mr. Butler said, noting that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, both based in new York, are “marketing powerhouses.” The pill has two major competitors emerging in the market to prevent strokes and clots. Pradaxa, from Boehringer Ingelheim, was approved by the F.D.A. last year, and Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, is under F.D.A. review. Eliquis, according to the companies’ statement, holds a significant safety advantage. “I feel very excited about it, but you know, we have to see all the data,” said Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of the heart center at Mount Sinai Medical Center and former president of the American Heart Association. Dr. Fuster is heading an expert group next week that is expected to call for studies comparing the latest anticlotting medicines head-to-head against each other. Catherine J. Arnold, pharmaceuticals analyst for Credit Suisse, wrote investors a note Thursday predicting that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer would sell more than $3 billion a year of the drug. Doctors have clamored for an anticlotting drug with less risk of bleeding, Ms. Arnold wrote. The companies released enough information to prove their research was truly a milestone, she said. The newer drugs are all expected to be much more expensive than warfarin, which costs pennies a day. Pradaxa costs about $6 a day. Bayer’s stock plummeted 6.3 percent on the news in European trading, a loss of nearly $3 billion in market value, its biggest decline in two years. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 0.6 percent to $65.67. Boehringer Ingelheim is a private company. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb soared 5.7 percent to $29.33 on Thursday whiled Pfizer rose 1.8 percent, to $20.65. Bristol discovered the drug and Pfizer joined in a development deal in 2007. The companies’ study of Eliquis against warfarin included 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one other risk factor for stroke. It not only met the primary end-point of “noninferiority” in preventing strokes — a necessity for F.D.A. approval — but also showed it was actually superior in preventing strokes and avoiding major bleeding, the companies said. Warfarin has been the warhorse drug for anticlotting purposes for decades. But warfarin is inconvenient because it requires frequent monitoring to assure patients are not taking too much, which elevates bleeding risk, or too little, increasing the risk of a devastating stroke. Some foods and other drugs have a pronounced effect on warfarin levels, but not on the new drugs.A proposed new anticlotting drug for people with irregular heartbeats has been shown to prevent more strokes with less bleeding risk than the existing treatment, the drug makers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer said late Wednesday.

Schuchter, a melanoma specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, told reporters Sunday in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, where the results were presented. The drugs do not cure melanoma, except perhaps in rare cases. But experts said they might add two to several months to the expected lifespans of people with advanced melanoma. Right now people with metastatic melanoma — meaning it has spread to distant organs — typically live 6 to 10 months. In one trial, 84 percent of patients taking the experimental drug vemurafenib (pronounced vem-yoo-RAF-en-ib) were still alive after six months, compared with 64 percent of those getting an older chemotherapy drug, dacarbazine. Using another statistical measure, the risk of dying was reduced 63 percent. The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. Because of that, researchers do not yet know the median survival. “You don’t need to wait for 50 percent of 675 patients to die to conclude that one drug is much better than the other,” said Dr. Antoni Ribas of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was an investigator in the trial and has been a consultant to the developer of the drug. The other new drug, ipilimumab (pronounced ip-ee-LIM-yoo-mab), when combined with dacarbazine, extended median survival to 11.2 months compared with 9.1 months for those who received dacarbazine alone. After three years, 20.8 percent of those who got that new drug were alive, compared with 12.2 percent of those in the control group. The results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. Experts say more needs to be done, especially since melanoma affects more young adults than many other types of cancer. Even if the new drugs allow patients with metastatic melanoma to live two years, “Two years is nothing when you’re 30,” said Dr. Anna C. Pavlick, head of the melanoma program at New York University. Still, doctors and patient groups welcomed the progress because until now treatment of melanoma that had spread beyond the skin to distant organs “was terrible even by routine cancer standards,” said Dr. Vernon K. Sondak, chairman of cutaneous oncology at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. Also, the number of melanoma cases has been rising, unlike for many other types of cancer. Doctors say that is because of unprotected sun exposure years ago, the proliferation of tanning salons and perhaps more attention to detecting the disease. There were about 68,000 new cases of melanoma and about 8,700 deaths last year in the United States, up from 48,000 cases and 7,700 deaths in 2000, according to the American Cancer Society. Particularly fast increases have occurred among people older than 65 and among women 15 to 39 years old. Vemurafenib is the latest so-called targeted therapy, which inhibits the effects of genetic mutations that spur tumor growth and spread. In particular, the drug counters the effect of a mutation in a gene called B-RAF that was discovered in 2002 to be common in melanomas. (The drug’s name comes from V600E mutation in RAF.) The drug, which is taken orally twice a day, would be used only by the roughly half of melanoma patients whose tumors have this mutation. The drug significantly shrinks tumors in about half of these patients — or about a quarter of all melanoma patients. It was developed by Roche and Plexxikon, a biotechnology company in Berkeley, Calif., that was recently acquired by Daiichi Sankyo of Japan. The drug is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration within a few months. Ipilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body’s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor. Developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, it was approved in March and is sold under the name Yervoy. A series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries. The effect, however, typically lasts only about seven months before the cancer starts to grow again, though some patients benefit for more than two years. S. Taylor Chance, a 67-year-old real estate agent in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., has been taking vemurafenib in a clinical trial since March 2010. “If it weren’t for the trial I wouldn’t be here,” she said. It has not been all good. Ms. Chance said the drug caused such extreme pain at one point that “I called in the children and said, ‘I’m done, I can’t do this any more.’ ” But she had her dose reduced and took other medications for the pain. In the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. Many patients get minor skin cancers that can be removed by dermatologists. The trial of ipilimumab, paid for by Bristol-Myers, involved 502 patients with late-stage melanoma. Last year at this conference, researchers presented results of a trial showing a survival advantage for patients who had undergone a previous treatment. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time. While the extension of median survival of two months, from about 9 months to about 11 months, was less than some experts expected, researchers said the real benefit was that a small number of patients, perhaps 10 to 20 percent, could live a long time. Because it unleashes the immune system, ipilimumab can have serious side effects. In the latest trial, a big one was liver damage. A course of treatment of ipilimumab costs $120,000. The price of vemurafenib has not been announced, but is expected to be at least tens of thousands of dollars per year. Doctors are eager to try the two drugs together. Roche and Bristol-Myers said Thursday that they would conduct such tests.CHICAGO — Two new drugs have been found to prolong the lives of people with advanced melanoma, representing what researchers say is notable progress against the deadly skin cancer after decades of futility.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26drug.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Yervoy, a Melanoma Drug, Wins F.D.A. Approval<date>Published: March 25, 2011</date><text>The first drug shown to prolong the lives of people with the skin cancer melanoma won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday.The drug, Yervoy, was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is a novel type of cancer drug that works by unleashing the body’s own immune system to fight tumors. “This is really the first time in the melanoma field that there is a drug that extended survival in a meaningful way,” said Dr. Gerald P. Linette, an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, who participated in a clinical trial of the drug. In that randomized clinical trial, patients with metastatic melanoma treated with Yervoy lived a median of about 10 months, compared with 6.4 months for patients in a control group, who received a treatment believed to have had little effect. Bristol-Myers said it would charge $120,000 for a complete course of treatment, which consists of four infusions given over a three-month period. That price could spur continued debate about the cost of cancer drugs that prolong survival by only a few months on average. More than 20 percent of the people who received Yervoy in the trial lived at least two years, and some of them much longer. But there is no way at present to predict which patients will benefit from the drug. A spokesman for Bristol-Myers said some other drugs for melanoma cost nearly as much as Yervoy, without having demonstrated prolonged survival. He also said the company would offer financial support to certain patients. There were about 68,000 new cases of melanoma in the United States last year and 8,700 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. The number of cases has been rising, probably because of sun exposure without proper protection. Melanoma detected early as a mole on the skin can be surgically removed. But once it has metastasized, or spread, it is very difficult to treat, and various drugs have failed in clinical trials. The last drug approved was interleukin-2 in 1998, but it is so toxic it is rarely used. Neither it nor the other approved drug, dacarbazine, has clearly demonstrated improved survival. But another drug, being developed by Roche and Plexxikon, has also recently been found to prolong lives of patients with metastatic melanoma in a large clinical trial, according to those companies. They have not provided details of the results but said they hoped to apply later this year for its approval. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 86 cents to $27.29, in part because the price of the drug is higher than many analysts had expected and also because the approval allows for wider use of the drug than was predicted. The company’s trial tested the drug in patients who had already failed to benefit from treatment with another drug. But the F.D.A.’s approval also allows Yervoy to be used for previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. Bristol had announced on Monday that a new study showed Yervoy also improved survival when used for previously untreated patients. Robert Hazlett, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said annual sales could eventually exceed $1 billion. Bristol needs sales from new products to help offset the loss of patent protection next year on Plavix, its huge-selling anticlotting drug. Yervoy is an example of an emerging class of treatments known as immunotherapy that harness the body’s own immune system to fight tumors. Last year, the F.D.A. approved what was considered the first of these treatments, the prostate cancer drug Provenge, developed by Dendreon. Provenge is sometimes called a vaccine because it trains a patient’s immune system to attack the cancer. Yervoy, by contrast, works by essentially disabling a brake on the immune system. Because it is not specific for any type of tumor, it might conceivably be effective for many types, though this is yet to be proved in clinical trials. “The treatment is of the immune system, it’s not of the tumor,” said James P. Allison, head of the immunology program at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, whose work led to the development of the drug. The drawback is that loosening the restraints on the immune system can lead to dangerous side effects, the most worrisome being colitis and diarrhea, but also hepatitis, endocrine dysfunction and skin problems. The F.D.A. said that 12.9 percent of patients treated with Yervoy suffered severe or fatal autoimmune reactions. “It’s not your typical chemotherapy toxicity,” said Dr. Jeffrey A. Sosman, a professor at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. He said oncologists would have to be trained to recognize the side effects and treat them quickly with corticosteroids. The effect of Yervoy on cancer is also different from chemotherapy drugs, which can quickly kill some cancerous cells. With Yervoy, it can take weeks for the immune system to mount its attack. “Many people with really aggressive melanoma don’t have that time,” Dr. Sosman said. For most patients, tumors don’t shrink immediately and may even grow, making it hard to tell if the drug is working. When Donna Laurin of Glover, Vt., began taking the drug, melanoma spots on her right leg began proliferating wildly, making her worry. But after four doses, the spots began disappearing. “I have no sign of melanoma in my leg,” Ms. Laurin, 56, said. The effect so far has lasted seven weeks. Yervoy works by blocking a protein on the surface of T cells, the soldiers of the immune system, called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, or CTLA-4. The protein inhibits the action of the T cells. Bristol already sells a drug, Orencia, that essentially provides CTLA-4 to patients with rheumatoid arthritis in order to reduce their immune system’s attack on their joints. Yervoy works the opposite way, blocking CTLA-4 to unleash the immune system. Dr. Allison and colleagues, working at the University of California, Berkeley, in the mid-1990s, discovered the role of CTLA-4 and found that blocking it helped mice fight tumors. Drug companies were not that interested. “The idea was so new, it was hard to get somebody to take it,” Dr. Allison recalled in an interview this week. The university finally signed a deal in 1998 with NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, which in turn sublicensed rights to Medarex, another biotechnology company. Medarex developed a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein, to block CTLA-4 and began testing it in partnership with Bristol-Myers. Bristol-Myers then acquired Medarex for $2.4 billion in 2009. NeXstar, meanwhile, was acquired in 1999 by Gilead Sciences, which gave up its rights to royalties on Yervoy for a payment of $8.5 million from Medarex. The financially troubled Berkeley will receive royalties, however. The amount is being kept confidential. “I feel great because it’s been a long haul,” said Dr. Allison, who plays blues harp in an amateur band he named the Checkpoints, after immune system checkpoints like CTLA-4.The first drug shown to prolong the lives of people with the skin cancer melanoma won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/business/27pharma.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Bristol-Myers and Biogen Exceed Earnings Expectations<date>Published: October 26, 2010</date><text>Bristol-Myers Squibb reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday, but its revenue was below forecast because of weak sales of its schizophrenia treatment and changes that were part of the health care overhaul.Most of its American rivals, including Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson, have beat profit forecasts in the quarter because of cost cuts and other factors but have also reported weaker-than-expected revenue. Separately, the biotechnology company Biogen Idec also posted better-than-expected earnings, helped by higher sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex, but sales of another multiple sclerosis drug, Tysabri, were lower than expected. Bristol-Myers said third-quarter earnings from continuing operations rose 6.4 percent to $949 million, or 55 cents a share, from $892 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the drug maker earned 59 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 53 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Bristol-Myers shares fell 30 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $26.86. Global sales were little changed, at $4.8 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.92 billion. Sales of Abilify, which had been Bristol-Myers’s big growth driver in recent years, slumped in the quarter. Its sales fell 7 percent to $608 million, about $31 million below forecasts. Health care reform in the United States — including higher price rebates drug makers must extend to the government’s Medicaid insurance program for the poor — hurt Abilify revenue. Bristol-Myers also now keeps a lower percentage of Abilify sales under a recently restructured agreement with its partner Otsuka Pharmaceutical. Bristol-Myers, which loses patent protection late next year on Plavix, a drug to prevent blood clots with annual sales of $6 billion, said approval of other promising drugs would help cushion the blow of cheaper generics. The company said it expected full-year earnings, excluding special items, of $2.10 to $2.20 a share. That the company’s previous forecast of profit growth of 13.5 percent to 19 percent. Biogen, meanwhile, is battling to defend its share of the market for multiple sclerosis drugs in the face of new competition. Novartis recently introduced the first oral M.S. treatment, Gilenya, which some industry experts said could take a substantial share of the market. But Biogen executives said on a conference call with analysts that the company had taken extensive measures to defend sales of Avonex, its flagship product, by adding to its sales force, improving communications with patients and improving its support services. Net income in the third quarter fell to $254 million from $278 million a year ago as the company invested in an experimental drug to treat Lou Gehrig’s disease. On a per-share basis, net income rose to $1.05 from 95 cents because of a share buy-back program. Earnings excluding one-time items were $1.35 a share. On average, analysts had expected earnings of $1.22 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Biogen shares rose 9 cents, or 0.15 percent, to close at $59.99. Revenue rose 5 percent to $1.2 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.16 billion. Still, global sales of Tysabri, which Biogen markets with the Irish drug maker Elan Corporation, were weaker than expected. Sales of Tysabri rose 9 percent to $307 million. On average, analysts had expected Tysabri sales of $327 million. Biogen said that as of the end of September, about 55,100 patients were on Tysabri therapy worldwide. The weekly net addition of patients using the therapy fell to 177 in the third quarter from 185 in the second quarter.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/business/08drug.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Bristol-Myers to Buy ZymoGenetics for $885 Million<date>Published: September 7, 2010</date><text>Bristol-Myers Squibb said Tuesday it had agreed to acquire ZymoGenetics, the maker of a hepatitis C drug the companies were jointly developing, for $885 million.The offer of $9.75 a share in cash was an 84 percent premium to ZymoGenetics’s closing stock price on Tuesday, and the company’s shares jumped 85 percent, to $9.80, in after-hours trading. Bristol-Myers said the deal was likely to reduce its earnings by about 3 cents a share in 2010 and about 7 cents a share in 2011. The companies entered into a $1.1 billion agreement in January 2009 to co-develop and share profits for ZymoGenetics’s hepatitis C drug PEG-interferon lambda.

At least for Bristol-Myers Squibb.The company’s experimental anticoagulant drug apixaban worked better than aspirin in preventing stroke and systemic blood clots for patients who have an irregular heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation, according to new study data presented on Tuesday at a cardiology conference in Stockholm. Investment bank analysts have estimated that a new generation of stroke prevention drugs like apixaban, if approved by the Food and Drug Administration, could generate $10 billion or more in annual global sales. Patients taking apixaban had a rate of stroke or systemic blood clots of 1.6 percent a year, while those on aspirin had a rate of 3.6 percent a year, a statistically significant difference, according to a preliminary analysis of the new data. The rate of major bleeding was 1.2 percent a year for the apixaban group and 1.4 percent on aspirin — not a significant difference, researchers reported. Atrial fibrillation affects about 2.2 million people in the United States, and that number is expected to double in the next 10 years, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Bristol-Myers discovered apixaban and is developing the drug jointly with Pfizer. The study involved 5,600 patients who were unsuited for the standard treatment for atrial fibrillation, warfarin. In a note to investors on Tuesday, Christopher Schott, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote that positive responses to the study data among leading cardiologists “suggest that apixaban will likely capture a disproportionate share,” by some estimates up to 50 percent, of patients who cannot tolerate warfarin. The companies are also conducting a head-to-head trial of apixaban and warfarin in more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation. The companies expect to report data from that study next year, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb said. Indeed, apixaban is one of several drugs that pharmaceutical companies are developing in an effort to replace warfarin, a decades-old drug for atrial fibrillation. Prescription drugs like antibiotics, as well as foods rich in vitamin K, can affect the potency of warfarin. Also, patients on warfarin need regular blood tests to evaluate their clotting rate. Other warfarin alternatives in the pharmaceutical pipeline include rivaroxaban, discovered by Bayer HealthCare and under development jointly with Johnson &amp; Johnson, and dabigatran from Boehringer Ingelheim. A new study presented Tuesday at the cardiology conference in Stockholm said rivaroxaban worked about as well as standard treatments at preventing recurrent blood clots in the veins for people with deep vein thrombosis. The rate of risky blood clots in the veins or lungs was 2.1 percent for the rivaroxaban group compared with 3 percent for the standard treatment group, according to a statement Tuesday from Johnson &amp; Johnson. A side effect, bleeding, occurred in about 8 percent of patients in each group, the release said. Johnson &amp; Johnson has submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration for rivaroxaban as a treatment to reduce the risk of dangerous blood clots in people undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban is already marketed for that purpose in 75 countries outside of the United States, including Canada. Meanwhile, Boehringer Ingelheim, the German drug maker, has developed dabigatran, a drug to prevent stroke and systemic blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation. The drug is already approved for use in Canada. An F.D.A. panel is to review the drug on Sept. 20. Trading in Bristol-Myers closed at $26.08 a share on Tuesday, up 23 cents.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Drug Trials Test Bold Plan to Slow Alzheimer’s<date>Published: July 16, 2010</date><text>Marilyn Maldonado is not quite sure why she is at the Memory Enhancement Center in the seaside town of Oakhurst, N.J.“What are we waiting for?” she asks. About 10 minutes later, she asks again. Then she asks again. She is waiting to enter a new type of Alzheimer’s drug study that will, in the boldest effort yet, test the leading hypothesis about how to slow or stop this terrifying brain disease. The disease is defined by freckles of barnacle-like piles of a protein fragment, amyloid beta, in the brain. So, the current thinking goes, if you block amyloid formation or get rid of amyloid accumulations — plaque — and if you start treatment before the disease is well under way, you might have a chance to alter its course. On Tuesday, that plan got a new push. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association proposed new guidelines for diagnosis to find signs of Alzheimer’s in people who do not yet have severe symptoms, or even any symptoms at all. The guidelines are needed for the new approach to Alzheimer’s drug development. Just about every pharmaceutical company and many biotechnology companies have experimental drugs to block amyloid — there are more than 100 in the pipeline. And the companies would like to show that if they give their drugs early, they can slow or stop the disease. That is the ultimate goal for the drug in the study Mrs. Maldonado wants to enter, sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company is, for the first time, testing such a drug in patients who, on evaluation with memory tests and new brain scans and tests for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to be in a very early stage of Alzheimer’s. The idea is to attack the disease when there may still be time to stop the worst brain cell death. But there is a problem. The Food and Drug Administration says it needs to know not just that plaque was reduced or even that it disappeared, but that those who took a drug ended up with better memory and better ability to think and reason as compared with those who did not take the drug. Alzheimer’s, though, progresses so slowly that showing that a drug, started early, affects symptoms can take far longer than companies can afford to wait. There is reason not to accept other forms of proof, like scans or cerebrospinal fluid that show changes in amyloid in the brain, the F.D.A. says. The agency has approved drugs for diseases, including sudden death from heart arrhythmias, on the basis of tests that showed symptoms, like heart rhythms, improved. Then it turned out the drugs did not affect the course of the disease and, in the case of the heart drugs, actually hastened death. So the Alzheimer’s field is poised at an agonizing point — ready to move forward with new methods of diagnosis and drugs that might modify the course of the disease, but without proof that blocking amyloid actually makes a difference. In the meantime. Bristol-Myers is trying a two-pronged strategy to gain faster approval. It is starting treatment early, but not so early that patients are a decade or more away from Alzheimer’s. And as it looks for effects on symptoms like memory and reasoning, the company will be tracking what happens to amyloid in the brain, hoping to show symptoms improve or no longer worsen as plaque formation slows or stops. It is a gamble for the company, because even people with fairly mild symptoms may have too much brain damage to be helped. But it is a strategy that makes sense, said Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe, a Harvard researcher who is not affiliated with the study. “In my view, the sweet spot for amyloid-lowering trials is mild Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Selkoe said. “As soon as one of those trials shows benefit, everyone will move to prevention trials,” he said. “They will begin treating before there are symptoms.” Mrs. Maldonado may be one of the pioneers. The Amyloid Hypothesis Considering how important a medical problem Alzheimer’s is — afflicting 5.3 million Americans, the seventh-leading cause of death, and devastating and bankrupting families — it took a surprisingly long time to be recognized as a disease at all. And it took longer still to reach any kind of agreement on its cause. 1 2 3 Next Page »Marilyn Maldonado is not quite sure why she is at the Memory Enhancement Center in the seaside town of Oakhurst, N.J.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E0DA1F3DF936A25755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">THE GENOME AT 10; Awaiting the Genome Payoff<date>Published: June 15, 2010</date><text>NORTH WALES, Pa. -- At Merck's ''automated biotechnology facility'' here, robot arms adapted from automobile factories deftly shuttle plates containing human cells. Assisted by the robots and other complex machinery, scientists are studying what happens to the cells as each of the roughly 22,000 human genes is turned off. They hope to find the genes involved in different diseases, the starting point for creating a drug. It is a merger of sophisticated biology and brute force made possible only because the Human Genome Project provided the identity of all the human genes. But as with so much else that has spun off from the genome project, it is also an expensive gamble, with success far from assured. ''Can I point to a single drug right now that this has facilitated?'' said Michele Cleary, Merck's senior director for automated biotechnology. ''No, because we are in the early stages of this. There's information feeding into the early stages of the pipeline that we'll see the fruits of in years to come.'' Ten years after President Bill Clinton announced completion of the first draft of the Human Genome Project, in June 2000, its application to drug development is still, at best, a work in progress. But while many genetics scientists outside the drug industry say the project has had few medical benefits, industry researchers urge a wait-and-see patience. In fact, some of the first drugs based on genomic studies are now starting to reach the market. Several new ''targeted'' cancer drugs, for instance, block the effects of genetic abnormalities that spur tumor growth. A drug from the biotech giant Amgen, an osteoporosis treatment called Prolia, was approved two weeks ago. The company got its initial clue for the drug by making different genes in mice overactive. Mice with one particular overactive gene had unusually thick bones. And the drug company Human Genome Sciences, founded in 1992 as the genome project was just getting under way, applied last week for approval of Benlysta, which could be the first new drug in decades for treating lupus. That is nothing like the cornucopia of new drugs that some experts predicted the genome project would yield. A decade ago, drug companies spent billions of dollars equipping themselves to harness the newly revealed secrets of human biology. Investors bid the stocks of tiny genomics companies to stratospheric heights. That ''genome bubble'' has long since popped. And not only has there been no pharmacopeia, but some experts say the Human Genome Project might have at least temporarily bogged down the drug industry with information overload. As the head of Novartis's pharmaceutical business lamented in 2000, ''Data, data everywhere, and not a drug, I think.'' Indeed, even though research and development spending by major pharmaceutical companies has roughly doubled in the decade since the genome project was largely completed, reaching $46 billion last year, the number of new drugs approved each year has stayed about the same. There were 25 in 2009. Genomics is not the only reason for the decline in the bang from the research buck. A big factor has been stiffer testing requirements by the Food and Drug Administration. For all that, drug industry executives say it is simply a matter of time before the Human Genome Project pays off. They note that because it can take 15 years or more to go from a basic discovery to a marketed drug, it is too early to expect many drug approvals yet. Moreover, pharmaceutical executives say that even if there are not many drugs yet, the genome project has transformed the way research is done. ''It's become a very standard part of what we do,'' said Peter S. Kim, the executive vice president in charge of research at Merck. The company spent $1.1 billion in 2006 to acquire Sirna Therapeutics, which is developing the RNA interference technology that Merck uses to turn off genes. Dr. Kim said that having the genome sequence gave scientists ''the ability to do science at a different level.'' At Bristol-Myers Squibb, two-thirds of the drugs being developed have been ''touched'' in some way by genomics, said Elliott Sigal, president of research and development.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/03bristol.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Bristol-Myers Squibb Promotes President to Chief Executive<date>Published: March 2, 2010</date><text>TRENTON (AP) — The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb said on Tuesday that its chief executive would retire in May and be succeeded by the chief operating officer.The present chief executive, James M. Cornelius, 66, will remain as chairman at the request of the company’s board. He will be succeeded as chief executive by Lamberto Andreotti, 59. Mr. Andreotti was named president and chief operating officer in March 2009, and has been at Bristol-Myers for a dozen years, both overseas and in the United States. He previously worked for two other drug companies, KABI Pharmacia and then Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, which now is part of Pfizer. Mr. Cornelius will retire May 4, 2010. He became chief executive in April 2007, after serving on an interim basis about eight months. He was named chairman in February 2008. During his time at the helm of Bristol-Myers, Mr. Cornelius initiated a strategy called the String of Pearls to sell off noncore businesses like Mead Johnson nutrition franchise and buy multiple pearls — biotechnology companies or products in development — to transform the company into a biopharmaceutical powerhouse. The most prominent of those deals was last summer’s $2.1 billion purchase of the biotechnology company Medarex. It owns successful antibody technology used to create biologic drugs that make the immune system attack cancer cells — and it has several of its own drugs in development. Most of Bristol’s competitors have been focused on diversifying their product lines and slashing costs.

Go to the Prescriptions Blog » Times Topics: Health Care Reform Multimedia Profit Disparity Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Go to your Portfolio » After all, in return for the prospect of tens of millions of newly insured customers and a large degree of regulatory certainty, the pharmaceutical industry had agreed to pay a relatively small price: $8 billion a year in discounts and fees. It was a modest compromise for an industry with $246 billion in prescription drug sales last year. But now, with the health care overhaul on a back burner in Washington and possibly dead for this year, drug makers are getting a sinking sense of how a piecemeal public policy future might look for them. President Obama’s proposed budget this week, for example, includes a plan he alluded to in last week’s State of the Union address: a new tax on profits from some patents and other intangible assets parked in overseas tax havens by American companies. For drug makers, which are among those most likely to be affected by such a tax, the president’s proposal “pretty much came out of the blue,” said Martin A. Sullivan, an economist formerly with the Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation. Another expert agreed. “Pharma’s one that would really get hit,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “That’s a biggie.” The industry giant Pfizer, for example, which has said that 88 percent of its $56 billion in income from 2004 through 2008 originated overseas, could be subject to the corporate 35 percent tax rate on at least some of its foreign profit in the future if the president’s proposal goes through. Although the tax idea faced a cool reception from Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, it highlighted the risks to the drug industry of unpredictable election-year politics. It is a time when bolt-from-the-blue challenges may await drug makers, compared with the carefully mapped future they had worked out with the White House and the Senate under the health care legislation. As if to reinforce the continuing business challenges that drug makers face, regardless of carrots and sticks from Washington, Pfizer issued an earnings report and financial forecast this week that disappointed Wall Street. The report, on Wednesday, has helped send its shares down 6.3 percent in the last two days. Pfizer lowered its 2010 and 2012 forecasts, citing the rising dollar and the sale or spinoff of some assets, including animal health products and an H.I.V. drug. The company also noted the coming patent expirations on some of its blockbuster drugs, including Lipitor, as well as growing competition from lower-priced generics. Several of the other big American drug companies reported a mixed bag of results last week. Johnson &amp; Johnson posted a rare yearly decline in sales and gave a disappointing 2010 profit forecast. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates, helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Eli Lilly profit fell just short of expectations, and its shares declined as investors also showed concern about expirations of its drug patents. The other big American drug maker, Merck, plans to report on Feb. 16. None of those drug makers had forecast effects from a health care overhaul by Washington. But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill. Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown’s victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was “largely consistent with the principles” that were important to his industry. The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage. And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal  including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada  would be tabled in return for drug makers’ support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table. As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort. It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama’s offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America’s Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals. The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States. Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years. “Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,” he said. “There’s a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.” Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers. Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president’s new plan to tax “excessive” offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy. “The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,” Professor Gordon said. “They’re not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts. It’s not working to their advantage.” Some analysts, meanwhile, say parts of the $80 billion, 10-year deal could come back to bite the drug industry  if it is held to some of the cost pledges without receiving the offsetting political protection. The pact, for instance, committed the industry to support an increase in the rebate the government receives on Medicaid drugs  to 23 percent, up from 15 percent currently. In the current deficit-cutting environment, that discount may still look attractive to lawmakers. And it could conceivably be enacted by Congress at any time without being part of an industry quid pro quo. “No question that’s alive,” said Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical industry analyst for the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. But the overall health care reform package, he added, is “either dead or severely hobbled.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 5, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.With the possible demise of health care legislation, getting back to business as usual may not be the best thing for the nation’s drug makers.

Go to the Prescriptions Blog » Times Topics: Health Care Reform Multimedia Profit Disparity Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Go to your Portfolio » After all, in return for the prospect of tens of millions of newly insured customers and a large degree of regulatory certainty, the pharmaceutical industry had agreed to pay a relatively small price: $8 billion a year in discounts and fees. It was a modest compromise for an industry with $246 billion in prescription drug sales last year. But now, with the health care overhaul on a back burner in Washington and possibly dead for this year, drug makers are getting a sinking sense of how a piecemeal public policy future might look for them. President Obama’s proposed budget this week, for example, includes a plan he alluded to in last week’s State of the Union address: a new tax on profits from some patents and other intangible assets parked in overseas tax havens by American companies. For drug makers, which are among those most likely to be affected by such a tax, the president’s proposal “pretty much came out of the blue,” said Martin A. Sullivan, an economist formerly with the Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation. Another expert agreed. “Pharma’s one that would really get hit,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “That’s a biggie.” The industry giant Pfizer, for example, which has said that 88 percent of its $56 billion in income from 2004 through 2008 originated overseas, could be subject to the corporate 35 percent tax rate on at least some of its foreign profit in the future if the president’s proposal goes through. Although the tax idea faced a cool reception from Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, it highlighted the risks to the drug industry of unpredictable election-year politics. It is a time when bolt-from-the-blue challenges may await drug makers, compared with the carefully mapped future they had worked out with the White House and the Senate under the health care legislation. As if to reinforce the continuing business challenges that drug makers face, regardless of carrots and sticks from Washington, Pfizer issued an earnings report and financial forecast this week that disappointed Wall Street. The report, on Wednesday, has helped send its shares down 6.3 percent in the last two days. Pfizer lowered its 2010 and 2012 forecasts, citing the rising dollar and the sale or spinoff of some assets, including animal health products and an H.I.V. drug. The company also noted the coming patent expirations on some of its blockbuster drugs, including Lipitor, as well as growing competition from lower-priced generics. Several of the other big American drug companies reported a mixed bag of results last week. Johnson &amp; Johnson posted a rare yearly decline in sales and gave a disappointing 2010 profit forecast. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates, helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Eli Lilly profit fell just short of expectations, and its shares declined as investors also showed concern about expirations of its drug patents. The other big American drug maker, Merck, plans to report on Feb. 16. None of those drug makers had forecast effects from a health care overhaul by Washington. But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill. Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown’s victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was “largely consistent with the principles” that were important to his industry. The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage. And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal  including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada  would be tabled in return for drug makers’ support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table. As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort. It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama’s offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America’s Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals. The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States. Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years. “Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,” he said. “There’s a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.” Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers. Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president’s new plan to tax “excessive” offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy. “The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,” Professor Gordon said. “They’re not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts.

But the technicalities of Mead’s split from the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb mean it may make sense to delay any auction. Baby food is an attractive business. Two years ago, Nestlé paid 16 times estimated operating profits for Gerber, and Danone paid 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization  similar to operating profits  for the Dutch group Numico. More traditional food companies like Nestlé and Kraft, by comparison, are currently valued at no more than about 10 times Ebitda. In this light, the publicly traded Mead looks attractive. Its formula business is growing well. And the firm’s strong position in fast-developing South American markets makes it doubly desirable. The price doesn’t appear astronomical, either. With an enterprise value of $10 billion, Mead is worth 12 times estimated Ebitda, 40 percent less than the multiple at which Numico was sold. Bristol is currently selling its 83 percent stake in Mead to its shareholders through a tax-free exchange offer. Bristol was rumored to have considered selling Mead to a trade buyer, but apparently couldn’t reach a desirable price for tax reasons. With that issue addressed by the split-off, a bidder could re-emerge. There’s one catch. The deal could retroactively lose its tax-free status if a party that previously held talks with Bristol tried acquiring Mead within six months or a year, depending on when the discussions took place. So if Danone, for example, had talks with Bristol about Mead, it would now be out of the running for at least six months. Multiple potential bidders for Mead could be crowding the penalty box. So Mead is moving to establish barriers against unwanted suitors by giving management wide discretion to issue preferred shares and limiting the ability of investors to call special meetings. This might be the rare occasion when such hurdles end up helping shareholders. These measures could delay a sale until all the potential participants are back on the field, allowing Mead’s shareholders to reap the best price. Value to Whom? Chocolate and petroleum have both been on the minds of merger arbitrageurs lately, but not photocopiers. There’s hot bid action surrounding the hostile offer by Kraft for the British confectioner Cadbury and for the London-listed Dragon Oil by a Dubai company. But the arbitrageurs can’t really do much with Canon’s accepted bid for the Dutch Océ, which makes copiers and printers. Canon has made a knock-out offer. Its 730 million euro ($1.1 billion) bid is worth 70 percent more than the price at which Océ’s shares traded last week. The directors, largest shareholders and managers are already on board. Canon’s president, Tsuneji Uchida, and Océ’s chief technology and operations officer, Anton Schaaf, shook hands on it this week. Expect no fireworks. At first glance, the Océ deal makes Kraft Foods and the Emirates National Oil Company look stingy. Kraft has offered a 26 percent premium while the Dubai state-owned company offered a modest 35 percent premium. Investors accounting for 5 percent of Dragon Oil’s stock have publicly rejected Emirates’ bid, while Cadbury’s chairman has called Kraft’s offer derisory. By the Canon standard, they are right to be dismissive. Océ’s shareholders and board might have accepted a little less. But the price may be a fair reflection of Océ’s value to Canon. The Japanese company needs to bulk up its printing operations, having missed out on earlier industry consolidation. And there is scope to improve performance at the loss-making Océ, which lacks scale. What’s more, the old Océ share price reflected the company’s struggles, not its potential. The bid comes in at a reasonable five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland research. And the high premium precludes a counterbid from rival Konica Minolta, which has a research joint venture with Océ. Kraft and Emirates National Oil are in a different position. The potential synergies are smaller, making it difficult for interlopers, like a possible joint Hershey-Ferrero bid for Cadbury, to pay up. Canon’s generous offer should help keep one of corporate Japan’s largest forays into Europe from turning hostile.

But the company would be giving away only a small part of the 84 percent gain in its Mead shares since their initial public offering in February.

JPMorgan-Cazenove JPMorgan Chase and Cazenove agree that the destination is better than the journey. JPMorgan is nearing a deal to buy out Cazenove, its British investment banking partner, from a 50-50 joint venture from five years ago. The roughly £1 billion ($1.7 billion) price  10 times JPMorgan’s initial £100 million investment  is far from cheap. Before JPMorgan signs, it needs to be clear it can expand the business while preserving the best aspects of the status quo. A looming tax increase in Britain is one reason that Cazenove’s 1,500 shareholders may be eager to sell. In addition, the firm’s bumper year in equity issuance also provides a strong incentive. Cazenove’s share of the joint venture generated earnings of about £48.5 million in 2008. Assume a 50 percent uplift this year and JPMorgan would be paying 13 times current-year earnings at the £998 million price  a rich multiple for an investment bank. The conventional way to make an expensive deal pay off is to rip out overlapping people and infrastructure. But this would not be a conventional deal. The joint venture has been a success in large part because Cazenove has been allowed to retain its independent culture. JPMorgan effectively outsourced its British investment banking business to the joint venture. The American bank will need to proceed carefully, as it has done throughout the history of the partnership. There may be temptation simply to move the best bankers over and shut down the existing Cazenove operation. But killing the Cazenove culture could cut more profit than cost. Equity trading clients might defect, mourning the loss of a broker seen as independent. Cazenove’s corporate broking business is another sensitive subject. It relies on companies trusting the firm to talk to their investors. If clients feel as if they are dealing with just another a bulge-bracket firm bent on cross-selling, the franchise will quickly erode. There are ways to integrate Cazenove at arm’s length. Rather than bring the equities business into the fold, it may be better to let it rent JPMorgan’s technology and expertise in areas like algorithmic trading. And Cazenove could retain a separate office. Whatever the answers, JPMorgan needs to think imaginatively. Perhaps the journey need not end just yet.

Add to Portfolio Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Go to your Portfolio » On Monday, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sentenced a former senior pharmaceutical executive to write a book. Earlier this year the executive, Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar, a former senior vice president at Bristol-Myers Squibb, had pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the federal government about the company’s efforts to resolve a patent dispute over the blood thinner Plavix. The judge sentenced Dr. Bodnar to two years of probation during which he is to write a book about his experience connected to the case. Dr. Bodnar must also pay a $5,000 fine. Elkan Abramowitz, Dr. Bodnar’s lawyer, said he had never before heard of a case in which a judge sentenced a defendant to write a book. But this is not the first time Judge Urbina has demanded written penance. In 1998, he sentenced a prominent Washington lobbyist to write and distribute a monograph to 2,000 lobbyists at the defendant’s own expense. The lobbyist, James H. Lake, pleaded guilty to making illegal corporate campaign contributions. Judge Urbina ordered him to pay a $150,000 fine and to write a monograph describing the criminal provisions of federal laws governing corporate campaign contributions. In the sentencing hearing on Monday, Judge Urbina said he would like to see Dr. Bodnar write a book about the Plavix case as a cautionary tale to other executives. The case concerned accusations that Bristol-Myers had made false statements to federal investigators about the company’s attempt to resolve a patent dispute with a Canadian maker of generic drugs, Apotex. The Justice Department contended that the company in 2006 made a secret deal, in which Apotex would hold off making a generic version of Plavix. In exchange, the Justice Department said, Bristol-Myers indicated that it would subsequently give Apotex an exclusivity period in which it could produce its Plavix generic without Bristol’s making a generic of its own. The government said that Bristol-Myers’s actions were anticompetitive and had the potential to restrict public access to lower-priced drugs. Plavix had sales of about $4.9 billion in the United States in 2008, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. The initial accusations of anticompetitive behavior ended with only minor charges. In 2007, in an agreement worked out with the antitrust division of the Justice Department, Bristol-Myers agreed to plead guilty to two violations of the Federal False Statements Accountability Act and to pay $1 million, the maximum fine. In a separate suit, the Justice Department charged that Dr. Bodnar, who had negotiated with Apotex, misled the government over the Plavix agreement. In April, Dr. Bodnar pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the federal government, a misdemeanor.

The professor was not only a full-time member of the Harvard Medical faculty, but a paid consultant to 10 drug companies, including five makers of cholesterol treatments. “I felt really violated,” Mr. Zerden, now a fourth-year student, recently recalled. “Here we have 160 open minds trying to learn the basics in a protected space, and the information he was giving wasn’t as pure as I think it should be.” Mr. Zerden’s minor stir four years ago has lately grown into a full-blown movement by more than 200 Harvard Medical School students and sympathetic faculty, intent on exposing and curtailing the industry influence in their classrooms and laboratories, as well as in Harvard’s 17 affiliated teaching hospitals and institutes. They say they are concerned that the same money that helped build the school’s world-class status may in fact be hurting its reputation and affecting its teaching. The students argue, for example, that Harvard should be embarrassed by the F grade it recently received from the American Medical Student Association, a national group that rates how well medical schools monitor and control drug industry money. Harvard Medical School’s peers received much higher grades, ranging from the A for the University of Pennsylvania, to B’s received by Stanford, Columbia and New York University, to the C for Yale. Harvard has fallen behind, some faculty and administrators say, because its teaching hospitals are not owned by the university, complicating reform; because the dean is fairly new and his predecessor was such an industry booster that he served on a pharmaceutical company board; and because a crackdown, simply put, could cost it money or faculty. Further, the potential embarrassments  a Senate investigation of several medical professors, the F grade, a new state law effective July 1 requiring Massachusetts doctors to disclose corporate gifts over $50  are only now adding to pressure for change. The dean, Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier, who says he wants Harvard to catch up with the best practices at other leading medical schools, recently announced a 19-member committee to re-examine his school’s conflict-of-interest policies. The group, which includes three students, is to meet in private on Thursday. Advising the group will be Dr. David Korn, a former dean of the Stanford Medical School who started work at Harvard about four months ago as vice provost for research. Last year he helped the Association of American Medical Colleges draft a model conflict-of-interest policy for medical schools. The Harvard students have already secured a requirement that all professors and lecturers disclose their industry ties in class  a blanket policy that has been adopted by no other leading medical school. (One Harvard professor’s disclosure in class listed 47 company affiliations.) “Harvard needs to live up to its name,” said Kirsten Austad, 24, a first-year Harvard Medical student who is one of the movement’s leaders. “We are really being indoctrinated into a field of medicine that is becoming more and more commercialized.” David Tian, 24, a first-year Harvard Medical student, said: “Before coming here, I had no idea how much influence companies had on medical education. And it’s something that’s purposely meant to be under the table, providing information under the guise of education when that information is also presented for marketing purposes.” The students say they worry that pharmaceutical industry scandals in recent years  including some criminal convictions, billions of dollars in fines, proof of bias in research and publishing and false marketing claims  have cast a bad light on the medical profession. And they criticize Harvard as being less vigilant than other leading medical schools in monitoring potential financial conflicts by faculty members. Dr. Flier says that the Harvard Medical faculty may lead the nation in receiving money from industry, as well as government and charities, and he does not want to tighten the spigot. “One entirely appropriate source, if done properly, is industrial funds,” Dr. Flier said in an interview. And school officials see corporate support for their faculty as all the more crucial, as the university endowment has lost 22 percent of its value since last July and the recession has caused philanthropic contributors to retrench. The school said it was unable to provide annual measures of the money flow to its faculty, beyond the $8.6 million that pharmaceutical companies contributed last year for basic science research and the $3 million for continuing education classes on campus. Most of the money goes to professors at the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals, and the dean’s office does not keep track of the total. But no one disputes that many individual Harvard Medical faculty members receive tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year through industry consulting and speaking fees. Under the school’s disclosure rules, about 1,600 of 8,900 professors and lecturers have reported to the dean that they or a family member had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching, research or clinical care. The reports show 149 with financial ties to Pfizer and 130 with Merck. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 3, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.BOSTON  In a first-year pharmacology class at Harvard Medical School, Matt Zerden grew wary as the professor promoted the benefits of cholesterol drugs and seemed to belittle a student who asked about side effects.

Icahn and whose stock was involved in the insider trading scandal that sent Martha Stewart to jail. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: ImClone Systems Inc. Add to Portfolio ImClone Systems Incorporated Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Go to your Portfolio » The deal by Lilly, worth $70 a share, beat out an offer of $62 a share from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which markets ImClone’s cancer drug Erbitux in the United States along with ImClone. There is a consolation prize for Bristol-Myers. The $70-a-share offer means Bristol-Myers would get about $1 billion in cash for its nearly 17 percent stake in ImClone. Lilly’s per-share price is 51 percent above the closing price of ImClone on July 30, the day before Bristol-Myers made its first offer. Bristol-Myers said Monday that it would not make a counter-offer but instead looked forward to working with Lilly. James M. Cornelius, Bristol-Myers’s chief executive and a former Lilly executive, said it was in the best interest of Bristol-Myers shareholders to exercise discipline and not raise its bid. The acquisition would be the biggest ever for Lilly, which is based in Indianapolis, and represents an aggressive move into cancer drugs and biotechnology. The deal will make Lilly a “true oncology powerhouse,” John C. Lechleither, Lilly’s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call Monday morning. But Robert Hazlett, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said that while the deal made strategic sense for Lilly in the long run, “the price paid is expensive.” He predicted the deal would not add to Lilly’s earnings per share until 2013. Lilly’s stock was down nearly 8 percent, to $38.04, shortly after 1 p.m. ImClone’s shares were up nearly 3 percent to $66.80. Bristol-Myers was down nearly 4 percent, to $19.62. Besides Erbitux, which is ImClone’s only product on the market, ImClone has five other cancer drugs in clinical trials. Three of them could be in phase 3 studies, the final stage of testing, by next year,. That would mean the drugs could come to market early in the next decade to help Lilly cope with the loss of patent protection on some of its big drugs like Zyprexa for schizophrenia and Gemzar for cancer. Lilly executives said that if only one of ImClone’s experimental drugs made it to market, the deal would pay for itself. All of ImClone’s drugs are so-called biologics, meaning they are proteins made in living cells. Such drugs are not subject to the same onslaught of generic competition as the chemical pills traditionally made by pharmaceutical companies. That is one reason companies like Lilly are moving into biologics. Lilly said it would have to raise $2 billion to $3 billion in debt, which it contended would be no problem despite the credit crisis. The rest would come from cash. Lilly had $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Still, Mr. Hazlett, the analyst, said there were still some questions about whether the money could be raised. “Under ordinary circumstances they could certainly swallow this quite easily,” he said. “These aren’t ordinary circumstances.” The deal would mean the end of the independent existence of ImClone, a company that became infamous for a stock-trading scandal that sent the company’s founder and former chief executive, Samuel D. Waksal, and his friend Martha Stewart to prison. It would also represent a big payday for Mr. Icahn, who became involved as an investor in ImClone in the 1990’s because of his friendship with Mr. Waksal. In 2006 Mr. Icahn became chairman of ImClone and took effective control of the company ater a proxy fight. Mr. Icahn had said in a 2006 interview that he paid less than $20 a share for much of his stake in ImClone, although a regulatory filing that year indicated he might have paid about $33 for his stake of 11.7 million shares. In either case he stands to gain several hundred million dollars if shareholders approve the deal. “I would like to thank the stockholders who have been supportive of me and the new directors who replaced the old regime,” Mr. Icahn said in a statement Monday. Mr. Icahn had rejected Bristol-Myers’s initial bid of $60 a share and then labeled a subsequent $62 hostile offer “absurd.” He said the new deal vindicated his opposition to a takeover offer for $36 a share in 2006. People close to the situation say that bidder was Schering-Plough.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio ImClone Systems Incorporated Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Go to your Portfolio » Carl C. Icahn, the drug maker’s chairman, said in a statement that a “large pharmaceutical company” had made a $70-a-share offer for ImClone, the maker of Erbitux. The bid, which is contingent on due diligence, would trump a bid of $60 a share that Bristol-Myers made in July for the 83 percent of ImClone that it does not own. Wednesday’s announcement seems aimed at stoking a bidding war for ImClone, whose Erbitux cancer drug has performed well above industry analysts’ expectations. In its statement, ImClone said that its board had declared Bristol-Myers’s current offer inadequate. The company did not say whether it considered the $70 bid adequate. The new bid marks a continued comeback for ImClone, which was at the center of the Martha Stewart insider trading scandal a few years ago. Both Ms. Stewart and Samuel D. Waksal, ImClone’s former chief executive, served time in prison. Now Erbitux, ImClone’s sole current product, has proved successful, reaping nearly $1.4 billion in sales in 2007. The new bid also represents the growing interest by big drug makers for smaller rivals that focus on biotechnology. Only weeks before Bristol-Myers made public its bid for ImClone, Roche had offered to pay $43.7 billion for the 44 percent of Genentech, the biotech pioneer, that it did not already own. And in April, Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical agreed to buy Millennium Pharmaceuticals for $8.8 billion. Genentech has rejected Roche’s offer as too low. Biotechnology companies have become increasingly popular because their offerings, rooted in so-called biologic drugs that are grown in living cells, face little competition from generic products. Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Company, suggested that potential bidders for ImClone could include Merck of Germany, which owns the European marketing rights to Erbitux; Merck of New York, which is not related to Merck of Germany; Pfizer; and GlaxoSmithKline. A Bristol-Myers spokesman declined to comment on ImClone’s announcement. Shares of ImClone rose $4.29, or 6.7 percent, to $67.94. They have consistently traded above $60 a share since Bristol-Myers announced its bid at the end of July. Shares of Bristol-Myers fell 37 cents, to $21.67. In its statement, ImClone said that the new potential bid was not subject to financing, an important distinction at a time when the credit markets remain tighter than they were at the beginning of last year. Mr. Schmidt said that ImClone could eventually be sold for $70 to $75 a share. Yet any new bidder would face several hurdles in wresting ImClone away from Bristol-Myers. The companies jointly market Erbitux in the United States; as part of that agreement, struck in 2001, Bristol-Myers took a 17 percent stake in ImClone. ImClone said in August that it was considering breaking itself into two businesses: Erbitux, its current and sole product, and its pipeline of potential new drugs. That step could bring a significant increase in shareholder value, the company has said. Yet while ImClone claims that it owns the rights to a new and potentially improved version of Erbitux, currently under development, Bristol-Myers disputes that contention. “In our view, a bid in excess of $70 will likely emerge for ImClone before an acquisition is concluded,” analysts for Rodman &amp; Renshaw, an investment firm, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. “However, we would point out that Bristol has the upper hand in the negotiations.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 11, 2008, on page C3 of the New York edition.ImClone Systems on Wednesday threw a wrench into a $4.5 billion takeover effort by Bristol-Myers Squibb by saying it was entertaining a higher preliminary offer from a new unnamed suitor.

The offer by Bristol-Myers comes little more than a week after another drug giant, Roche, offered to buy the remaining 44 percent of its longtime biotechnology partner, Genentech, for $43.7 billion. And it comes during a period in which traditional pharmaceutical companies are buying smaller biotechnology players to replenish their pipelines. Recent deals include Takeda Pharmaceutical’s acquisition of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for $8.8 billion and GlaxoSmithKline’s purchase of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals for $720 million. Biotechnology companies like Genentech and ImClone sell so-called biologic products, which are made in living cells. Such drugs are particularly attractive to companies because they are not subject to generic competition. There is no process for approving generic copies of biologics. Bristol-Myers’s offer set off speculation on Wall Street that other big drug makers might seek to acquire biotechnology companies that are already their partners. Share of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, which developed a cancer drug with Bayer, closed up 10 percent at $40.50 on Thursday. Shares of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which co-developed a diabetes drug with Eli Lilly, climbed nearly 15 percent, closing at $31.55. ImClone said on Thursday that it was studying the offer by Bristol-Myers, which was delivered by letter to the chairman of ImClone, Carl C. Icahn. Bristol-Myers owns about 17 percent of ImClone in an alliance that began in 2001. The cash offer represents a premium of about 30 percent over ImClone’s closing share price on Wednesday. But investors apparently believe the sale price of ImClone could go even higher, bidding up the company’s shares by almost 38 percent, to $63.93 by Thursday’s close. Shares in Bristol-Myers were off nearly 2 percent, to $21.12. James M. Cornelius, Bristol-Myers’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was a natural partner for ImClone, and several analysts said the proposal was a smart move. Dr. Timothy Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst for Bernstein Research, had recently called the acquisition of ImClone a “likely maneuver” for Bristol-Myers and one that would make Bristol-Myers a more attractive takeover candidate. Mr. Cornelius, in an interview later on Thursday, said he was introduced to Mr. Icahn when Mr. Cornelius took the reins of Bristol-Myers nearly two years ago. Since then, the two have had what Mr. Cornelius described as “numerous discussions” focusing on the need to improve Erbitux sales in North America. He applauded Mr. Icahn for achieving that goal, but he would not talk specifically about whether the two had discussed a purchase of ImClone by Bristol-Myers. “I think we’ve talked about everything,” Mr. Cornelius said. “I think today is the culmination more of an evolutionary process where the company and Erbitux are doing much better.” Global sales of Erbitux in 2007 were nearly $1.4 billion. Bristol-Myers executives appeared to be cautious about discussing the potential acquisition, with Mr. Cornelius at one point referring to the company’s previous problems with both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. A little over a year ago, Bristol-Myers was released from a two-year government oversight arrangement after having run afoul of the Justice Department in an inventory manipulation scandal more than seven years ago. ImClone has drawn its share of regulatory attention as well. It was at the center of a trading scandal involving Martha Stewart and Samuel D. Waksal, ImClone’s former chief executive. Both served time in jail. In addition to full rights to Erbitux, Bristol-Myers would acquire a pipeline of five antibodies now under development. Antibodies are proteins that attack invading pathogens. One of the attractive experimental products is a new version of Erbitux. The drug is made partly with monkey cells. By removing those cells and replacing them with human cells, the product would potentially cause fewer side effects. Mr. Cornelius called that formulation a potential “newer and improved” version of Erbitux. Erbitux is approved for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and for use in the treatment of cancer of the head and neck. The company has also been hoping to get approval to sell it as a treatment for lung cancer. Last December, Bristol-Myers had said its strategy involved selling off some of its more traditional assets and becoming a “next generation biopharma” company. As part of that strategy, Bristol-Myers sold its ConvaTec wound care and ostomy business this year, freeing up $4.1 billion for acquisitions. That deal is expected to close within days.

The offer by Bristol-Myers comes little more than a week after another drug giant, Roche, offered to buy the remaining 44 percent of its longtime biotechnology partner, Genentech, for $43.7 billion. And it comes during a period in which traditional pharmaceutical companies are buying smaller biotechnology players to replenish their pipelines.

Investors also seemed worried about the fate of its potential blockbuster heart drug, prasugrel. At Bristol-Myers, James M.

The same drug generated discussion among analysts who cover Bristol-Myers, who say that approval of prasugrel could cut into sales of Bristol’s top seller, the blood thinner Plavix. Bristol-Myers executives, however, told the analysts that prasugrel was more of a niche drug, aimed at about 15 percent of the patients now treated by Plavix.

Skip to next paragraph Managing Globalization: Justice Isnt Globalized Yet As a result, the Supreme Court announced on Monday that a lower court’s judgment allowing the high-profile lawsuit against the companies to move forward was automatically affirmed. A quorum of six of the nine justices is necessary for the court to conduct business. While the recusal of four justices is unusual, so was the case that provoked it, a consolidation of 10 lawsuits filed in the name of everyone who lived in South Africa from 1948 to 1994 and who was injured by the official system of racial separation. The dozens of corporate defendants represented a who’s who of American business. The outcome calls attention to the occasionally uncomfortable consequences of the justices’ ownership of stock in individual companies. With solitary recusals being much more frequent, a 4-to-4 deadlock is a more common outcome than an inability to proceed with the case at all. That happened on March 3, when nonparticipation by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. resulted in a 4-to-4 tie in a case on the permissibility of damage suits against the makers of federally approved pharmaceuticals. According to his most recent financial disclosure form, the chief justice owns stock in Pfizer Inc., the corporate parent of the defendant in that case, Warner-Lambert Company v. Kent, No. 06-1498. It remains to be seen whether the absence of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. from the Exxon Valdez punitive damages case, argued on Feb. 27, will result in a tie vote. His ownership of Exxon Mobil stock led to his recusal from that case, Exxon Shipping Company v. Baker, No. 07-219. In a tie vote, the lower court’s decision is upheld but it has no effect as precedent in other cases. Federal law makes it mandatory for judges to remove themselves from cases if they own even a single share of stock in a company that is a party in a case. Judges, unlike some executive branch officials, are not required to divest themselves of their stock holdings. Nonetheless, Congress acted in 2006 to deal with the recusal problem by making divestiture more appealing. It extended to the federal judiciary the relief from capital gains tax liability that it had already granted to executive branch officials who sell individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds in government securities or approved mutual funds. Whether the apartheid case, which seeks $400 billion in damages from the corporate defendants, ever gets to trial remains highly uncertain, despite the Supreme Court’s inability to act on the companies’ request to dismiss it. The government of South Africa strongly opposes the litigation, and the Bush administration supported the companies’ appeal on the ground that the case “is causing present injury to important interests of the United States and the Republic of South Africa.” The Supreme Court’s order in the case, American Isuzu Motors, Inc. v. Ntsebeza, No. 07-919, listed Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito along with Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer as having taken “no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.” “Since a majority of the qualified justices are of the opinion that the case cannot be heard and determined at the next term of the court, the judgment is affirmed,” the order said. The outcome has the same effect as a tie vote  it makes no law and does not set any precedent. As is usual, the court did not give reasons for the justices’ recusals. Exxon Mobil is a defendant, as is another company in which Justice Alito owns stock, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Justice Breyer owns stock in several of the companies. Chief Justice Roberts owns the stock of another defendant, Hewlett-Packard. Justice Kennedy’s reason for recusal does not appear to be stock, but rather a son’s employment with another defendant, Credit Suisse, a situation that has previously led the justice to disqualify himself. The plaintiffs have invoked one of the oldest federal laws, the Alien Tort Statute, which was enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789. It is a jurisdictional statute that does not by itself convey any substantive rights. Rather, it authorizes the federal courts to decide “any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” The Alien Tort Statute, sometimes called the Alien Tort Claims Act, lay dormant for most of two centuries until it was rediscovered as a way to seek redress in United States courts for human rights violations committed overseas. The Supreme Court, while not foreclosing the use of the statute for that purpose, has been notably skeptical. A footnote in a 2004 Supreme Court decision on an unrelated Alien Tort Statute case referred specifically to the South African lawsuit, noting that there was “a strong argument that federal courts should give serious weight to the executive branch’s view of the case’s impact on foreign policy.” In its ruling last October allowing the case to proceed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, ordered the district court to consider defenses it had not previously addressed. These include whether the suit presents a “political question” that is beyond the institutional capacity of a federal court to resolve.

AstraZeneca, based in London, said its net income fell 3.7 percent, to $1.5 billion. Bristol-Myers’s earnings dropped 4.2 percent as costs offset soaring sales of its blood thinner Plavix. Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, said profit fell 73 percent, to 762 million euros ($1.21 billion), after asset sales. AstraZeneca said sales of the ulcer treatment Nexium fell in the United States and Western Europe, while Bristol-Myers won market share with the Plavix blood thinner after beating back generic competition. Amgen, the biotechnology company, said Thursday that its first-quarter profit climbed 2 percent as demand for the arthritis treatment Enbrel offset a decline in anemia drug sales. Net income rose to $1.14 billion, or $1.04 a share, from $1.11 billion, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales slipped to $3.61 billion from $3.69 billion. Worldwide sales of Aranesp, the anemia drug that was Amgen’s biggest product in 2007, led the decline. The product’s revenue fell to $761 million, a 25 percent decline from $1.02 billion a year earlier. Sales of another anemia drug, Epogen, fell 11 percent to $554 million, from $625 million a year earlier, because of declining use and lower doses. ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company based in New York, reported its third straight quarterly loss, of $55.9 million, or 65 cents a share. An Irish competitor, the Elan Corporation, said its first-quarter loss narrowed to $85.5 million, or 18 cents a share, as sales of the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri tripled. AstraZeneca reported $1.03 in earnings per share. The drug maker said its profit fell from $1.56 billion. Sales increased 10 percent, to $7.68 billion. Bristol-Myers said it would sell as much as 20 percent of its infant-formula unit, Mead Johnson Nutritionals. First-quarter net income fell to $661 million, or 33 cents a share, from $690 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. The results included $113 million in charges as the company cut jobs, shut plants and shed products to deliver $1.5 billion in annual savings before 2012. Sales climbed to $5.18 billion from $4.32 billion as the company recovered from temporary competition to Plavix from a generic drug maker last year. Plavix sales climbed 39 percent. Bayer’s first-quarter profit was 0.96 euro a share, compared with 2.81 billion euros, or 3.44 euros a share, a year earlier when Bayer had a one-time gain of almost 2.2 billion euros. Sales rose 2.4 percent, to 8.54 billion euros, Bayer said.

Skip to next paragraph Mel Evans/Associated Press The lawyer for Andrew G. Bodnar, a former Bristol-Myers senior vice president, said he would plead not guilty. The indictment, filed Wednesday in Washington, charged that Andrew G. Bodnar, a doctor, had made a false statement to the Federal Trade Commission in describing a 2006 agreement between Bristol-Myers and Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs. Dr. Bodnar had led negotiations to stop Apotex from selling its own version of Plavix, a blood thinner that is Bristol-Myers’s top-selling drug. Dr. Bodnar would not comment on Wednesday, but his lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said he would plead not guilty. “All I can say is that we will vigorously contest these charges; we think they are baseless,” Mr. Abramowitz said. Bristol-Myers pleaded guilty to charges in the case last June, and the company paid a $1 million fine. A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, Laura Hortas, said Wednesday that the company would not comment on Dr. Bodnar’s indictment. If convicted on the single charge, Dr. Bodnar, 60, could face penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The indictment stems from a federal investigation that led, in part, to the ouster of the previous Bristol-Myers chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, in September 2006. Earlier that year, Apotex was threatening to sell its own generic version of Plavix before expiration of a patent that gave Bristol-Myers and its partner, Sanofi-Aventis, exclusive rights to the brand-name drug until 2011. The threat by Apotex, which had filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of that patent, was viewed as a serious problem for Bristol-Myers. In 2005, Plavix generated about $3.5 billion in United States sales. Mr. Dolan dispatched Dr. Bodnar to Toronto to negotiate a settlement. During those meetings, in May 2006, the indictment charges, Dr. Bodnar made secret assurances to Apotex that Bristol-Myers would not issue its own generic version of the drug to compete with Apotex. At the time, Bristol was bound by a federal consent order requiring it to submit such agreements to the Federal Trade Commission for clearance. The F.T.C. would have been looking for any deals that restrained competition and led to higher prices. According to the indictment, Bristol-Myers never disclosed that part of the Apotex agreement to the F.T.C. And the indictment contends that after the investigation had begun, Dr. Bodnar certified to the F.T.C. that there had been no such secret deal. In a letter to employees at the time of its guilty plea last year, the company said it had never entered into a secret deal but was taking responsibility for the actions of a former senior executive. Although that was an apparent reference to Dr. Bodnar, the letter did not name him. After the negotiations with Apotex broke down, the Canadian company briefly distributed its generic drug in the summer of 2006, causing Plavix’s sales to plummet. A United States district judge, Sidney H. Stein, ordered Apotex to stop selling its drugs, but not until it had flooded the market with a six-month supply, depressing Bristol-Myers sales by more than $1 billion. Last June Judge Stein issued another order upholding the patent on Plavix. Apotex is appealing that ruling. Plavix sales recovered in 2007, when Bristol-Myers reported sales of $4.06 billion for the drug in the United States. More Articles in Business »A former senior vice president at Bristol-Myers Squibb has been indicted on federal charges of negotiating a secret pact between the company and a generic drug maker and then hiding the deal from federal regulators. Skip to next paragraph Mel Evans/Associated Press The lawyer for Andrew G. Bodnar, a former Bristol-Myers senior vice president, said he would plead not guilty. The indictment, filed Wednesday in Washington, charged that Andrew G. Bodnar, a doctor, had made a false statement to the Federal Trade Commission in describing a 2006 agreement between Bristol-Myers and Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs. Dr. Bodnar had led negotiations to stop Apotex from selling its own version of Plavix, a blood thinner that is Bristol-Myers’s top-selling drug. Dr. Bodnar would not comment on Wednesday, but his lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said he would plead not guilty. “All I can say is that we will vigorously contest these charges; we think they are baseless,” Mr. Abramowitz said. Bristol-Myers pleaded guilty to charges in the case last June, and the company paid a $1 million fine. A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, Laura Hortas, said Wednesday that the company would not comment on Dr. Bodnar’s indictment. If convicted on the single charge, Dr. Bodnar, 60, could face penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The indictment stems from a federal investigation that led, in part, to the ouster of the previous Bristol-Myers chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, in September 2006. Earlier that year, Apotex was threatening to sell its own generic version of Plavix before expiration of a patent that gave Bristol-Myers and its partner, Sanofi-Aventis, exclusive rights to the brand-name drug until 2011. The threat by Apotex, which had filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of that patent, was viewed as a serious problem for Bristol-Myers. In 2005, Plavix generated about $3.5 billion in United States sales. Mr. Dolan dispatched Dr. Bodnar to Toronto to negotiate a settlement.

Schiff, was to go on trial this week. But a judge’s ruling that pares back the federal case against Mr. Schiff has delayed his trial. It is a setback for Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, in a case involving so-called channel stuffing by Bristol-Myers. In a ruling dated March 19, Judge Faith S. Hochberg of Federal District Court in Newark came down on the side of Mr. Schiff, limiting the scope of what the prosecutors can argue against him and criticizing them for repeatedly changing their theory of the crime they say Mr. Schiff committed. “The court will permit no further ‘legal theory morphs’ in this case,” the judge said, noting that the charges against Mr. Schiff had been lingering for three years. One part of her order prevents the prosecution from linking Mr. Schiff’s activities to a plunge in the price of Bristol-Myers Squibb stock during 2002, after inventory problems were disclosed. The prosecutors had hoped to use that approach to tie Mr. Schiff’s actions to investor losses. Mr. Christie’s office said this week that it would appeal Judge Hochberg’s ruling, declining to comment further. The appeal will delay Mr. Schiff’s trial until after a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The case against the former president of Bristol-Myers’s worldwide medicines group, Richard J. Lane, is also in limbo as a result of the appeal. The government had agreed not to try Mr. Lane until after Mr. Schiff’s trial. A lawyer for Mr. Schiff, David M. Zornow of the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, said, “We are confident that the judge’s careful and well-reasoned opinion will be upheld on appeal.” Mr. Schiff and Mr. Lane were indicted in April 2005 in connection with allegations that Bristol-Myers Squibb had artificially inflated sales through channel stuffing, a process in which a company uses financial incentives to encourage wholesalers to buy excess inventory. The indictment contended that Mr. Lane and Mr. Schiff used the inflated sales to mislead investors about the financial results so that revenue lived up to analysts’ expectations, even though the revenue levels were unsustainable. Mr. Schiff, 60, and Mr. Lane, 57, who both pleaded not guilty, were the only corporate executives indicted. The same charges, however, led to a deferred prosecution agreement between Mr. Christie’s office and Bristol-Myers Squibb, effectively putting the company under probation for two years. Bristol-Myers, based in New York, also paid $300 million in fines and penalties. The original indictment contended that Mr. Schiff had imposed accounting procedures that underreported rebate liabilities to wholesalers, resulting in company sales and earnings that appeared stronger than they were by more than $500 million over two years. The latest delay in his case comes after a decision by prosecutors to simplify it by limiting the scope of the charges. In a series of changes, the prosecutors stripped out those and various other contentions that Mr. Schiff had manipulated books and violated accepted accounting principles. As of last week, the remaining charges included accusations that Mr. Schiff had made misstatements during conference calls with analysts and omitted disclosures from filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Judge Hochberg’s ruling, however, precludes prosecutors from discussing suspected omissions in S.E.C. reports, generally narrowing attacks against any actions Mr. Schiff may have taken to mislead investors. She said that the case would go forward on legal theories related to conspiracy, misstatements and omissions during analyst calls. Those would include, for example, a statement that Mr. Schiff made during a call on April 25, 2001, that there were “no unusual items” in wholesale inventories. Defense lawyers plan to call Adam Fein, an expert in pharmaceutical distribution channels who heads Pembroke Consulting in Philadelphia. He is expected to maintain that as a way to increase profit margins, it was not unusual for drug wholesalers to stockpile inventories when they thought manufacturers intended to raise prices.

Bristol-Myers also took a hefty $275 million charge for losses on investments in securities backed by subprime mortgages. Wyeth, which is based in Madison, N.J., said its revenue rose 10 percent, and higher costs for materials were more than offset by lower spending on sales, administration and research. The company, which makes Effexor, the world’s top-selling antidepressant, reported net income of $1.02 billion, or 75 cents a share, in the October-December quarter, up from $855.4 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding an after-tax charge of $48 million, or 3 cents a share, for the company’s three-year-old productivity initiative, net income would have been 78 cents a share. That just missed the 79-cent expectation of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, who typically exclude one-time items. But Wyeth said new generic competition for a key drug would keep total revenue flat this year, as it embarks on a sweeping reorganization. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is based in New York, said that fourth-quarter losses narrowed on better sales of a key drug, Plavix. The company said the charge for its losses on the subprime mortgage securities did not affect liquidity or financial flexibility, but that additional write-downs were possible if economic conditions worsen. “Obviously if the credit crisis continues to expand across the market, there may be risk to some of our corporate bonds,” said the company’s chief financial officer, Andrew Bonfield. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the New York-based company lost $89 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $134 million, or 7 cents a share, a year ago, when sales of Plavix, a blood thinner, plunged. Including earnings from its recently spun-off medical imaging business, earnings totaled 35 cents a share. Revenue rose 33 percent, to $5.38 billion, from $4.06 billion, as worldwide sales of Plavix nearly tripled to $1.37 billion. Worldwide pharmaceutical sales increased 39 percent, to $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter, helped by the weaker dollar. AstraZeneca, the British drug maker, said fourth-quarter profit fell 12.5 percent, to $1.27 billion, on restructuring and acquisition costs, as well as falling demand for Nexium and slowing sales growth of its Crestor cholesterol pill. Full-year profits fell 6.5 percent, to $7.98 billion. Still, AstraZeneca raised its outlook for 2008, forecasting core earnings of $4.40 to $4.70 a share, compared with $4.38 in 2007. AstraZeneca said it faced stiff competition in the United States for drugs like Nexium, which treats gastrointestinal problems. It bought MedImmune Inc., based in Gaithersburg, Md., in June for $15.6 billion to bolster its portfolio. Revenue rose 14 percent over the quarter, to $8.17 billion, and 7 percent over the year to $29.56 billion. Wyeth shares closed down 3 cents, at $39.67.

The former trader, David Pajcin, whose testimony led to the arrest of a half-dozen other individuals, including another former Goldman banker, was released Friday afternoon after serving about two years in prison. “Judge Marrero is a very thoughtful and thorough judge,” Jesse M. Siegel, Mr. Pajcin’s lawyer, said of Victor Marrero, the sentencing judge. “I was confident he would make the right decision, and he did.” Along with Eugene M. Plotkin, a former Goldman associate, Mr. Pajcin led one of the broadest insider-trading schemes in years. The ring spanned an ocean and involved a dozen people. Among those involved were a former Merrill Lynch analyst, two former printing plant workers and an exotic dancer. Their three-pronged plan relied on confidential information on future mergers, provided by the former Merrill analyst; information stolen from pre-publication copies of BusinessWeek magazine; and grand jury testimony from an investigation into Bristol-Myers Squibb. Federal investigators first got wind of the conspiracy when an account in the name of Mr. Pajcin’s aunt, a retired underwear seamstress in Croatia, registered a $2 million profit from trading in Reebok options. That activity had taken place just before the sneaker maker’s sale to Adidas Salomon. At his court hearing Friday, Mr. Pajcin apologized to the court, the federal government and his family. Mr. Pajcin’s sentence was about half that given earlier this month to Mr. Plotkin, the other lead defendant in the case. Mr. Plotkin was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison. “While I recognize that the government has to reward cooperating witnesses, I’m surprised that the lead defendant who initiated the conspiracy and did most of the activities received such a soft sentence,” Edward Little, a lawyer for Mr. Plotkin, said Friday.

Besides layoffs, the company said it would sell or close half its 27 manufacturing plants worldwide, farm out some manufacturing and winnow its portfolio of more than 500 products by about 60 percent. That will be accomplished both by selling mature products and eliminating product lines. Generic competition, a dearth of new drugs and a more safety-conscious posture by the Food and Drug Administration are among factors that have led to the announcements of at least 35,000 industry layoffs during the last year, industry analysts said. The chief executive of Bristol-Myers, James M. Cornelius, delivered the layoff news to investment analysts yesterday at a conference in Manhattan. He said that while it was difficult to cut employees, his company was late in doing so. “I’ve counted: since 2000, there have been 100,000 job eliminations in what we think of as big pharma,” Mr. Cornelius said during a break in the conference. “We’re about the only company that has had the same head count.” Mr. Cornelius took over on an interim basis in September 2006 after the company’s board sought the resignation of his predecessor, Peter R. Dolan. More recently, Mr. Cornelius agreed to remain as chief executive until May 2009. Of more than 43,000 people employed by Bristol-Myers, 1,300 were notified of their layoffs last week and an additional 3,500 will be let go in 2008. The cuts will be part of an overhaul that the company says will reduce annual expenses by $1.5 billion by 2010 and help it adjust to a business model that emphasizes specialty biotechnology products rather than big-market pharmaceuticals. The company declined to say exactly where the layoffs had occurred, other than an unspecified number at a biotechnology plant in East Syracuse, N.Y. Many of the 1,300 jobs already eliminated are in administrative positions like human resources, information technology and finance, the company said. Bristol-Myers had already announced that it would close manufacturing and packaging plants in Colón, Panama; Mayaguez, P.R.; and Barcelona, Spain. The company is facing the same problem as many other drug makers: the looming loss of patent protection for an important drug. In Bristol-Myers’s case, that is the blood-thinning agent Plavix. A generic equivalent will be available beginning in 2011, when the company hits what it is calling the generic cliff. Plavix generates about $3 billion in annual sales for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Industrywide, drugs with combined annual sales estimated at $60 billion will lose patent protection in the next five years. That reality is frequently cited for layoffs at drug companies, including Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, which has announced job cuts of about 10,000 in the past year, or about 10 percent of its work force. Johnson &amp; Johnson said this year that it would cut 4,800 position, or about 4 percent of its employees. Merck announced a global revamping in November 2005 that included an overall work force reduction of about 10 percent. There have already been 6,000 jobs cut, and the company is expected to lay off 1,000 more workers by the end of next year. James Kumpel, an analyst for the investment house Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, said that part of the problem facing drug makers was an increasingly cautious F.D.A. This year through October, the agency approved only 14 new molecular entities  drugs that are entirely new compounds rather than changes in formulations. That is a decline of about 18 percent from the comparable period in 2006, and it is well below recent norms, according to Mr. Kumpel’s analysis. Mr. Kumpel said the trend appeared to reflect the lowest rate of F.D.A. approvals since 1994. “If the F.D.A. is not allowing drugs to get to the market, or is just holding them to much tougher standards than before, drug makers face the prospect of a lot of new drugs going off patent and no new blockbusters to take their place,” Mr. Kumpel said. Despite the higher regulatory hurdle, Bristol-Myers appears poised to move away from its nonpharmaceutical health care businesses to focus even more narrowly on drugs. Mr. Cornelius, in a presentation, said Bristol-Myers would sell its medical imaging division, which is based in North Billerica, Mass. The unit employs about 800 people, 400 of them in North Billerica. The company might also sell its baby formula business, Mead Johnson Nutritionals, based in Evansville, Ind., and its ConvaTec products business, based in Skillman, N.J. ConvaTec specializes in products for wound care and ostomies  surgical openings in the abdomen to eliminate bodily wastes. Analysts have said Mead Johnson and ConvaTec together might bring in about $13 billion if sold. After its overhaul, Bristol-Myers, which has been based in Manhattan since the 1940s, is expected to maintain a mere toehold in the city. A spokesman said the company was expected to vacate all but one floor of its headquarters at 345 Park Avenue, where it occupied 550,000 square feet as recently as 10 years ago. Bristol-Myers has announced plans to streamline operations before. Its past efforts, however, have not been seen as having much effect on expenses. “Bristol has really been unable to cut costs on an absolute basis,” Jon LeCroy, a pharmaceutical analyst for Natixis Bleichroeder, said in a telephone interview. The company also announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend for the first time since 2002, to 31 cents a share from the current 28 cents. The stock, which has ranged from about $25 to $32 in the last year, closed yesterday at $29.26, up 20 cents.

Dolan. More recently, Mr. Cornelius agreed to remain as chief executive until May 2009. Of more than 43,000 people employed by Bristol-Myers, 1,300 were notified of their layoffs last week and an additional 3,500 will be let go in 2008. The cuts will be part of an overhaul that the company says will reduce annual expenses by $1.5 billion by 2010 and help it adjust to a business model that emphasizes specialty biotechnology products rather than big-market pharmaceuticals. The company declined to say exactly where the layoffs had occurred, other than an unspecified number at a biotechnology plant in East Syracuse, N.Y. Many of the 1,300 jobs already eliminated are in administrative positions like human resources, information technology and finance, the company said. Bristol-Myers had already announced that it would close manufacturing and packaging plants in Colón, Panama; Mayaguez, P.R.; and Barcelona, Spain. The company is facing the same problem as many other drug makers: the looming loss of patent protection for an important drug. In Bristol-Myers’s case, that is the blood-thinning agent Plavix. A generic equivalent will be available beginning in 2011, when the company hits what it is calling the generic cliff. Plavix generates about $3 billion in annual sales for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Industrywide, drugs with combined annual sales estimated at $60 billion will lose patent protection in the next five years. That reality is frequently cited for layoffs at drug companies, including Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, which has announced job cuts of about 10,000 in the past year, or about 10 percent of its work force. Johnson &amp; Johnson said this year that it would cut 4,800 position, or about 4 percent of its employees. Merck announced a global revamping in November 2005 that included an overall work force reduction of about 10 percent. There have already been 6,000 jobs cut, and the company is expected to lay off 1,000 more workers by the end of next year. James Kumpel, an analyst for the investment house Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, said that part of the problem facing drug makers was an increasingly cautious F.D.A. This year through October, the agency approved only 14 new molecular entities  drugs that are entirely new compounds rather than changes in formulations. That is a decline of about 18 percent from the comparable period in 2006, and it is well below recent norms, according to Mr. Kumpel’s analysis. Mr. Kumpel said the trend appeared to reflect the lowest rate of F.D.A. approvals since 1994. “If the F.D.A. is not allowing drugs to get to the market, or is just holding them to much tougher standards than before, drug makers face the prospect of a lot of new drugs going off patent and no new blockbusters to take their place,” Mr. Kumpel said. Despite the higher regulatory hurdle, Bristol-Myers appears poised to move away from its nonpharmaceutical health care businesses to focus even more narrowly on drugs. Mr. Cornelius, in a presentation, said Bristol-Myers would sell its medical imaging division, which is based in North Billerica, Mass. The unit employs about 800 people, 400 of them in North Billerica. The company might also sell its baby formula business, Mead Johnson Nutritionals, based in Evansville, Ind., and its ConvaTec products business, based in Skillman, N.J. ConvaTec specializes in products for wound care and ostomies  surgical openings in the abdomen to eliminate bodily wastes. Analysts have said Mead Johnson and ConvaTec together might bring in about $13 billion if sold. After its overhaul, Bristol-Myers, which has been based in Manhattan since the 1940s, is expected to maintain a mere toehold in the city. A spokesman said the company was expected to vacate all but one floor of its headquarters at 345 Park Avenue, where it occupied 550,000 square feet as recently as 10 years ago. Bristol-Myers has announced plans to streamline operations before. Its past efforts, however, have not been seen as having much effect on expenses. “Bristol has really been unable to cut costs on an absolute basis,” Jon LeCroy, a pharmaceutical analyst for Natixis Bleichroeder, said in a telephone interview. The company also announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend for the first time since 2002, to 31 cents a share from the current 28 cents. The stock, which has ranged from about $25 to $32 in the last year, closed yesterday at $29.26, up 20 cents.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/business/25drug.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Bristol-Myers to Buy a Biotech Company<date>Published: September 25, 2007</date><text>Bristol-Myers Squibb said yesterday that it would pay $430 million for Adnexus Therapeutics, a privately held biotechnology company whose lead product is a cancer drug in the earliest stages of human trials. Bristol-Myers agreed in February to pay about $30 million over three years to help Adnexus develop its class of drugs, called Adnectins.

Anders Hove, a Venrock general partner, said Adnectins have properties similar to those of monoclonal antibodies, the class of biotech drugs being used to treat an increasing range of cancers and inflammatory diseases. “But Adnectins are smaller and different from monoclonal antibodies,” and in that way avoid infringing patents of monoclonal antibodies, he said.

Even among the rash of recent insider-trading cases, this one  set up by Mr. Plotkin and another former Goldman employee, David Pajcin  stood out. It drew on information from three sources: a young analyst at Merrill Lynch; prepublication issues of BusinessWeek magazine; and tips from a grand jury investigation into Bristol-Myers Squibb. Mr. Plotkin was arrested in April 2006. He pleaded guilty to eight counts of insider trading and one count of conspiracy. Our client has decided to accept the responsibility and mitigate the damage that has been caused, a lawyer for Mr. Plotkin, Edward Little, said yesterday. He is the latest in the case to plead guilty. Stanislav Shpigelman, a 24-year-old former Merrill analyst, pleaded guilty to divulging information illegally on Adidas-Salomons acquisition of Reebok International. The deal earned the network $6.2 million. Mr. Pajcin has been cooperating with prosecutors for more than a year. Mr. Plotkin is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 30. The agreement he reached with prosecutors recommends a sentence of 57 to 71 months. He still faces an insider-trading complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discovery in that case is delayed pending the resolution of charges against another accused member of the network, Juan Renteria. By the time Mr. Plotkin graduated from Harvard in 2000, he had earned a reputation for competitiveness in academics and ballroom dancing. He met Mr. Pajcin at Goldman, where the two took divergent paths: Mr. Pajcin left after five and a half months while Mr. Plotkin rose to become an associate in the fixed-income trading division. By November 2004, Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Pajcin had met with Mr. Shpigelman at a Russian day spa in lower Manhattan, where the two persuaded the Merrill analyst to feed them tips in exchange for a share in the profits. In the second plot, Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Pajcin hired two men, Nickolaus Shuster and Mr. Renteria, to work at a BusinessWeek printing plant in Wisconsin. The goal was to execute trades based on information from the magazines Inside Wall Street column. For the third branch of the scheme, the two men paid Jason C. Smith, a postal worker in Jersey City, to give them information from a grand jury inquiry into Bristol-Myers Squibb, in which he was a juror. Based on information Mr. Smith provided in spring 2005, Mr. Pajcin sold short 2,000 shares of Bristol-Myers stock, betting that the price would fall. But the trades proved unprofitable. At the time of Mr. Smiths arrest last spring, prosecutors said that it was the first instance of insider trading based on the violation of a grand jurys oath of secrecy. Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin used the information to execute trades in various accounts, including those of Mr. Pajcins aunt, Sonia Anticevic, and his girlfriend, who was an exotic dancer. The two also gave the information to others, according to the S.E.C., ranging from Mr. Plotkins father to several traders in Europe. Of all the plots, the information from Mr. Shpigelman proved the most profitable, earning most of the $6.7 million. But it raised a red flag with investigators, who noticed robust options trading before the announcements of several deals.

A slim sales increase helped raise second-quarter profit for Bristol-Myers Squibb, which raised its 2007 outlook and offered a 2008 forecast, citing confidence in controlling costs and increasing sales. Amgen reported net income of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents a share, for the quarter that ended June 30, compared with $14 million, or 1 cent a share, in the same period last year. Revenue grew slightly to $3.73 billion, from $3.6 billion in the year-ago period. The company said that on an adjusted basis, excluding the cost of expensing stock options and other charges, its net profit was $1.27 billion, or $1.12 a share, compared with $1.24 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected net profit of $1.06 per share on revenues of $3.7 billion. Analysts consider Amgens adjusted earnings excluding stock options expense in their estimates. This has been a difficult period and this quarters low growth is a reflection of that reality, Amgens chairman and chief executive, Kevin Sharer, said. That said, we are making progress on many fronts to change this trend and return Amgen to strong future performance. Still, the company said it was on track to deliver growth at the low end of its previous full-year earnings forecast of $4.30 a share. Worldwide sales of its anemia-treating drug Aranesp decreased 10 percent, to $949 million, in the second quarter in reaction to the Food and Drug Administration finding that the drug should carry a stronger warning label when used in cancer patients with anemia. The warning label addition called for doctors to use the lowest possible dose of the drug. Aranesp was the companys best-selling drug last year, with $4.12 billion in sales. The F.D.A. also decided that additional studies were needed to ensure the safety of anemia drugs, including Amgens Epogen and Johnson &amp; Johnsons Procrit. Sales of Epogen increased 2 percent in the quarter, to $624 million, because of a growing patient population, offset in part by lower doses and demand, the company said. Shares of Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, fell $1, or 1.8 percent, to $56.16 at the end of regular trading Thursday. They gained 57 cents in extended trading after the second-quarter results were released. Bristol-Myerss profit rose nearly 6 percent to $706 million, or 36 cents a share, on a 1 percent increase in revenue to $4.93 billion. The blood-thinner Plavix again led sales for the company, rising 4 percent to $1.19 billion. James M. Cornelius, the chief executive, said he expected the drug to drive growth for the company over the next few years. He said the company would cut its work force by the end of the year as part of a cost-cutting program, though exact details are not expected until December. Bristol-Myerss goal is to streamline operations while investing more in specialty pharmaceuticals and biologic-based drug development over the next three years, Mr. Cornelius said.

Judge Patti B. Saris of United States District Court in Boston found the companies liable in a nationwide class-action lawsuit over drugs administered by doctors. She dismissed claims against Johnson &amp; Johnson while giving plaintiffs’ lawyers until Aug. 1 to provide calculations of damages for the other companies. The plaintiffs argued that the drug makers had sold medications to doctors at steep discounts to the “average wholesale price” that Medicare and pension funds paid, while secretly encouraging them to claim full reimbursement from insurers. The plaintiffs are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. In a 183-page opinion, Judge Saris wrote: “The Medicare statute itself created a perverse incentive by pegging the nationwide reimbursement for billions of drug transactions a year to a price reported by the pharmaceutical industry, thus putting the proverbial pharmaceutical fox in charge of the reimbursement chicken coop. The different pharmaceutical companies unfairly took advantage of the system by setting sky-high prices with no relation to the marketplace.” The judge found that AstraZeneca, which is based in London, acted “unfairly and deceptively” by causing the publication of false and inflated average wholesale prices for its prostate cancer drug Zoladex, which exceeded doctors’ acquisition costs by as much as 169 percent. Bristol-Myers, of New York, caused the publication of false and inflated average wholesale prices for five drugs, including Taxol, which had spreads as high as 500 percent. Warrick, a subsidiary of Schering-Plough, which is based in Kenilworth, N.J., inflated average wholesale prices for its generic drug albuterol sulfate in a range of 100 percent to 800 percent, the judge said. A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca, Laura King, said that her company “has competed responsibly with respect to pricing and marketing of drugs, and we have acted at all times in accordance with the law.” A Bristol-Myers spokeswoman, Laura Hortas, said the company believes that it “is not responsible for the average wholesale price reimbursement benchmark used by private insurers and Medicare, and that its own pricing, sales and marketing practices were fair and reasonable.” The company plans to appeal a damages award, Ms. Hortas said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Judge Sidney Stein's Opinion (pdf) Judge Sidney H. Stein, who issued the decision, had signaled in a preliminary ruling last fall that he would probably uphold the patent, which is not scheduled to expire until 2011. Even though the ruling had been anticipated, Plavix is such an important product for both companies that their shares rose yesterday in New York. Bristols stock gained $1.27, or 4.19 percent, closing at $31.58. American depositary receipts of Sanofi-Aventis closed up 24 cents, at $41.59. In addition to upholding the Plavix patent, Judge Stein prohibited the generic-drug producer Apotex from selling its copy of the drug in the United States. Judge Stein also said he would schedule a hearing to determine damages to be paid by Apotex, which flooded the market with more than $1 billion of its drug last summer, severely cutting into earnings of both Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis. The total demand for Plavix in 2006 was not clear because of the generic competition, but analysts view the drug, which is intended to prevents blood clots, as a potentially $8 billion worldwide franchise. The ruling, while an important development for the brand-name manufacturers, was bittersweet. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis, which is based in Paris, had been so intent on settling the patent litigation with Apotex before trial last year that they negotiated away the right to collect the triple damages that are generally allowed when companies violate patents held by competitors. Those negotiations will reduce the ultimate amount of any damages payable by Apotex to 50 percent of its total sales of generic Plavix, or clopidogrel bisulphate  an estimated penalty of $500 million to $600 million. The agreement to limit damages was one of the considerations that prompted Apotex to ship its product last year. Those shipments continued for only a few weeks last August before Judge Stein shut them down, but it was long enough for Apotex to flood the market, cutting into Plavix sales. The judges ruling yesterday closed another chapter in an unusual story that began in the summer of 2006 when federal agents searched Bristol-Myerss headquarters in Manhattan. The search followed accusations that the companies had entered into a secret side deal to thwart a regulatory review of the proposed patent settlement. Under an unrelated consent decree, Bristol-Myers had been bound to disclose the details of any such patent settlement deals to the Federal Trade Commission. Last week, it pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with the attempted Plavix settlement, and agreed to pay a fine of $1 million. The slew of errors in judgment that were made along the way were very big, said Thomas C. Carey, a Boston business lawyer, who noted that the companies had grossly misjudged the strength of their patent. Apotex, which is based in Toronto, promised to appeal yesterdays decision. But in a note to clients, a Banc of America Securities analyst, Christopher Schott, said the chances were low that Judge Steins ruling would be overturned on appeal. Mr. Schott also predicted that the ruling would reinvigorate speculation about an attempt by Sanofi-Aventis to take over Bristol-Myers. Correction: June 20, 2007 An article in Business Day yesterday about a federal court decision that upheld the patent on Plavix, a blood thinner marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, misstated the potential financial damages that the Canadian drug maker Apotex might have to pay the companies for selling a generic version last year. The potential damages could be $500 million to $600 million, not $500,000 to $600,000.

Bristols stock gained $1.27, or 4.19 percent, closing at $31.58. American depositary receipts of Sanofi-Aventis closed up 24 cents, at $41.59. In addition to upholding the Plavix patent, Judge Stein prohibited the generic-drug producer Apotex from selling its copy of the drug in the United States. Judge Stein also said he would schedule a hearing to determine damages to be paid by Apotex, which flooded the market with more than $1 billion of its drug last summer, severely cutting into earnings of both Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis. The total demand for Plavix in 2006 was not clear because of the generic competition, but analysts view the drug, which is intended to prevents blood clots, as a potentially $8 billion worldwide franchise. The ruling, while an important development for the brand-name manufacturers, was bittersweet. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis, which is based in Paris, had been so intent on settling the patent litigation with Apotex before trial last year that they negotiated away the right to collect the triple damages that are generally allowed when companies violate patents held by competitors. Those negotiations will reduce the ultimate amount of any damages payable by Apotex to 50 percent of its total sales of generic Plavix, or clopidogrel bisulphate  an estimated penalty of $500 million to $600 million. The agreement to limit damages was one of the considerations that prompted Apotex to ship its product last year. Those shipments continued for only a few weeks last August before Judge Stein shut them down, but it was long enough for Apotex to flood the market, cutting into Plavix sales. The judges ruling yesterday closed another chapter in an unusual story that began in the summer of 2006 when federal agents searched Bristol-Myerss headquarters in Manhattan. The search followed accusations that the companies had entered into a secret side deal to thwart a regulatory review of the proposed patent settlement. Under an unrelated consent decree, Bristol-Myers had been bound to disclose the details of any such patent settlement deals to the Federal Trade Commission. Last week, it pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with the attempted Plavix settlement, and agreed to pay a fine of $1 million. The slew of errors in judgment that were made along the way were very big, said Thomas C. Carey, a Boston business lawyer, who noted that the companies had grossly misjudged the strength of their patent. Apotex, which is based in Toronto, promised to appeal yesterdays decision. But in a note to clients, a Banc of America Securities analyst, Christopher Schott, said the chances were low that Judge Steins ruling would be overturned on appeal. Mr. Schott also predicted that the ruling would reinvigorate speculation about an attempt by Sanofi-Aventis to take over Bristol-Myers. Correction: June 20, 2007 An article in Business Day yesterday about a federal court decision that upheld the patent on Plavix, a blood thinner marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, misstated the potential financial damages that the Canadian drug maker Apotex might have to pay the companies for selling a generic version last year. The potential damages could be $500 million to $600 million, not $500,000 to $600,000.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/business/15bristol.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Drug Maker Ending 2 Years of Probation<date>Published: June 15, 2007</date><text>A two-year probation for Bristol-Myers Squibb ends today, freeing the company from federal supervision after a major accounting scandal and other misconduct.

The case involved accusations that the company had entered a secret deal to head off generic competition to Plavix, its biggest-selling product. The investigation began last summer with a search of the company’s Manhattan headquarters by federal agents and it led to the dismissal of the chief executive, Peter R. Dolan. But the investigation ended with relatively minor charges against the company. During a 30-minute hearing in federal court here, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina fined Bristol-Myers $1 million. The sentence had been worked out beforehand in an agreement between the company and the Justice Department’s antitrust division. While the company pleaded guilty to making false statements, after the hearing it issued a statement saying that it was merely taking responsibility for the actions of one former executive. “First and foremost, from our perspective there was no ‘side agreement’ of any kind with Apotex not to launch an authorized generic version of Plavix,” the Bristol-Myers chief executive, James M. Cornelius, said in a letter to employees. The accusations involved statements reportedly made by Dr. Andrew Bodnar, a former executive of Bristol-Myers. Dr. Bodnar, an adviser to Mr. Dolan, had been given an important assignment last year  settle a patent dispute with the Canadian generic drug maker Apotex. Apotex had threatened to market a generic version of Plavix before the patent expired in 2011. The threat, and a related federal court case in Manhattan, had weighed heavily on Bristol-Myers’s stock. During settlement negotiations in May 2006, Dr. Bodnar reportedly suggested that Bristol-Myers would not market its own generic version of Plavix. Brand-name drug makers frequently sell generic versions of drugs to compete with generic manufacturers. Such an agreement would have given Apotex exclusive generic rights to the drug for at least six months. Under an existing consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, any such settlement agreement by Bristol-Myers had to be cleared by the agency. But an agreement by Bristol-Myers not to sell its own generic was never disclosed to the F.T.C., and the agency began investigating whether the companies had entered a secret “side deal.” In a letter to Bristol-Myers’ employees after Monday’s hearing and in a statement to the media, the company announced that it had entered the plea to take responsibility for the actions of its former senior executive, an apparent reference to Dr. Bodnar, but it insisted that there was never a secret deal with Apotex. Bristol-Myers said that the former executive  a reference to Dr. Bodnar  made statements that “he expected to oppose personally the launch of an authorized generic in the future,” that he “expected to advocate against such a launch,” and that he implied “that the company’s former C.E.O. shared his views.” Neither Dr. Bodnar, who is no longer with the company, nor Mr. Dolan has been charged with any wrongdoing. Both have repeatedly declined to comment. The patent case, meanwhile, was not settled and was tried in January. A ruling is pending.

Many doctors say those profits did not affect their prescribing patterns. But drug makers evidently believed that they did. Industry documents that have emerged in a federal civil lawsuit in Boston show that big pharmaceutical companies sometimes calculated to the penny the profits that doctors could make from their drugs. Sales representatives shared those profit estimates with doctors and their staffs, the documents show. In one PowerPoint presentation from 2000, a Bristol-Myers Squibb executive told employees that oncologists’ biggest concern was “Reimbursement Today, Reimbursement Tomorrow, Reimbursement!” Dr. Robert Geller, an oncologist who worked in private practice from 1996 to 2005 before leaving to join a biotechnology company, said that cancer doctors knew the profits they could make and in some cases would change treatment regimens or offer unnecessary care to make extra money. “It’s clear that physicians stopped making decisions based on what made scientific or clinical sense in lieu of what made better business sense,” Dr. Geller said. As the use and price of cancer drugs skyrocketed during the 1990s, the profits that doctors could make by prescribing drugs went from a minor source of income to the major driver of incomes for oncologists. A Bristol-Myers document from 2001 shows that oncologists made about 65 percent of their revenue, and a similar percentage of their net income, on drug profits. The documents were gathered for a lawsuit that is before Judge Patti B. Saris of the Federal District Court in Boston. In the suit, cancer patients and health insurers contend that drug makers caused them to be overcharged for oncology medicines, because the list prices at which the health care plans reimbursed doctors were much higher than the actual prices that doctors paid. Because of the complexity of the lawsuit, which was initially filed in 2001, the case has been broken into different classes of plaintiffs and defendants. The first trial in the suit was last November and December in a bench trial before Judge Saris, who has not ruled. In that trial, the defendants were AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Schering-Plough  four of the world’s 20 largest drug companies. While many of the documents in the lawsuit remain sealed, the exhibits used in the first trial are part of the public record. They show that representatives for the companies brought spreadsheets to oncologists’ offices to show doctors how much they could make. For example, in 1998 Schering-Plough told its representatives that its drug Intron-A, a treatment for bladder cancer, could produce a profit for each patient of “$2,373.84 for our physicians just on the drug alone.” Pitching Zoladex, a treatment for prostate cancer, a sales representative for AstraZeneca was more blunt. “DO THE MATH!” he wrote in a letter to a group of urologists in Arizona.

The company said that under a preliminary agreement with the Department of Justice, it would plead guilty to two counts of making false statements to a federal agency. The charges, which could result in a fine of up to $1 million, are less serious than the original antitrust allegations that ignited a Federal Bureau of Investigation search at the company’s Manhattan offices last July. If proven, those antitrust charges could have resulted in far greater criminal and civil sanctions. Under such an agreement, the government would not pursue the more serious criminal charges in exchange for the guilty plea. The company did not disclose the full details of its agreement with the Justice Department, and no formal charges have yet been filed. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Gina Talamona, said, “We have no comment unless and until charges and a plea agreement are filed with the court.” It is unusual for corporations to plead guilty to criminal charges, which can leave them vulnerable to the loss of government business. But in a statement distributed to reporters yesterday, Bristol-Myers Squibb said it did not believe it would lose government business, indicating such an agreement may also be part of its deal with the Justice Department. Professor John C. Coffee, a securities law expert at Columbia University, said that by pleading guilty to making false statements, the company would avoid possible triple damages in related civil lawsuits. Such civil damages are allowed if companies are found guilty of criminal antitrust violations. The antitrust division of the Justice Department started the criminal investigation last July, when F.B.I. agents rifled through desks at the company offices on Park Avenue. One apparent target of the search was the company’s chief executive at the time, Peter R. Dolan, whom the board forced out several weeks later. The investigation involved allegations that the company reached a secret agreement with the Canadian drug maker Apotex to keep a generic copy of Plavix off the market. Bristol-Myers is a co-marketer of the drug with the French company, Sanofi-Aventis, under a patent that is not set to expire until 2011. Bristol-Myers’ share of the drug’s sales were $3.8 billion in 2005, making it the company’s largest product by far. Apotex, which has challenged the Plavix patent, had threatened to sell a generic copy of the drug last year. To avoid that, Mr. Dolan had tried to settle a lawsuit with Apotex. Terms of any such settlement deal by Bristol-Myers were supposed to be cleared by the Federal Trade Commission. But court papers and testimony in the civil case stated that Bristol-Myers had not disclosed major parts of the deal to the F.T.C. but instead had made a secret side deal. After the settlement deal collapsed, Apotex briefly sold its product in the United States for three weeks last August, flooding the market with up to six months of its product and undercutting Bristol-Myers’ business. Federal District Judge Sidney H. Stein, who is overseeing the patent dispute, eventually halted the sale of Apotex’s drug. He is expected to issue a ruling sometime this year on the validity of the Plavix patent. In papers and arguments before Judge Stein, a lawyer for Apotex said that an assistant to Mr. Dolan, Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar, had negotiated the secret agreement. Dr. Bodnar is no longer employed by Bristol-Myers. It was not clear yesterday whether charges would be filed against any former executives of the company. But in its statement, the company yesterday seemed to be admitting that one of its executives had made such a deal. The statement referred to “representations made by a former Bristol-Myers Squibb senior executive during the renegotiation of the proposed settlement agreement in May 2006 that were not disclosed to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.” Normally, cases involving potential criminal prosecutions of corporations are resolved through deferred-prosecution agreements, which amount to a form of criminal probation. Bristol-Myers Squibb is already operating under such a deferred- prosecution agreement involving accusations unrelated to the Plavix case. In the separate case, the company was accused of misleading investors about revenue through an inventory practice often referred to as “channel stuffing” that made it seem to be selling more product than it actually was. The company said yesterday that if it reached the plea deal, the United States attorney in Newark, Christopher Christie, would close that deferred-prosecution agreement as scheduled, on June 15, effectively ending the company’s period of probation.

And investors are not exactly cheering. Skip to next paragraph Brendan McDermid/Reuters James M. Cornelius After an eight-month search for a new chief executive, the drug maker Bristol-Myers said it would go with the interim chief, James M. Cornelius. His contract will be for two years, until May 2009, when Mr. Cornelius will be 65. Despite the companys also announcing better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, the stock fell on the news of the contract. The shares ended the day at $29.23, down 47 cents or 1.58 percent. Andrew R. J. Bonfield, the companys chief financial officer, explained the decline as investors taking the contract news as a sign that Bristol-Myers was no longer a takeover candidate. And Mr. Cornelius seemed to describe a go-it-alone strategy for now. We are trying to run the business as a freestanding independent company and to do the right things for the long-term value of the shareholders, he told investment analysts yesterday. But several analysts said that the appointment of Mr. Cornelius to a two-year position should have little bearing on whether the company might still be ripe for a takeover. Instead, they read Mr. Corneliuss appointment as a sign that Bristol-Myerss executive search had yielded no strong  or at least strongly interested  candidates. Gee, I wonder why people arent jumping up and down to take that job, said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities, noting the companys challenges. They include a government antitrust investigation; a pending federal court decision on a patent dispute over its key product, Plavix; and a federal monitoring agreement that is similar to criminal probation. We view this as a purely cosmetic move to minimize the distractions/questions created by his interim status, Ms. Ryan wrote in a note to Deutsche Bank clients. Ms. Ryan elaborated on her remarks in a telephone interview. Its difficult to have someone for a sustained period of time as the interim leader, she said. All organizations need leaders. Another analyst, Tim Anderson of Prudential Equity Group, told clients that he continued to think that a takeover might happen, with the most likely bidder Sanofi-Aventis, a French company that co-markets Plavix with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Speculation on such a deal has kept shares in the company trading at a 25 percent take-out premium over its peers. Mr. Cornelius had said all along he was not interested in running the company on a permanent basis. After he was credited with helping engineer the $27 billion sale of the medical device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific in early 2006, Mr. Cornelius had planned to spend more time at his second home in Maui. But last September, he was selected from the Bristol-Myers board to take over temporarily for Peter R. Dolan, who was fired as chief after Federal Bureau of Investigation agents searched the companys Manhattan headquarters. The raid was part of an investigation into allegations the company lied to the Federal Trade Commission about its dealings with Apotex, a Canadian generic drug maker. Since then, Mr. Cornelius has called himself a reluctant volunteer. Yesterday, though, he described a change of heart. The longer I was here, Mr. Cornelius said, the more interested and confident I became that the prospects and opportunities were worth redeciding my retirement plans. In his interim role, Mr. Cornelius appears to have attacked the job with zeal, making a point of scheduling visits to all the companys units. At a baby formula division in Indiana that is owned by Bristol-Myers, employees several months ago gave Mr. Cornelius a life-size statue of Peyton Manning, the quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. Mr. Cornelius, who lives in Indianapolis, owns Colts season tickets. Ive thrown myself into the job 24/7  other than the Super Bowl, Mr. Cornelius said yesterday. James. D. Robinson III, the companys chairman, praised Mr. Corneliuss efforts. Hes restored momentum, moved quickly to streamline operations, build the business, and hold down costs, Mr. Robinson said. Our performance in the quarter is evidence of the solid progress weve made under Jims leadership. Bristol-Myers yesterday reported earnings per share of 38 cents, some 15 cents higher than analysts had expected, in large part because sales of Plavix, an anticlotting medicine, had held up better than many had feared. Sales for the quarter were down 4 percent, to $4.48 billion, partly from residual weakness in Plavix, which had been hurt by intense competition from Apotex. In three weeks last August, Apotex flooded the market with a six-month supply of a generic version of the drug. A federal judge ordered a halt to Apotexs shipments, but pills already in the distribution pipeline were not recalled. Meanwhile, Apotexs challenge of the Plavix patent continues to play out in federal court in Manhattan, where a decision is expected as early as June. Many analysts predict Bristol-Myers will win that case. Yesterday, the company said it had overestimated the amount of Apotexs generic product in the market, which was part of the reason it raised its original earnings guidance for the year by 10 cents, revising it to $1.30 to $1.40 per share. The company also announced a partnership with Pfizer to develop and market the experimental product apixaban, also for blood clots. The partnership is seen as continuing Bristol-Myerss strategy to spread research and development risks, as well as marketing costs.

Cornelius After an eight-month search for a new chief executive, the drug maker Bristol-Myers said it would go with the interim chief, James M. Cornelius. His contract will be for two years, until May 2009, when Mr. Cornelius will be 65. Despite the companys also announcing better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, the stock fell on the news of the contract. The shares ended the day at $29.23, down 47 cents or 1.58 percent. Andrew R. J. Bonfield, the companys chief financial officer, explained the decline as investors taking the contract news as a sign that Bristol-Myers was no longer a takeover candidate. And Mr. Cornelius seemed to describe a go-it-alone strategy for now. We are trying to run the business as a freestanding independent company and to do the right things for the long-term value of the shareholders, he told investment analysts yesterday. But several analysts said that the appointment of Mr. Cornelius to a two-year position should have little bearing on whether the company might still be ripe for a takeover. Instead, they read Mr. Corneliuss appointment as a sign that Bristol-Myerss executive search had yielded no strong  or at least strongly interested  candidates. Gee, I wonder why people arent jumping up and down to take that job, said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities, noting the companys challenges. They include a government antitrust investigation; a pending federal court decision on a patent dispute over its key product, Plavix; and a federal monitoring agreement that is similar to criminal probation. We view this as a purely cosmetic move to minimize the distractions/questions created by his interim status, Ms. Ryan wrote in a note to Deutsche Bank clients. Ms. Ryan elaborated on her remarks in a telephone interview. Its difficult to have someone for a sustained period of time as the interim leader, she said. All organizations need leaders. Another analyst, Tim Anderson of Prudential Equity Group, told clients that he continued to think that a takeover might happen, with the most likely bidder Sanofi-Aventis, a French company that co-markets Plavix with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Speculation on such a deal has kept shares in the company trading at a 25 percent take-out premium over its peers. Mr. Cornelius had said all along he was not interested in running the company on a permanent basis. After he was credited with helping engineer the $27 billion sale of the medical device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific in early 2006, Mr. Cornelius had planned to spend more time at his second home in Maui. But last September, he was selected from the Bristol-Myers board to take over temporarily for Peter R. Dolan, who was fired as chief after Federal Bureau of Investigation agents searched the companys Manhattan headquarters. The raid was part of an investigation into allegations the company lied to the Federal Trade Commission about its dealings with Apotex, a Canadian generic drug maker. Since then, Mr. Cornelius has called himself a reluctant volunteer. Yesterday, though, he described a change of heart. The longer I was here, Mr. Cornelius said, the more interested and confident I became that the prospects and opportunities were worth redeciding my retirement plans. In his interim role, Mr. Cornelius appears to have attacked the job with zeal, making a point of scheduling visits to all the companys units.

Icahn, said yesterday that profit fell 87 percent because the company received less money from a marketing partner. First-quarter net income slid to $28.8 million, or 33 cents a share, matching analysts expectations, from $229.6 million, or $2.51 a share, a year earlier, ImClone said in a statement. In the first quarter of 2006, the company received a one-time $250 million payment from its partner, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, which is also ImClones biggest investor. United States sales of Erbitux, a treatment for cancer of the colon, head and neck that is ImClones only product, climbed 16 percent to $160.1 million. Erbitux is gaining from a stream of new research, including the first data to show the drug used alone can extend the lives of patients who have no other treatment options. Revenue, including royalties, fell to $141.5 million from $245.1 million in the period a year earlier, when ImClone reported the Bristol-Myers payment. ImClone receives about 39 percent of the drugs sales through the partnership, and gets royalties for European sales from Merck of Germany. The British drug maker AstraZeneca said yesterday that it might cut as many as 950 jobs in Germany because the company has not been able to sell some products in the country. About 400 jobs at its production site in Plankstadt are part of a plan announced earlier this year to eliminate 3,000 positions worldwide over the next three years, a spokesman, Friedrich von Heyl, said. AstraZeneca is also reducing as many as 550 sales and administrative jobs because it has not been able to introduce products in Germany as expected, including its Crestor cholesterol-lowering medicine and its failed blood thinner Exanta, the company said. Another drug maker, Bayer, said that its net income surged to 2.8 billion euros ($3.8 billion) from 600 million euros. Its profit included a gain of almost 2.2 billion euros from the sale of part of Bayers diagnostics unit and the H. C. Starck chemicals division. Sales for Bayer rose 23 percent to 8.3 billion euros, helped by Betaseron, a multiple sclerosis treatment, and Yasmin contraceptives, acquired in the 17 billion-euro takeover of Schering.

The Federal Trade Commission served the drug makers last month with formal requests for records connected with a settlement that the companies made with a Canadian company to stall sales of cheaper, copycat pills, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi said yesterday in regulatory filings. The trade commission has said it is looking into other drug company settlements that delay generic competition in return for money or other compensation to the generic drug company. Congress, meanwhile, is considering a measure that would outlaw certain types of agreements. An F.T.C. spokesman, Mitch Katz, confirmed that civil investigative demands, which act like subpoenas, had been issued but declined to comment on the investigation. The agreement with the Canadian company, Apotex, set off inquiries by legal authorities. In February, a federal prosecutor in New Jersey said that Bristol-Myers had not violated securities laws in trying to delay generic Plavix. A separate criminal antitrust investigation by the Justice Department is pending. The bungled deal also led to the ouster of Bristol-Myers’s chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, in September and prompted speculation that the company might be for sale. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi said that they would cooperate with the investigations. Sanofi owns the patent on the drug, and Bristol-Myers sells it in the United States. “We will not speculate on the F.T.C.’s reasons for initiating an investigation,” a Bristol-Myers spokesman, Tony Plohoros, said. A Sanofi spokesman, Marc Greene, also declined to comment, as did an Apotex spokesman, Steve Giuli. Plavix revenue plunged 12 percent, to $5.5 billion, last year after Apotex flooded the American market with its copy of the drug. Apotex, based in Weston, Ontario, sold its cheaper copies of Plavix for three weeks in August before a United States judge halted distribution.

Pay<date>Published: March 13, 2007</date><text>Responding to a drumbeat for better corporate governance, Bristol-Myers Squibb said today that it had agreed to a new guideline for establishing pay for its chief executive. Under the guideline, chief executive compensation at the company will require approval by a three-quarters vote of the independent directors, rather than just a majority. The decision followed a proposal submitted by Lucian Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School. Professor Bebchuk said that the company initially resisted his idea, but agreed last week. Mr. Bebchuk posted a history of his proposal online. In a statement, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, Tony Plohoros, said: “Our board of directors agreed in principle with Mr. Bebchuk’s proposal. As such, our board has adopted a new corporate governance guideline that calls for 75 percent of independent directors to approve C.E.O. compensation.” But Mr. Plohoros said the change by Bristol-Myers Squibb did not involve a bylaw change as initially requested by Professor Bebchuk, merely a change in guidelines. He also said that chief executive compensation had historically been approved unanimously, despite the prior guidelines that it be approved by a majority.

The company said that it has been informed by the United States attorney in Newark, Christopher J. Christie, that a review found no violation of securities laws or breach of an earlier consent order the company had signed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The review was done by Frederick Lacey, a former federal judge who had been appointed to oversee operations as part of a deferred prosecution agreement the company signed in 2005. That was meant to settle accusations that it had misled investors through inventory manipulation. The filing, submitted to the S.E.C. late yesterday, said that Mr. Christie’s office had advised the company that the matters had been “fully remediated” and that he did not intend to take action. In a statement last night, Bristol-Myers said the decision suggested that the company was on track to bring an end to the deferred prosecution agreement in Newark as scheduled on June 15. “If the company fulfills its obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement, we expect the U.S. Attorney for the district of New Jersey would dismiss the complaint against the company on June 15,” the company said in a statement.

So yesterday, all it took was one rumor printed as fact to incite a buying frenzy. Shares of both Bristol-Myers Squibb and its supposed suitor, Sanofi-Aventis, traded heavily yesterday on speculation that the companies might merge to form one of the world’s largest drug companies. But yesterday people close to the companies denied the report, which appeared in the French weekly La Lettre de L’Expansion. The report said that Bristol-Myers, based in New York, had signed a premerger agreement to join forces with Sanofi-Aventis, a significantly larger French company, in a deal that would close this year. Such a merger would create a corporate behemoth, which at yesterday’s closing share prices would be the second-largest pharmaceutical company, behind Pfizer, with market capitalization of about $172 billion. Officially, spokesmen for both Bristol-Myers and Sanofi declined to comment yesterday, and neither company officially denied the report. During an interview yesterday with Bloomberg Television, Sanofi’s chairman, Jean-François Dehecq, responded to a question about the merger rumors by saying, “I am not ready to answer this question.” Just last week, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers had vehemently denied that the company was actively seeking a merger or takeover. Still, the two companies have held exploratory talks in the past, the people close to the companies said, and some deal may be pursued in the future even if there are no current discussions. And the credibility of La Lettre and the firm wording of its report gave the story credence, prompting a run-up in Bristol-Myers’s share price yesterday. Bristol-Myers Squibb shares soared on the rumors, at one point reaching a 52-week high of $28.26 before closing at $27.43, up $1.22, or 4.65 percent. American depository receipts in Sanofi-Aventis declined 77 cents, to close at $44.57, or down 1.7 percent, in New York trading. One reason a merger makes sense is that the companies already jointly market the blockbuster anticoagulant Plavix and the blood pressure medicine Avapro, products with a worldwide sales value of more than $8 billion. A combined company could market those products under one management structure. Plavix is Bristol-Myers’s largest product and Sanofi’s second largest. The marketing arrangements had fueled speculation for months that the companies were likely merger partners. That speculation has grown since September, when Bristol-Myers fired its chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, and appointed an interim chief, James M. Cornelius, after bungled patent negotiations over Plavix with a Canadian generic drug maker. Since then, no permanent successor to Mr. Dolan has been named, increasing speculation that Bristol-Myers was in play. And there have been other signs a merger was being contemplated. Bristol-Myers recently announced agreements with several top managers that would allow them to walk away with significant compensation in the event of demotions, transfers or cuts in pay. In a note to clients yesterday, a Banc of America Securities analyst, Christopher Schott, said the companies’ overlaps in several therapeutic areas  including treatments for diabetes, cancer and blood clots  would let a merged company cut costs and become more competitive. Another reason Bristol-Myers might be an attractive acquisition is its pipeline of new products, some in later stages of development, including two diabetes products it recently agreed to develop with AstraZeneca. Some analysts have criticized Sanofi’s pipeline and noted that its only potential blockbuster, the weight-loss and diabetes drug Acomplia, has faced regulatory delays in the United States. “Sanofi has a large legacy of mature products and its only potential blockbuster in the near term is Acomplia,” said Paul Diggle, a London-based analyst for Nomura Code Securities. Some analysts, however, have worried that Sanofi is still digesting its $65 billion takeover of the French drug maker Aventis Pharmaceuticals in 2004 and that it would be too soon for it to absorb another large company. Mr. Schott also noted that there was still a chance the companies could lose the Plavix franchise. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi are currently in federal court in Manhattan, in a trial that began last week, defending the patent on Plavix against a challenge by Apotex, a manufacturer of generics based in Toronto. “While we consider Bristol/Sanofi to have a high probability of winning the Plavix patent challenge after it was granted a preliminary injunction, the loss of the franchise is still a possibility,” Mr. Schott said. Because Bristol-Myers has been troubled recently, some shareholders see a takeover as the fastest way to bring about a revival. In the last five years, it has been plagued by federal and state investigations of its practices, as well as related shareholder lawsuits. The company recently announced plans to settle, for $499 million, an investigation by federal authorities in Massachusetts into its sales and marketing practices. That settlement is expected to require that the company sign a corporate integrity agreement with the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. The company is currently operating under a similar agreement with the United States attorney in Newark, Christopher J. Christie, after a settlement of a criminal investigation into whether it misled investors about its wholesale inventories. Mr. Dolan’s ouster in September followed efforts to settle the Plavix patent litigation that ended up enabling Apotex to sell its generic version for several weeks last August, flooding the United States market with more than $1 billion worth of the generic version. Shipments were eventually halted by the judge now overseeing the patent trial. Bristol-Myers reported a loss of $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 because of competition from that generic.

Sanofi and Bristol-Myers are trying to protect Plavix from competition with a cheaper version made by the generic drug maker Apotex, a privately held Canadian company that sold its copycat drug in the United States briefly last year before the federal court stopped the shipments. In opening arguments in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Evan Chesler, a lawyer for Sanofi and Bristol-Myers, said Apotex had no legal basis for its argument that the drug’s patent should be invalidated. “They have basically rewritten history,” he said, arguing before Judge Sidney H.

But an Apotex lawyer, Robert Breisblatt, said the patent should not stand, in part because the drug formula would have been obvious to another scientist in the field. Bristol-Myers, based in New York, sells Plavix in the United States for Sanofi, which is based in Paris. Plavix, Bristol-Myers’s biggest-selling drug, had annual sales of $6 billion before the Apotex copy hit the United States market. Prescriptions for it fell 32 percent in the third quarter after the generic was shipped in August. In September, Bristol-Myers ousted its chief, Peter R. Dolan, and its general counsel, Richard K. Willard, for mishandling an effort to negotiate a deal with Apotex. More Articles in Business »A lawyer for Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb urged a federal judge yesterday to uphold the patent on the blockbuster anticlotting medication Plavix, as a trial over the drug’s future got under way. Sanofi and Bristol-Myers are trying to protect Plavix from competition with a cheaper version made by the generic drug maker Apotex, a privately held Canadian company that sold its copycat drug in the United States briefly last year before the federal court stopped the shipments. In opening arguments in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Evan Chesler, a lawyer for Sanofi and Bristol-Myers, said Apotex had no legal basis for its argument that the drug’s patent should be invalidated. “They have basically rewritten history,” he said, arguing before Judge Sidney H.

Skip to next paragraph Brendan McDermid/Reuters James M. Cornelius That is the view of the companys interim chief executive, James M. Cornelius, who on Friday compared the companys struggle with a generic competitor to a boxing competition. A less resilient, less solid management and employee base would have crumbled under a billion-dollar hit, Mr. Cornelius said during an interview at a company office here. We took a body blow, but we didnt go down for the count. Mr. Cornelius said the damage from last summers market onslaught by a generic copy of Bristol-Myerss blockbuster drug Plavix, a blood thinner, would exceed $1 billion, but the company had more or less already made up the money. The financial details of that comeback, he said, will be revealed next Thursday when the company releases its fourth-quarter results. The blow was dealt last summer by the Canadian company Apotex, which sold its Plavix imitator for only three weeks in August, before a federal judge ordered a halt. But during that period an estimated six-month supply of generic Plavix flooded the United States market. The episode followed bungled efforts to settle a patent dispute with Apotex. And it eventually cost the Bristol-Myers chief executive at the time, Peter R. Dolan, his job. Apotex has hardly gone away, though. Even as Mr. Cornelius expressed optimism yesterday about the companys future, lawyers were making final preparations to begin a trial Monday in federal court in Manhattan. There, Bristol-Myers and its marketing partner, the French company Sanofi-Aventis, will defend the Plavix patent against the Apotex challenge. The trials outcome will be critical for Bristol-Myers, which derives nearly a third of its revenue from Plavix. The drugs 2005 sales in this country were $3.8 billion and its use is growing. Worldwide sales of Plavix exceeded $6 billion in 2005, making it the second-largest drug, behind Lipitor from Pfizer. In a four-week trial where much of the testimony is expected to involve scientific minutiae, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi will be asking Judge Sidney H. Stein to uphold their Plavix patent. Starting Monday is an important historic event for this company, Mr. Cornelius said, adding that the company was so optimistic about its chances of winning the case that it is proceeding to break ground on a $750 million biologic drug plant in Devens, Mass. Bristol-Myers plans to give more details of its 2006 performance, including how it has compensated for the lost Plavix sales, on Thursday. The company has been predicting that earnings for the year will wind up at 97 cents a share. I dont think were going to disappoint anybody, said Mr. Cornelius, who is in some ways Bristol-Myers accidental chief executive. Nearly a year ago, after a long career at the drug maker Eli Lilly and then a stint as chairman and interim chief executive of the device maker Guidant, Mr. Cornelius thought he had engineered an early retirement from the pressured environment of big corporations. After closing the $27 billion sale of Guidant to Boston Scientific, following an exhaustive takeover battle with Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mr. Cornelius had planned to settle into a new life dominated by charity volunteering, long stretches at his second home in Maui and avid support for the Indianapolis Colts. An Indianapolis resident, he owns Colts season tickets on the 42-yard line. But Mr. Cornelius, who is 63, said he parachuted in, a somewhat reluctant volunteer to take the reins of Bristol-Myers in September after Mr. Dolans ouster. Mr. Cornelius had served on the Bristol-Myers Squibb board. Since then, the companys board has continued a search for a permanent replacement for Mr. Dolan  Mr. Cornelius said he was not interested in the job  and also has been exploring a sale or merger of the $52 billion company. Even as the patent trial begins, the company is the target of a federal investigation focusing on whether it violated federal antitrust laws in its attempt earlier last year to settle the litigation with Apotex. When those settlement talks unraveled, Apotex flooded the United States market with its generic version of the drug before Judge Stein ordered distribution to stop, ruling that it was likely that the Plavix patent would be upheld. Despite the judges ruling, Apotex had already shipped enough of its version of the drug that prescriptions for Plavix plunged 32 percent in the third quarter. The stock took a hit, too. Bristol-Myers shares, which had traded at nearly $26 in July, fell to just above $20 in August. The stock has since recovered, closing Friday at $26.63  a level that Mr. Cornelius said was partly a result of the companys strong pipeline of new products. Mr. Cornelius said yesterday that the market for blood thinners was still working through the remaining inventory of Apotexs drug, clopidogrel bisulfate, but that more than half of prescriptions were now being filled with the Bristol-Myers product, and its share was growing steadily. The trial also comes at an important time for United States patent law, in which courts lately have generally favored innovator companies. Meanwhile, a Supreme Court ruling is expected this year on a patent case, KSR International v. Teleflex Inc., involving automotive gas pedals. The key issue in that case  the question of what constitutes an obvious and, hence, invalid patent  could have a bearing on the Plavix patent. Among other arguments, Apotex has claimed that the formula for Plavix would have been obvious to a scientist, based on an older patent that expired in 2003. Judge Stein had rejected that argument during preliminary proceedings. If KSR raises the bar for nonobviousness, Judge Stein may need to rethink his conclusion that the Plavix patent is not obvious, said C. Scott Hemphill, an associate professor of law at Columbia University. Mr. Cornelius said the company had other options if Apotex won the Plavix case. If we lose we have a backup plan that changes the nature of everything we do, but we dont plan on losing, he said. Instead, he said, he sees 2007 as the beginning of a new era for the company, which recently signed a $1.35 billion deal with AstraZeneca to jointly develop two diabetes compounds. The company is also entertaining the idea of finding partners for some of its other products in the development pipeline, he said. When I first joined Eli Lilly, everybody said, I hope Lilly can someday be like Bristol-Myers Squibb,  Mr. Cornelius said, acknowledging that Bristol-Myers was no longer the industry role model. Id like to get it back there. Thats the target  07 is going to be the beginning of that. Correction: January 23, 2007 An article in Business Day on Saturday, about efforts by the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb to recover from a competitive challenge to its best-selling blood thinner, Plavix, misstated the board’s position on potential merger or takeover deals involving the company. While Bristol-Myers executives have said repeatedly that they would be open to considering such deals, the board has not actively pursued a merger or sale.

In real estate parlance, both are expensive and might seem to need too much tender loving care. The company’s leaders all but announced it was for sale last September. Four months later, though, no potential suitor has emerged  at least not publicly. Instead, Bristol-Myers has entered several comparatively small deals, including one yesterday in which it announced a partnership with the British company AstraZeneca to develop two diabetes compounds. One industry executive said recently that every large pharmaceutical company had looked at Bristol-Myers as a potential acquisition. But there are major deterrents to a quick sale: its price; two pending Justice Department investigations; and a looming patent trial involving the company’s blockbuster drug Plavix. That trial is set to begin Jan. 22 in Manhattan federal court. “C.E.O.’s rarely buy big companies with big patent issues,” said Dr. Gbola Amusa, European pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “The easiest way to lose your job as a C.E.O. is to buy a drug that isn’t there once you pay for it.” Bristol-Myers declined to comment yesterday on speculation involving the company’s possible takeover. A Bernstein analysis last fall discussed why other pharmaceutical companies were not rushing to buy Bristol-Myers, despite a research and development pipeline that is viewed as one of the most attractive in the industry. Cost is a reason. The analysis by Bernstein in October estimated the intrinsic value of Bristol-Myers at $21.50 a share. But the company’s shares closed up 34 cents yesterday, at $26.54. Judging by similar takeover deals in the past, shareholders would want a 20 to 30 percent premium  or about $30 a share  before they would be happy with a takeover. And many companies that might be interested in Bristol have lower price-earnings multiples. Acquiring Bristol-Myers would be bucking the norm in which high multiple companies usually acquire lower multiple companies. Investors also shy away from uncertainties like the big patent case. In that dispute the Canadian company Apotex is challenging the validity of the Bristol-Myers patent on the anticoagulant Plavix, a drug with an estimated United States market of nearly $4 billion. Sales of Plavix took a big hit last year after efforts to settle the patent case broke down. Apotex briefly flooded the market with its cheaper generic version of the drug, before a judge ordered a halt. That debacle led to the ouster of Bristol’s chief executive, Peter R. Dolan last September. Since then, the company has been run by an interim chief, the former Guidant chairman James M. Cornelius. The company’s moves in trying to settle the Plavix litigation are also the subject of an investigation by the Justice Department, which wants to know whether Bristol entered an anticompetitive agreement and hid it from the Federal Trade Commission. While the impact of that investigation might not be as big as a loss of Plavix, the uncertainty of a Justice Department inquiry diminishes Bristol’s appeal as a takeover candidate. “I don’t think anybody would put a multibillion-dollar potential liability there,” said Richard T. Evans, an industry consultant. “It’s more of a qualitative issue. Do you really want to be in the cross-hairs of the Justice Department?” Mr. Evans also said it was not clear whether the product development partnerships Bristol-Myers had recently entered were conducive to a sale of the company. In the announcement yesterday, the company said it had reached an agreement with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize two experimental diabetes drugs that were discovered by Bristol-Myers. The agreement was valued at as much as $1.35 billion for Bristol-Myers, with $100 million in upfront payments, and as much as $1.25 billion in milestone payments as the products are brought to market. The deal, the largest of three alliances the company has announced recently, appeared to be a favorable one for Bristol-Myers, according to Dr. Amusa, particularly since both products face uncertainties. AstraZeneca rose 83 cents, to $55.08. Andrew Bonfield, chief financial officer for Bristol-Myers, said in a telephone conference yesterday that the company, which does not have a large sales force for primary-care doctors, hopes to take advantage of AstraZeneca’s sales staff if the products come to market. Bristol-Myers also wants to reduce its financial risk in developing the products, Mr. Bonfield said. One big individual shareholder in Bristol-Myers, Dundas I. Flaherty of Los Angeles, had an optimistic take on yesterday’s deal. He saw it as a possible sign that AstraZeneca might wind up being the suitor Bristol has been waiting for  even though AstraZeneca’s chief executive several months ago said the company had little interest in mergers or acquisitions. “If Cornelius is testing the water on deals,” Mr. Flaherty said, “this is one way to get to know each other before we consummate something.” More Articles in Business »THE drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb brings to mind that vacant colonial for sale down the street.

That settlement, and separate special charges the company also announced yesterday, would wipe out Bristol-Myers fourth-quarter profit. But its shares rose on the indication that the company was resolving a big legal issue and tidying up its books, making it a more viable takeover candidate. The United States attorneys office in Boston, which first subpoenaed the records of Bristol-Myers in the matter in 2003, declined to confirm the announcement, saying it did not comment on such negotiations unless a final settlement has been signed. Bristol-Myers, based in New York, declined to disclose which years, which drugs and which practices the tentative agreement covers. But Jeff Macdonald, a company spokesman, confirmed previous reports that one product involved was the antipsychotic drug Abilify, one of the companys best sellers. A settlement on the terms described by Bristol-Myers would be the latest in a string of large payments the Justice Department has extracted from drug makers. Federal prosecutors have delved into practices like failing to tell the government about price discounts offered to other major customers. As a result, Medicare and other government health plans that are entitled to the lowest available price have frequently been overcharged. Reserves that Bristol-Myers plans to set aside for the settlement, along with $220 million in estimated pretax charges that the company announced separately yesterday and are related to previously announced debt restructuring, could leave the company with no net profit for the fourth quarter. But Bristol-Myers also signaled that its business was doing well by accounting measures that exclude special charges. On that basis, the company said it expected to finish the year at the high end of the range of $1.02 to $1.07 a share it had previously forecast to Wall Street. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 28 cents, to $26.05. Analysts said the charges reflected an effort to record the expenses in a year when earnings were already expected to be relatively weak, which could make future performance look stronger. In addition, some said, Bristol-Myers may be driving to eliminate legal uncertainties that hang over the company. Both actions could make the company more attractive to potential suitors. Legal issues tend to be really unknown quantities, said Seamus Fernandez, who follows the industry for Leerink Swann in Boston. Thus, he said, legal settlements make assessing the value of Bristol-Myers easier. Takeover speculation has surged since the ouster of Peter R. Dolan as chief executive in September. A director, James M. Cornelius, was named interim chief executive. As with previously negotiated Justice Department financial settlements with companies like GlaxoSmithKline, Schering Plough, and TAP Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers said it also expected to sign a corporate integrity agreement with regulators in the Health and Human Services Department who monitor industry compliance with federal insurance programs. Such agreements typically require companies to run employee training programs, set up hot lines to report rule violations and follow other practices listed in government compliance guidelines, according to Scot T. Hasselman, a health care lawyer at Reed Smith in Washington who is not involved in the Bristol-Myers case. They generally run for five years and often require the company to hire an independent auditor of compliance practices, Mr. Hasselman said. The antipsychotic drug Abilify covered in the settlement has become the companys best-selling product outside of its flagship cardiovascular group, whose sales are led by Plavix, an anticlotting drug, and Pravachol, which lowers cholesterol. Sales of Abilify totaled $920 million in the first nine months of 2006, up 28 percent on the year. Settlement of the Boston investigation would not clear Bristol-Myerss legal slate. The company faces, among other legal challenges, possible federal criminal securities fraud charges in connection with a scheme to record as sales products that it paid customers to store in their warehouses. According to a settlement agreement signed in July 2005, those charges will be dropped next summer if Bristol-Myers completes two years without further violations of practices specified in the agreement. But Wall Streets bigger concern is the legal morass that has grown out of Bristol-Myerss efforts to delay competition for Plavix from a generic version of the drug manufactured in Canada by Apotex. The litigation sprawls across antitrust and patent disagreements, and the Justice Department is investigating whether Bristol-Myers violated criminal statutes in its dealings with Apotex and Sanofi-Aventis, the French company that invented the drug. After negotiations between Apotex and Bristol-Myers broke down this year, Apotex began shipping the generic drug in August in huge quantities. A federal court in New York ordered a halt to further shipments in September but some supplies are still in the market. Bristol-Myers suffered as much as $600 million in lost sales in the third quarter, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The companies dispute is scheduled to go to trial in January.

Hasselman, a health care lawyer at Reed Smith in Washington who is not involved in the Bristol-Myers case. They generally run for five years and often require the company to hire an independent auditor of compliance practices, Mr. Hasselman said. The antipsychotic drug Abilify covered in the settlement has become the companys best-selling product outside of its flagship cardiovascular group, whose sales are led by Plavix, an anticlotting drug, and Pravachol, which lowers cholesterol. Sales of Abilify totaled $920 million in the first nine months of 2006, up 28 percent on the year. Settlement of the Boston investigation would not clear Bristol-Myerss legal slate. The company faces, among other legal challenges, possible federal criminal securities fraud charges in connection with a scheme to record as sales products that it paid customers to store in their warehouses. According to a settlement agreement signed in July 2005, those charges will be dropped next summer if Bristol-Myers completes two years without further violations of practices specified in the agreement. But Wall Streets bigger concern is the legal morass that has grown out of Bristol-Myerss efforts to delay competition for Plavix from a generic version of the drug manufactured in Canada by Apotex. The litigation sprawls across antitrust and patent disagreements, and the Justice Department is investigating whether Bristol-Myers violated criminal statutes in its dealings with Apotex and Sanofi-Aventis, the French company that invented the drug. After negotiations between Apotex and Bristol-Myers broke down this year, Apotex began shipping the generic drug in August in huge quantities. A federal court in New York ordered a halt to further shipments in September but some supplies are still in the market. Bristol-Myers suffered as much as $600 million in lost sales in the third quarter, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The companies dispute is scheduled to go to trial in January.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/04/business/04dolan.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Former Bristol-Myers Chief to Get $9.5 Million Package<date>Published: November 4, 2006</date><text>Bristol-Myers Squibb awarded its former chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, a $1.2 million severance payment plus enhanced pension benefits worth about $9.5 million in today’s dollars, the company disclosed yesterday to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Dolan was fired in September after a bungled effort to settle a patent dispute involving the company’s top-selling drug, Plavix, a blood thinner. As a result, a generic rival flooded the market with its copy of the drug and Bristol-Myers lost an estimated $600 million in sales in the third-quarter. While Mr. Dolan’s package was small compared with those awarded many departing chief executives, the company agreed to slightly increase his service years, resulting in extra pension benefits and restricted stock. Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant based in White Plains, N.Y., characterized Mr. Dolan’s $1.2 million severance payment as “fairly light” compared with severance packages for other chief executives, which often amount to twice the executive’s annual salary and bonus. A doubling of Mr. Dolan’s base salary and a bonus of $3.5 million would have given him a severance closer to $7 million. “He did not have contractual severance, it looks like they gave him the plan that applies to other people, and they didn’t sweeten his severance,” Mr. Foley said. “If you were a shareholder, and you were unhappy with his performance, at least you’d be relieved that they hadn’t reached into your pocket to give him more severance.” However, Mr. Dolan’s enhanced retirement package of nearly $9.5 million in today’s dollars seems “pretty substantial” considering his age, 50, Mr. Foley said. Bristol-Myers tacked on several months to a calculation of Mr. Dolan’s service years plus age, making him fully eligible for pension benefits under what is called the “rule of 70.” That also resulted in the vesting of 81,000 of Mr. Dolan’s unvested shares in restricted stock, valued at $1.95 million. He forfeited another 244,365 unvested shares and also forfeits his 2006 bonus. The package also allows Mr. Dolan to stay with the company as a $50,000-a-month consultant through April, and gives him $75,000 in “outplacement” services. Mr. Dolan also gets the full term to exercise stock options. As of the company’s last proxy statement in March, Mr. Dolan held options on nearly 3 million shares in company stock, but most of them are under water. Shares closed yesterday at $24.53 A statement released yesterday by Tony Plohoros, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers, said the company was grateful for Mr. Dolan’s service but added that the Plavix incident “had become an unfortunate distraction that shifted the focus away from the company’s accomplishments and continued execution of strategy. The board held Peter, as C.E.O., accountable.” Bristol-Myers also announced yesterday that it would pay James M. Cornelius, the former chairman of Guidant who is serving as the company’s interim chief, a base salary of $1.25 million plus a bonus of up to 170 percent.

The missteps by Bristol-Myers this year in negotiating a proposed patent settlement enabled the Canadian company, Apotex, to flood the market in August with a cheaper generic version of Plavix, a blood thinner. Bristol-Myers also disclosed yesterday that one of the federal investigations into its handling of the Plavix matter, a review by Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in Newark, had expanded to an examination of whether Bristol-Myers violated securities laws. The Plavix debacle largely accounted for the company’s decline in overall sales to $4.15 billion, compared with $4.76 billion in the quarter a year earlier. It was also partly responsible for sharply lower earnings of $338 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $964 million, or 49 cents a share, in the third quarter last year. The 2005 earnings included a significant one-time gain from the sale of the consumer medicines business. The lower sales and revenues at Bristol came as drug companies have generally been posting improved results for the quarter. GlaxoSmithKline said yesterday that its quarterly earnings were up 15 percent. Despite the bad news for Bristol, the company gave a slightly brighter outlook for the year than it issued in late summer, just after the generic Plavix flooded pharmacy shelves. Yesterday, the company raised its earning projections to at least 97 cents a share this year, rather than the 95 cents it previously predicted. That is partly because some orders for Plavix are still coming in. And yet, during a telephone conference with investment analysts yesterday, Andrew Bonfield, Bristol’s chief financial officer, said that there was enough generic Plavix in supply chains to last into early next year and possibly into the second quarter of 2007. That means Bristol-Myers could still be dealing with the inexpensive competition when a trial starts in Manhattan on Jan. 22 to decide whether its Plavix patent is valid. The outcome of that trial would determine whether Apotex has the right to ship additional supplies of the generic product. Currently, 70 percent to 75 percent of the prescriptions for Plavix are being filled by the generic supplies that Apotex shipped to the United States before Bristol-Myers obtained an injunction to block further shipments. The company’s fumbled plan to settle its dispute led to the generic company’s shipments and the dismissal of the Bristol-Myers chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, in September. The company is now led by an interim chief, the former Guidant chairman James M. Cornelius. Mr. Cornelius, speaking about the company’s future during a conference call with analysts, played down continuing speculation that Bristol-Myers was a takeover candidate. “My words to employees have been we’re not for sale,” Mr. Cornelius said. “The longer I’m here the more confident I become that Bristol-Myers Squibb has a wonderful future as an independent company.” Bristol-Myers said yesterday that Mr. Christie’s office was investigating whether the company violated a consent decree the company signed in 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement with the S.E.C. was a settlement of claims that Bristol-Myers misled investors about its financial outlook by lying about its wholesale inventories. The expanded Plavix investigation by Mr. Christie’s office is in addition to an investigation already under way by the Justice Department’s antitrust division into whether Bristol-Myers tried to hide details of its Apotex negotiations from government antitrust reviewers. The Plavix problems are coming at a time when demand for the drug is increasing. Prescriptions for the medicine and its generic equivalent were up 14 percent in the third quarter, an increase that is partly related to new advice from doctors that patients who have received drug-coated stents to keep their arteries open should continue Plavix therapy to avoid clotting around the stents. Plavix sales in 2005 were $3.5 billion in the United States, but probably would have surpassed $4 billion this year if not for the flood of generics. The company also said it had been harmed by generic competition to its cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol.

Skip to next paragraph Related DealBook: Sanofi Said to Be ImClones Mystery Bidder Shares of ImClone soared last week after the company announced that Carl C. Icahn, who holds a stake of nearly 14 percent in the company, had scuttled a potential takeover offer of $36 a share from a “major international pharmaceutical company” last month. The disclosure of a would-be suitor, which ImClone did not identify, became the latest point of contention in an escalating battle between Mr. Icahn and the company. Mr. Icahn said last week that ImClone was worth more than $36 a share “if it is run by competent people.” In trading yesterday, ImClone stock rose just over 1 percent, to $29.90, after Sanofi’s identity was reported by DealBook, a Web log published by nytimes.com. ImClone licenses a patent for the cancer drug Erbitux from the Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis, one of the largest drug companies in the world. Sanofi’s interest in ImClone suggested that the company was considering expansion in the United States and might indicate that it would look at other possible targets. The United States accounted for 35 percent of Sanofi’s net sales in 2005, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some analysts have said that Sanofi may be interested in Bristol-Myers Squibb, a company that has been seen as a potential takeover target since it ousted its chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, last month. Bristol markets Plavix, a best-selling drug used to fight blood clots, in partnership with Sanofi-Aventis. In a conference call with reporters last month, the chairman of Bristol-Myers, James D. Robinson III, declined to speculate on a possible sale of the company. In Bristol-Myers, Sanofi or another acquirer would get a significant piece of ImClone. Bristol-Myers is ImClone’s largest shareholder, with 17 percent. Bristol sells Erbitux in the United States and pays ImClone a royalty on these sales. The emergence of Sanofi’s interest may also give new life to ImClone’s attempts to find a buyer. Earlier this year, ImClone put itself up for sale, but after a six-month search, the company announced in August that it would remain independent. Calls to representatives of ImClone were not returned yesterday. Calls to Sanofi-Aventis were unsuccessful. ImClone, meanwhile, continues to do battle with Mr. Icahn, who is known for trying to shake up companies that he thinks are underperforming. Last month, ImClone shareholders voted Mr. Icahn and two allies onto the company’s board. Since then, he has filed a proposal urging shareholders to remove 6 other members of the 12-member board and add one of his nominees. In a proxy statement, ImClone has urged shareholders to reject Mr. Icahn’s proposal, arguing that “a balanced board is better positioned than one dominated by Mr. Icahn.” More Articles in Business »The European drug giant Sanofi-Aventis was the mystery bidder for the biotechnology company ImClone Systems last month, people involved in the transaction said yesterday.

Three years later, Mr. Dolan must be regretting that choice. The former judge, Frederick B. Lacey, gradually became entrenched at Bristol-Myers, and now serves as a court-authorized overseer monitoring the companys every activity. And last week, two days after celebrating his 86th birthday, Mr. Lacey successfully recommended that the board dismiss Mr. Dolan. Independent federal monitors like Mr. Lacey, who are often appointed under deferred-prosecution agreements, have become an increasingly popular way to deal with accusations of corporate crime in recent years. Their presence is held out as a way for companies to be sanctioned without risking their extinction and the related loss of jobs. At least 16 such agreements have been signed since 2001, involving large companies including Bank of New York, AOL and the Prudential Equity Group. But Mr. Lacey appears to have exercised unprecedented power in prompting Mr. Dolans ouster. And the episode has set off a debate whether Mr. Lacey represents a tougher-style monitor who may put new teeth into that role in corporate America  as some admirers hope  or whether, in the view of some critics, he has overstepped his authority at Bristol-Myers. It certainly is a wake-up call as to the power of these independent monitors in deferred-prosecution agreements, said James D. Cox, a professor of law at Duke University. I would see this as perhaps a new standard. For people familiar with Mr. Laceys career over nearly 60 years, his exercise of power is fully in character. As a crime-fighting federal prosecutor in New Jersey in the late 1960s and early 70s, Mr. Lacey was often in the headlines  famous for indictments his office obtained, including those of the mayor of Newark and members of the City Council there, as well as of notorious organized-crime figures. He was the outstanding U.S. attorney of his time, said former Judge Herbert J. Stern, who was an assistant prosecutor in Mr. Laceys office, and set a standard for the office in New Jersey which is emulated today. During his time as a federal judge in New Jersey from 1971 to 1986, Mr. Lacey was regarded as just as tough-minded. Later, in 1992, he was among those appointed by a federal judge to root out corruption in the Teamsters union, resulting in the expulsion of about 200 members on a variety of corruption charges. Bristol-Myers and Mr. Dolan, by comparison, might seem like relatively tame quarry. Through an e-mail message, Mr. Lacey declined to discuss his role in the company or his recommendations to the board, which also included the firing of the general counsel, Richard K. Willard, a former civil division chief at the Justice Department in the 1980s. But providing ammunition for both Mr. Laceys critics and admirers in his handling of Mr. Dolan and Mr. Willard, the company has said that Mr. Laceys findings did not involve a violation of the deferred-prosecution agreement from which his power derives. Bristol-Myers signed that agreement last year with the United States attorney in New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie. The drug maker employs 7,700 people in the state. The agreement required that Bristol-Myers conduct its self as a model corporate citizen after an accounting scandal that Mr. Dolan said he inherited when he became chief executive in 2001. Mr. Christie, who is known to regard Mr. Lacey as something of a role model and was instrumental in his appointment as the companys monitor, has said that one of the goals of the Bristol-Myers agreement was to change a corporate culture of secrecy and poor internal communications  situations that became apparent during his offices investigation into the accounting scandal. Mr. Dolan has not been available for comment since he was dismissed. The company has said it was his recent handling of a separate matter, a patent dispute over its bestselling drug, Plavix, that led to his ouster. Mr. Lacey, according to people briefed on the discussions, criticized Mr. Dolan for not adequately communicating with the board during a failed effort to settle the dispute with a Canadian generic drug maker, Apotex. A law professor at Wayne State University, Peter J. Henning, said business executives would regard Mr. Laceys actions in the Bristol-Myers case as a worrisome sign that prosecutors were reaching too far into the corporate boardroom. That is particularly so, he said, because both Mr. Lacey and Mr. Christie attended a meeting of the directors a week ago Monday, where Mr. Christie appeared to endorse Mr. Laceys recommendation. I am not comfortable, Mr. Henning said, with the U.S. attorney at a board meeting where they are considering basic corporate policy. The government is saying this is how we want this company to be operated. The government is telling Bristol-Myers and its shareholders this is how your investment will be managed. A spokesman for Mr. Christie, Michael Drewniak, said the office could live with that kind of criticism, given the history of Bristol-Myers. We have not received angry feedback from shareholders, Mr. Drewniak said. And after all, they own the company. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »When the Bristol-Myers Squibb chief executive, Peter R.

That is particularly so, he said, because both Mr. Lacey and Mr. Christie attended a meeting of the directors a week ago Monday, where Mr. Christie appeared to endorse Mr. Laceys recommendation. I am not comfortable, Mr. Henning said, with the U.S. attorney at a board meeting where they are considering basic corporate policy. The government is saying this is how we want this company to be operated. The government is telling Bristol-Myers and its shareholders this is how your investment will be managed. A spokesman for Mr. Christie, Michael Drewniak, said the office could live with that kind of criticism, given the history of Bristol-Myers. We have not received angry feedback from shareholders, Mr. Drewniak said. And after all, they own the company. 1 2Next Page »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/business/16five.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Paying the Price When Companies Stumble<date>Published: September 16, 2006</date><text>MISDEEDS and errors in judgment came back to haunt several big companies, leading to the involuntary departures of several senior corporate officers.

BOARD BATTLE Reeling from revelations that she had let the company spy on board members, Hewlett-Packards chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, agreed to resign in January. George A. Keyworth II, a director she had accused of leaking information, resigned immediately, but denied he had violated any confidences. Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive, will assume the title of chairman when Ms. Dunn steps down. The artfully calibrated agreement came after Hewlett-Packards board learned that private investigators not only misrepresented themselves to obtain phone records but had also secretly videotaped directors, according to people with knowledge of the companys examination of its private detectives activities. The California attorney generals office, which has been investigating whether the surveillance violated state laws, said criminal charges could be filed within a week. A RIVAL STUMBLES Things were hardly much better at Hewlett-Packards rival Dell. The Justice Department said it would join a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the companys accounting. The widening federal inquiry comes after Dells shares have lost about a third of their value in the last year, amid shrinking revenue, falling profit and quality-control problems that recently led to the recall of millions of laptop and notebook computers because their defective batteries could overheat and burst into flame. The companys founder and chairman, Michael S. Dell, said the company would add senior managers to help his often-criticized chief executive, Kevin B. Rollins. A C.E.O. FALLS Bristol-Myers Squibb fired its chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, amid a federal investigation of his efforts to suppress the generic version of one of the companys best-selling drugs. Bristol-Myerss board acted on the recommendation of an independent monitor who had been overseeing the company as part of the settlement of an earlier scandal involving accounting matters. While it mounts a search for a permanent successor to Mr. Dolan, the company said James M. Cornelius, a Bristol-Myers director, would serve as interim chief. Mr. Cornelius was recently interim chief executive of Guidant, the medical device maker, and was crucial to its acquisition by Boston Scientific. The latest controversy involved the blood-thinning drug Plavix, Bristol-Myerss top-selling drug, with sales in the United States of $3.5 billion last year. A challenge to the Plavix patent by Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs, is scheduled to be heard in federal court in January. DRUG TAX CASE Another pharmaceutical giant, GlaxoSmithKline, agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle the largest tax dispute in the history of the Internal Revenue Service. Under the settlement, which resolves a dispute over whether and how the federal government should tax transactions between Glaxos holding company in the United States and its foreign divisions, Glaxo also agreed not to pursue a $1.8 billion income tax refund, the I.R.S. said. Federal officials will next help to press a whistle-blower lawsuit that accuses Dey Inc., a California affiliate of the German drug maker Merck KGaA, of defrauding the Medicare program. FORD BUYOUTS The Ford Motor Company accelerated and expanded its efforts to pare its costs and return to profitability. It agreed with the United Automobile Workers union to offer cash and other incentives to persuade 75,000 American workers to quit the company. The company also announced further white-collar job cuts, as well as spending reductions and changes in its lineup of car and truck models and brands. In January, Ford unveiled its Way Forward turnaround plan, which called for 30,000 job cuts and 14 plant closings by 2012. As the companys position deteriorated  sales of its best-selling light trucks have been hurt by high gasoline prices, and Ford has lost $1.5 billion so far this year  it decided to accelerate those cuts and closings. Alan R. Mulally, a Boeing executive, will take over as Fords new chief executive on Oct. 1, succeeding William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of the companys founder, Henry Ford. SOME RELIEF Even though crude oil prices have fallen by more than $10 a barrel over the last month, OPEC ministers agreed not to reduce production, a move they might have taken to try to keep prices from falling further or faster. While energy prices remain high, they have been falling from the summer peak because of a light hurricane season so far, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, and the United Nations decision not to impose sanctions on Iran. Even at the recent peak, crude did not rise to $100 a barrel, as some traders had predicted. Still, they said oil markets remained volatile and prices could soar again if hurricanes rake the Gulf Coast, the United Nations imposes sanctions on Iran, or political violence resumes in Nigeria, a major producer. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries kept production steady this week, analysts said the OPEC ministers are starting to think about whether to cut output next year.

Dolan as chief executive of the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb ended yesterday when the board dismissed him over the mishandling of a patent dispute involving the companys blockbuster drug, Plavix. Skip to next paragraph Chip East/Reuters Peter R. Dolan Small BusinessGo to Special Section » Mr. Dolan, 50, was replaced with an interim chief, James M. Cornelius, a Bristol-Myers director. Mr. Cornelius had recently served as the interim chief executive of the medical device maker Guidant and was a crucial player in its agreement to be acquired earlier this year by Boston Scientific. Although the Bristol-Myers board said it would mount a search for a permanent chief executive, Mr. Corneliuss interim appointment increased speculation on Wall Street that the company might become an acquisition candidate. In a conference call with reporters yesterday, the chairman of Bristol-Myers, James D. Robinson III, declined to speculate on a possible sale of the company. But he said the preservation of the Plavix franchise was the companys main objective. Bristol markets Plavix in a partnership with Sanofi-Aventis of France. Plavix, used by millions of people to fight blood clots, is the companys best-selling drug, with sales in the United States of $3.5 billion last year. I can tell you that our priority No. 1 is Plavix, Plavix, Plavix, and we intend to vigorously defend our patent rights, Mr. Robinson said yesterday. A trial is scheduled for next January over a patent challenge by Apotex, the Canadian generic drug maker with which Bristol-Myers had tried to reach an out-of-court settlement this year. Missteps in those negotiations led to Apotexs undermining Bristol-Myerss Plavix franchise by flooding the market with a cheaper generic version of the drug. Although a judge subsequently ordered a stop to those shipments, the millions of dollars worth of the generic drug already on the market forced Bristol-Myers to lower its earnings forecast for this year by as much as 25 percent. Accusations that Bristol-Myers tried to hide details of the negotiations from government antitrust reviewers resulted in a Justice Department investigation that included an F.B.I. search of Mr. Dolans office in late July. Mr. Dolan was not available for comment yesterday. Mr. Robinson said that the interim chief, Mr. Cornelius, was well suited to the task because of his extensive experience in health care companies. Besides his role at Guidant, he is a former chief financial officer for the drug maker Eli Lilly &amp; Company, where he worked for 28 years. Mr. Cornelius, 62, said he was happy to serve as interim chief, but would not be a candidate for the job on a permanent basis. The boards removal of Mr. Dolan followed a meeting Monday night at the headquarters in Manhattan, convened by Mr. Robinson. With Mr. Dolan absent, a court-appointed overseer recommended that he be fired for his handling of the Plavix negotiations with Apotex. Yesterday, the company declined to provide details about the objections raised by the overseer, Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal judge. But Bristol-Myers did say that there had been no finding by Mr. Lacey that the company or its employees had broken the law. And it said that Mr. Lacey did not accuse the company of violating the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement it entered last year with the Justice Department in an unrelated accounting scandal. Mr. Lacey, who declined yesterday to discuss the matter, is monitoring the companys behavior under the terms of that Justice Department agreement, which the company entered into in the hope of avoiding a criminal indictment. Under such agreements, companies are expected to be model corporate citizens in their dealings with regulators and their disclosures to investors. And court-authorized overseers like Mr. Lacey have broad powers to monitor the companys activities. On Mr. Laceys recommendation, the board also fired Richard K. Willard, a former chief of the Justice Departments civil division who was hired as chief counsel last October. Mr. Willards role in the Plavix case is not publicly known. He could not be reached for comment yesterday. Mr. Robinson said yesterday that the board had been reviewing the companys management for weeks, hinting that Mr. Laceys recommendation merely hastened the departure of the chief executive. We gave a good deal of consideration over the past few weeks to what would be in the best interest of the company in terms of its leadership going forward and concluded that it was time for change, Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Robinson said that Mr. Dolan was not fired for cause  meaning not for wrongdoing or for neglect of his duties. That means Mr. Dolan will probably be eligible for a severance package, the details of which Mr. Robinson said had not been worked out. Shares of Bristol rose 93 cents, to $24.32 yesterday. But the shares are off nearly 60 percent since Mr. Dolan became chief executive in 2001. Speculation among financial analysts turned to the question of who might succeed Mr. Dolan, as well as a possible acquisition of the company. At 50, Mr. Dolan had expected to remain in charge of the company for years and had not groomed a successor. My sense is that theyre going to have to go outside, said Jami Rubin, a pharmaceutical analyst with Morgan Stanley. Ms. Rubin suggested that Christine Poon, the vice chairman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, who spent 15 years at Bristol-Myers, would be a strong candidate for the job. In a note to investors yesterday, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey said that Mr. Dolans ouster increased the chances of a takeover of the company, which analysts said might fetch $35 a share. Friedman, Billings noted that Mr. Cornelius, the interim chief, acted as Guidants chief during its purchase by Boston Scientific. Friedman, Billings analysts said that the most likely suitors for Bristol-Myers would be Pfizer, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline or Novartis. While declining to address takeover speculation, Mr. Robinson, the board chairman, did acknowledge that the effort to settle the patent dispute with Apotex had been a mistake. Hoping to protect the Plavix franchise until shortly before the patent expires in 2011, Bristol-Myers had twice this year reached a tentative settlement that in part would have involved paying Apotex to wait on the sidelines. As a way to bring Apotex back to the negotiating table after regulators rejected the first version of the agreement, Bristol-Myers made unusually generous concessions that would go into effect only if regulators again rejected the deal. One was the agreement not to seek triple financial damages, as would be Bristol-Myerss and Sanofis right, if Apotex started selling its drug but eventually lost the patent case in court. The other concession was to wait five days after Apotex started shipping its drug before seeking a courts injunction against those shipments. I think that in hindsight, maybe we shouldnt have negotiated in the first place, Mr. Robinson said, because we were negotiating in good faith. Im not sure that was reciprocated. That was an apparent reference to the companys claims that it was misled by Bernard C. Sherman, the chief executive of Apotex. In court, a lawyer for Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers has argued that the accusations that started the Justice Department investigation were contrived by Mr. Sherman to scuttle the settlement deal  and to begin the concessions that enabled Apotex to start shipping the generic Plavix. Mr. Sherman, in an e-mail message yesterday, called the accusation nonsensical. Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting. More Articles in Business »The troubled five-year term of Peter R.

Instead of a profit of at least $2.3 billion that the company had been expecting earlier, Bristol-Myers now expects to earn only $1.9 billion for the year. The company also said that 2007 sales of Plavix could be harmed if large enough supplies of the generic competitor from Apotex, a Canadian company, are already in wholesale channels. Apotex began marketing its drug last month in violation of an existing patent. Apotex is challenging that patent in court. A federal judge on Thursday issued an order blocking additional distribution of the generic drug and signaled that the patent was likely to be upheld at a trial next year. But Bristol-Myers’s revised earnings forecast yesterday indicated the extent of the damage the company expects from the supply of the lower-priced generic already on the market. Plavix sales in the United States amounted to $3.5 billion last year and accounted for 30 percent of Bristol-Myers’s profit. The drug is used by 48 million Americans primarily to prevent the recurrence of heart attack and stroke. Earlier in the day, the company’s partner in sales of the drug, the French company Sanofi-Aventis, announced a lowered earnings forecast for the year, predicting growth of earnings per share of 2 percent rather than the 12 percent previously announced by the company. In that statement, Sanofi said it believed that Apotex had shipped enough of the generic drug to satisfy “substantially all market demand through the end of 2006.” During stock trading yesterday, shares of both Bristol-Myers and Sanofi rose as investors responded to the judge’s ruling, which had come on Thursday after the market’s close. Bristol’s shares rose 5.5 percent yesterday, to end at $22.95. American depository receipts of Sanofi climbed nearly 1 percent, to close at $45.37. The decision by Apotex to begin selling its drug Aug. 8 followed the unraveling of a proposed agreement by the three companies to settle the patent dispute. Under that agreement, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi would have allowed Apotex early access to the Plavix market a few months before the patent expires in late 2011. That agreement, as originally drafted, did not receive clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, apparently in part because it provided for payments by the big companies to the generic maker. The attempt by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis to settle the lawsuit with Apotex has been seen as emblematic of an increasing tendency by big drug makers to settle patent challenges, rather than risk courtroom battles over their exclusive rights to market drugs. Such truces increasingly involve payments from the brand-name companies to the generic makers. In 2006, at least 6 of the 10 agreements between brand companies and generics to settle patent lawsuits have included payments from the brand maker to the generic company, accompanied by agreements to delay introduction of the generic drug. As recently as 2004, none of the 14 patent settlements by drug companies included such payments, according to statistics from the Federal Trade Commission. Some F.T.C. officials have expressed concern that such payments amount to a restraint of trade and could result in higher costs to consumers. In an interview published yesterday by The Associated Press, the chairman of the commission, Deborah Platt Majoras, said she was concerned that payments by brand- name drug makers to their generic rivals may be nothing more than payoffs to keep cheap drugs off the market, depriving consumers of low-cost medicines. Apotex, based in Toronto, filed a request yesterday with Judge Sidney H. Stein of United States District Court in Manhattan to stay his Thursday order that ended distribution of the generic, pending an appeal that the company plans to file next week. The patent trial is expected to begin in January, but Judge Stein signaled in his ruling this week that he believes that the patent is valid. The Justice Department is investigating allegations by the chief executive of Apotex, Bernard C. Sherman, that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi entered an illegal “side deal” with his company during negotiations  a deal he says was meant to be concealed from the F.T.C. and state attorneys general. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »Bristol-Myers Squibb, reeling from the incursion of a generic competitor to its top-selling drug Plavix, said yesterday evening that the impact would reduce its profits this year by at least 20 cents a share, or about $400 million.

Bristol’s shares rose 5.5 percent yesterday, to end at $22.95. American depository receipts of Sanofi climbed nearly 1 percent, to close at $45.37. The decision by Apotex to begin selling its drug Aug. 8 followed the unraveling of a proposed agreement by the three companies to settle the patent dispute. Under that agreement, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi would have allowed Apotex early access to the Plavix market a few months before the patent expires in late 2011. That agreement, as originally drafted, did not receive clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, apparently in part because it provided for payments by the big companies to the generic maker. The attempt by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis to settle the lawsuit with Apotex has been seen as emblematic of an increasing tendency by big drug makers to settle patent challenges, rather than risk courtroom battles over their exclusive rights to market drugs. Such truces increasingly involve payments from the brand-name companies to the generic makers. In 2006, at least 6 of the 10 agreements between brand companies and generics to settle patent lawsuits have included payments from the brand maker to the generic company, accompanied by agreements to delay introduction of the generic drug. As recently as 2004, none of the 14 patent settlements by drug companies included such payments, according to statistics from the Federal Trade Commission. Some F.T.C. officials have expressed concern that such payments amount to a restraint of trade and could result in higher costs to consumers. In an interview published yesterday by The Associated Press, the chairman of the commission, Deborah Platt Majoras, said she was concerned that payments by brand- name drug makers to their generic rivals may be nothing more than payoffs to keep cheap drugs off the market, depriving consumers of low-cost medicines. Apotex, based in Toronto, filed a request yesterday with Judge Sidney H. Stein of United States District Court in Manhattan to stay his Thursday order that ended distribution of the generic, pending an appeal that the company plans to file next week. The patent trial is expected to begin in January, but Judge Stein signaled in his ruling this week that he believes that the patent is valid. The Justice Department is investigating allegations by the chief executive of Apotex, Bernard C. Sherman, that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi entered an illegal “side deal” with his company during negotiations  a deal he says was meant to be concealed from the F.T.C. and state attorneys general. 1 2Next Page »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/business/01drug.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Generic of Plavix Is Blocked<date>Published: September 1, 2006</date><text>A federal judge in Manhattan ordered a Canadian company yesterday to stop distributing its generic version of the blockbuster anticlotting drug Plavix, granting a reprieve to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, which co-market the brand-name drug. Skip to next paragraph Related Preliminary Injunction (Sanofi v. Apotex) Court Opinion (pdf) The Plavix marketers had seen a drastic erosion of their United States sales since the Canadian company, Apotex, introduced its generic version on Aug. 8 in a challenge to the patent held by the big companies. Analysts say that the large supplies of the generic drug already on the market could continue to impinge on sales of Plavix for several months. While ordering Apotex to stop shipments, United States District Judge Sidney H. Stein declined a request by Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to recall the generic pills already on the market. The judge ruled that the companies had negotiated away that right in their attempts earlier this year to settle the patent dispute with Apotex. Judge Stein did say that the patent was likely to be enforceable, based on the evidence and testimony so far. He also observed that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi had suffered irreparable harm as a result of the patent infringement. He nonetheless required Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to post a $400 million bond to compensate Apotex in the event the generic company won in a trial on the validity of the patent, now set to begin in his court next January. Shares of Bristol-Myers were up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Sanofi were little changed. Bernard C. Sherman, the chief executive of Apotex, a private company based in Toronto, said yesterday that it planned to appeal. We believe that the ruling is erroneous in many respects, he said. Mr. Sherman said that the volume of the Apotex drug already on the market amounted to about three months worth of sales, while some analysts have estimated the amount at even more. A spokesman for Bristol-Myers, Tony Plohoros, said the company was trying to assess the amount of generic inventory in wholesale channels. Neither Sanofi nor Bristol-Myers had issued any other statement about the ruling, but in a letter to employees being sent last night, the Bristol-Myers chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, said it was certainly good news that the preliminary injunction has been granted, but unfortunately the economic and other consequences of the intrusion of the generic product that competes with Plavix in the U.S. market are impossible to fully reverse. A Deutsche Bank analyst, Barbara Ryan, said the ruling was relatively good news for Bristol-Myers, which derives 30 percent of its profit from sales of Plavix. The drug, used by 48 million Americans, primarily to prevent the recurrence of stroke and heart attack, had United States sales last year of $3.5 billion. But Ms. Ryan said that Mr. Dolan remained on the hot seat. She predicted that he could be replaced or that control of the company might even change, possibly before the patent trial, partly as a result of the companys mishandling of the Plavix case. I think that Peter Dolan is clearly under significant pressure, and this it not an isolated situation, Ms. Ryan said, citing shareholder displeasure over Plavix as well as several other management missteps. For Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, the ruling very likely means the company can preserve its 5.1 percent dividends, according to David S. Moskowitz, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. But the situation also seems to suggest that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi, a French company, should never have entered negotiations they began last year with Apotex, which created the opening that has allowed the generic maker to ship its product for more than three weeks. The patent covering Plavix gives market exclusivity to Bristol-Myers and Sanofi until the end of 2011. Apotex began challenging that patent in 2002, arguing that it was not valid. The case has been pending in court ever since and originally was set to go to trial in June. But the dynamic changed earlier this year, after the Food and Drug Administration approved Apotexs version of the drug. Despite that approval, under federal law Apotex would have run the risk of paying financial damages amounting to three times the generics total sales, if it brought its product to market but then eventually lost the patent case. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi began negotiations with Mr. Sherman to settle the dispute. Under an agreement reached in March, the companies granted Apotex exclusive generic rights for a six-month period that was to begin in September 2011. That settlement deal was rejected by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general who viewed it as restricting competition. It was during efforts to renegotiate the deal that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi agreed to provisions that made it easier for Apotex to market its generic immediately if the revised agreement was also turned down. Those concessions included a waiver by the big companies of their rights to collect triple Apotexs sales of the generic, as well as an agreement that they would not go to court to challenge distribution of the Apotex product until five days after it began shipment. After the second agreement was also rejected, Mr. Shermans company began shipping its product to the United States on Aug. 8. Under terms of the agreement Mr. Sherman negotiated, Apotex is liable to repay Bristol-Myers and Sanofi for only half of the generic drugs sales should Apotex lose at the patent trial. The negotiations, and accusations by Mr. Sherman that the companies entered a secret side deal, are the subject of a Justice Department investigation. In his 57-page ruling, Judge Stein wrote, The public interest in lower-priced drugs is balanced by a significant public interest in encouraging the massive investment in research and development that is required before a new drug can be developed and brought to market. More Articles in Business »A federal judge in Manhattan ordered a Canadian company yesterday to stop distributing its generic version of the blockbuster anticlotting drug Plavix, granting a reprieve to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, which co-market the brand-name drug.

Mr. Chessler said Apotex flooded the market with its product, already driving down prices. It will kill future clinical efforts, he told Judge Sidney H. Stein of United States District Court as he urged the judge to stop Apotex and force the company to recall supplies of the drug it has already sold. He accused Apotex of deliberately engaging in a plan of destroying the franchise these innovators created and creating price erosion in the market that may never recover. Robert Silver, a lawyer for Apotex, argued that better prices for drugs crucial to preventing clotting of arteries after heart surgeries was in the public interest, one of four factors the judge must consider in deciding whether to stop the introduction. The patent is invalid and unenforceable, Mr. Silver said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Court Document (pdf) Those accusations are thought to be the focus of a Justice Department investigation of Bristol-Myers and the French company Sanofi-Aventis, its marketing partner for Plavix. The filing, made in Federal District Court in Manhattan by lawyers for the Canadian generic drug maker Apotex, asserts that Bristol-Myers made the secret agreement as part of a proposed settlement with Apotex of a patent lawsuit. The secret deal, Apotex asserts, was an effort to evade the scrutiny of the federal and state regulators who were reviewing the settlement. Although the Food and Drug Administration approved Apotexs generic version of Plavix earlier this year, the settlement would have delayed the introduction of the generic drug until 2011, several months before the Plavix patent is scheduled to expire. Apotexs filing asserts that Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar, a top assistant to Bristol-Myerss chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, negotiated the secret deal after regulators objected to an earlier version of the patent settlement because it would have restricted competition. The side deal, the filing said, contained two provisions that had been in the original version of the settlement agreement but that were not included when the companies formally submitted their revised version. One provision called for Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to give Apotex a six-month head start to introduce its generic version of Plavix in 2011 before the two big companies would introduce their own generic, according to todays court filing. Under the other provision, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi would secretly give Apotex a $60 million fee that had been part of the original settlement agreement. After regulators rejected the revised settlement agreement late last month, Apotex began shipping its generic version of Plavix, known as clopidogrel bisulfate. The company has flooded the United States market with millions of pills priced 10 to 20 percent below the $4-a-day price of brand-name Plavix. Plavix, used to prevent the recurrence of heart attack and stroke, had United States sales last year of $3.5 billion and is one of Bristol-Myerss top products. Worldwide, the Plavix franchise is worth more than $6 billion. Apotex has said that it negotiated the settlement on the assumption that regulators would reject it, but conducted the discussions to win concessions from Bristol-Myers and Sanofi that have made it easier to introduce its generic drug in defiance of the big companies patent claims. It is unclear whether Apotex is a subject of the Justice Department investigation. Yesterdays filing was made ahead of a hearing scheduled for today in Federal District Court in Manhattan. There, Judge Sidney H. Stein is to consider a request by Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to block further sales of the generic drug until after a patent trial, now expected to begin in January. Tony Plohoros, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, said yesterday that an internal investigation by the companys outside lawyers had found no evidence of unlawful conduct by Bristol-Myers employees. The results of that review are being shared with the Justice Department, Mr. Plohoros said. Dr. Bodnar has declined several requests for an interview. In a hearing before Judge Stein earlier this month, a lawyer for Bristol and Sanofi asserted that Apotexs chief executive, Bernard C. Sherman, had lied to the federal government about the secret agreement to sabotage the settlement agreement and clear the way for his companys sales of the product. Mr. Sherman has denied that accusation. Apotex began challenging the Plavix patent four years ago. A trial on the merits of that patent was set to begin in June, but Bristol and Sanofi sought to avoid that trial and settle the case, fearing they might lose exclusive rights to sell the product. In March, the parties reached the initial tentative settlement that the regulators rejected. That agreements measures included permitting Apotex to begin selling its generic in September 2011, two months before the patents expiration. The parties agreed to revised terms in late May and resubmitted the agreement to state and federal authorities. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »A federal court filing provided new details yesterday about accusations that a Bristol-Myers Squibb executive entered a secret side deal with a generic drug maker in hopes of preserving the lucrative monopoly over the anticlotting drug Plavix.

One chapter will recount how an employee from a brand-name drug company offered to sell him secret files. Another, he says, will describe how Mr. Sherman caught a rival stealing the recipe for a blockbuster generic developed by his company, Apotex. But what promises to be the books most riveting chapter is still unfolding. It is the part where Mr. Sherman seemingly outsmarts two big drug companies, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, to market the first generic form of the big-selling drug Plavix five years before its patent expires. And it could conceivably end with someone in jail. They couldnt see that maybe certain things were going to end them up in prison, Mr. Sherman said last Friday during an interview in the Toronto building where his generic Plavix copy is being made. Despite his reputation as a shrewd, combative businessman, Mr. Sherman looks every bit the scientist with wiry gray hair, glasses and a pallor suggesting he rarely spends time outdoors. His white lab coat bears his nickname, Barry. The Justice Department is investigating whether Bristol-Myers and Sanofi tried to conceal from authorities part of a deal they were negotiating with Mr. Sherman to settle a lawsuit to decide the validity of their patent. That deal, subject to federal and state approval, would have preserved the companies lucrative monopoly for five more years and kept Plavix prices high. Mr. Sherman contends  and letters he mailed to Congress in July seem to support him  that he negotiated the settlement on the assumption that the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would never approve it. Mr. Sherman says he negotiated only to extract favorable concessions from Bristol-Myers and Sanofi that would take effect even without the governments approving the deal. Leveraging those concessions, Mr. Shermans company began shipping its version of Plavix in the United States last Tuesday, after government regulators did indeed reject the patent settlement. By the end of last week, Mr. Sherman said that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of his generic Plavix was on the United States market, potentially undermining the brand-name product, which had American sales of $3.5 billion last year. Apotexs generic version is selling for about 10 to 20 percent less than typical $4-a-day Plavix, which is widely used to prevent recurrences of heart attacks and strokes. Bristol-Myers announced yesterday that the company was giving rebates to its customers in an attempt to counter Apotexs generic price Bristol-Myers and Sanofi, which say they have done nothing improper, filed for an injunction against Apotex in federal court in Manhattan yesterday, seeking to block further sales of the generic drug. In an e-mail message to Bristol-Myerss 43,000 employees worldwide, the chief, Peter R. Dolan, said that if the legal steps failed to protect the Plavix patent, the generic incursion might jeopardize financing for additional clinical trials of the drug. It could also lead to potentially irreversible price decreases, customer good will impact and potential layoffs, Mr. Dolan wrote. A Lehman Brothers analyst, C. Anthony Butler, said yesterday that Bristol and Sanofi had a better than 50 percent chance of winning the court injunction. But Mr. Sherman insists that the odds are in his companys favor. In an interview at Apotexs stainless steel and glass headquarters in Toronto, Mr. Sherman declined to provide many details about the investigation, saying he expected to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington in September or October. But he hints that there are incriminating e-mail messages and maybe other documents that may be the reason federal agents searched Bristol-Myerss offices on Park Avenue in Manhattan last month. In a court hearing on Aug. 4, a lawyer for Bristol-Myers and Sanofi, Evan R. Chesler, accused Mr. Sherman of sabotaging the patent deal by giving false information to the government, which set off the criminal investigation. All I know, Mr. Sherman said, is whatever Im saying to the authorities is the truth and the whole truth. 1 2 3Next Page » More Articles in Business »The opening chapters of a draft autobiography sit amid the hundreds of pill bottles and mound of legal documents in Bernard C.

One chapter will recount how an employee from a brand-name drug company offered to sell him secret files. Another, he says, will describe how Mr. Sherman caught a rival stealing the recipe for a blockbuster generic developed by his company, Apotex. But what promises to be the books most riveting chapter is still unfolding. It is the part where Mr. Sherman seemingly outsmarts two big drug companies, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, to market the first generic form of the big-selling drug Plavix five years before its patent expires. And it could conceivably end with someone in jail. They couldnt see that maybe certain things were going to end them up in prison, Mr. Sherman said last Friday during an interview in the Toronto building where his generic Plavix copy is being made. Despite his reputation as a shrewd, combative businessman, Mr. Sherman looks every bit the scientist with wiry gray hair, glasses and a pallor suggesting he rarely spends time outdoors. His white lab coat bears his nickname, Barry. The Justice Department is investigating whether Bristol-Myers and Sanofi tried to conceal from authorities part of a deal they were negotiating with Mr. Sherman to settle a lawsuit to decide the validity of their patent. That deal, subject to federal and state approval, would have preserved the companies lucrative monopoly for five more years and kept Plavix prices high. Mr. Sherman contends  and letters he mailed to Congress in July seem to support him  that he negotiated the settlement on the assumption that the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would never approve it. Mr. Sherman says he negotiated only to extract favorable concessions from Bristol-Myers and Sanofi that would take effect even without the governments approving the deal. Leveraging those concessions, Mr. Shermans company began shipping its version of Plavix in the United States last Tuesday, after government regulators did indeed reject the patent settlement. By the end of last week, Mr. Sherman said that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of his generic Plavix was on the United States market, potentially undermining the brand-name product, which had American sales of $3.5 billion last year. Apotexs generic version is selling for about 10 to 20 percent less than typical $4-a-day Plavix, which is widely used to prevent recurrences of heart attacks and strokes.

Mr. Smith admitted that while serving on a grand jury investigating Bristol-Myers Squibb from 2004 to 2005, he leaked developments to David Pajcin and Eugene Plotkin, two former Goldman Sachs employees who have been accused of trading on the status of that investigation. I knew Pajcin and Plotkin were sharing and trading on this information, and I hoped to share in the profits, Mr. Smith told Federal Magistrate Judge Andrew J.

Though he faces a maximum of 25 years in prison for the conspiracy and insider trading charges, his plea agreement with prosecutors recommends a sentence of 30 to 37 months. The recommendation is not binding. Mr. Smith also faces civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Smith is free on bail. He is still employed as a postal worker, his lawyer, Frank Handelman, said. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Pajcin of running an insider-trading network that stretched from California to Croatia.

In their information, prosecutors said Mr. Smith invested money in the scheme. A criminal complaint filed in May also said Mr. Smith delivered $10,000 to Mr. Pajcin when he fled to Cuba last year.

Skip to next paragraph Michael Nagle/Getty Images Carl C. Icahn raised his stake in ImClone earlier this year. ImClone said that it was searching for a new chief executive, and that it had invited the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn  who in May raised his stake to more than 10 percent  to join its board. Shares of ImClone, which makes the cancer drug Erbitux, climbed as high as $43 in May, from $34 in January, as investors bet the company would be acquired. Some hoped ImClones partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, would be the buyer. Others bet on an outsider. Still others have been warning that the list of potential suitors for ImClone, whose founder Samuel D. Waksal was sentenced in 2003 for securities fraud, would probably be small. Bristol-Myers owns roughly 20 percent of ImClone. Moreover, there are several potential competitors to Erbitux, particularly a drug that is being developed by Amgen, and there are concerns that some patents protecting Erbitux could be in jeopardy. Erbitux is approved to treat colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer, and the company is hoping to win approval for the drug in lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. But some analysts believe Amgens drug, panitumumab, will eventually become the treatment of choice for colorectal cancer in patients who have failed at least two other treatments, the market now served by Erbitux. Both drugs work in a similar fashion, but panitumumab has certain safety and convenience advantages, said Keith Haan, an analyst at Summer Street Research Partners who estimates that panitumumab will ultimately gain more than 50 percent of the market held by Erbitux. Now investors are going to focus on ImClones core business, which is Erbitux, he said, and I think there are a lot of pitfalls going forward. Now, after a period of management turnover following the Waksal scandal, analysts said it appeared that the company was turning to Mr. Icahn to help provide stability. While he may be able to provide value creating ideas for the company, we dont see how he could alleviate the competitive and litigation concerns currently facing ImClone, said Cory Kasimov of Oppenheimer &amp; Company, referring to Mr. Icahn. The company said it planned to bring in another director and had asked Mr. Icahn to recommend someone. ImClones shares fell $4.32, to $28.05.

A year ago, analysts had predicted that the companies had a better than 60 percent chance of winning a patent dispute with Apotex. But an attempt by the companies to settle the dispute has backfired, opening the way for Apotex to enter the market. It looks like a much smaller generic private company completely outmaneuvered two of the giants of the pharmaceutical industry, said Gbola Amusa, European pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Its not clear how or why that happened. The reaction from investors and analysts has ranged from shock to outright anger. The generic version, called clopidogrel, is expected to be available in the United States beginning today at prices about 30 percent below the $4-a-day retail price for Plavix. The drug, used for preventing heart attacks and strokes, had sales of more than $6 billion last year. Shares of Bristol-Myers, which gets nearly one-fifth of its revenue from Plavix, were down 6.85 percent yesterday on the prospect of a major erosion of those sales. The American depository receipts of Sanofi, a French company that sells Plavix outside the United States, were off by nearly 1 percent. Barry Sherman, Apotexs chief executive, predicted that clopidogrel, the biggest-selling drug ever to go generic, would mark the largest and most successful launch of a generic drug in history. Apotexs move into the market follows the governments recent rejection of the proposed patent settlement, which Bristol-Myers and Sanofi had hoped would keep the generic drug off the market until 2011. Despite the governments rejection of the deal, some terms of that agreement remain in effect. And they hold at least two significant disadvantages for Bristol and Sanofi. Under the terms, the companies must wait five business days before seeking a federal injunction against Apotexs shipments, giving the generic company an opportunity to potentially flood the market with its generic drug before a court can step in. The big companies also negotiated away their rights under federal law to seek triple financial damages if they eventually win the patent dispute in court. That proviso removed one of the major deterrents to a generic competitors entering the market while a drug is still under patent. Analysts said the developments raised doubts about the leadership of Bristol-Myers and Sanofi and the wisdom of the concessions they had made to Apotex. And because the abortive patent settlement is also now the subject of a federal criminal inquiry, some analysts raised questions about whether Peter R. Dolan, Bristol-Myerss chief executive, can survive. On the surface, it doesnt look good, said Jami Rubin, a Morgan Stanley analyst. Credibility, I think, has been severely set back. In a letter to employees yesterday, Mr. Dolan warned that there would be negative news accounts of the generic introduction, but he defended the companys efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. A Bristol-Myers spokesman, Tony Plohoros, said the company was evaluating its legal and commercial options. Those could include a decision by the company to drastically lower the price of Plavix or to introduce its own generic equivalent. In a statement, the French company Sanofi said it was also evaluating possible remedies against Apotex, which a lawyer for Bristol-Myers accused in court of intentionally sabotaging the deal. Mr. Sherman, in a telephone interview, all but ridiculed his two big rivals, saying they had naïvely agreed to conditions that allowed his company to bring its product to market even though the deal was rejected by regulators. I think they acted foolishly in a number of ways, said Mr. Sherman, a Toronto billionaire who amassed his fortune in the generic drug business. Mr. Sherman said that he had never expected the American government to approve the deal, but that he had conducted the negotiations in a way to let him push the Apotex drug onto the market. Mr. Sherman said Apotex was engaged in an all-out launch and has already shipped most of its inventory while manufacturing continues. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »The generic drug maker Apotex yesterday began shipping a cheaper form of Plavix, the anticlotting agent that is one of the worlds best-selling drugs, in an embarrassing setback for the drugs brand-name marketers, Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

The prediction by David B. Snow, the chief executive of Medco Health Solutions, seemed to confirm the likelihood that the Canadian drug maker Apotex plans to roll out its generic copy of Plavix soon in an aggressive challenge to the drugs patent. The patent challenge is already the subject of a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan. And state officials last week rejected a proposed settlement between Apotex and the two big drug makers that had been intended to resolve the matter by delaying the introduction of a Plavix competitor until 2011. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi have previously told investors that losing the exclusive right to sell Plavix would have a significant financial impact on the companies. The drugs worldwide sales were $6.3 billion last year. Apotex officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Bristol-Myers vowed to fight any challenge to the Plavix patent, while Sanofi declined to comment. Mr. Snow made the remarks during his companys second-quarter earnings call with investment analysts. Mr. Snow said Medco, which administers drug benefit plans for employers, was raising its earnings forecast for the year based on the increased availability of several generics. The company is forecasting that the generic form of Plavix, a blockbuster drug with spending of $2.7 billion in the United States, will become available in 2006, Mr. Snow said, a forecast that sent shares of Bristol-Myers and Sanofi tumbling. Another company official said the generic drug could ship soon. Bristol-Myerss stock, which was off by nearly 6 percent after his remarks, recovered somewhat but still ended the days trading down 4.4 percent, closing at $22.75. The American depository receipts of Sanofi, which is based in France, ended at $45.15, down 3.8 percent. Medco, whose own shares were up 2.2 percent on a strong second-quarter report and its earnings outlook, said it based the Plavix forecast on market chatter, but did not disclose the source of its information. Companies like Medco are frequently in contact with generic drug makers because of the large volume of drugs they supply through employee benefit programs. Another similar company, Express Scripts, raised its earnings forecast last week, also citing the unexpected entrance of new generics, but did not specify what those drugs might be. The availability of generic Plavix could be good news for thousands of people who take the drug, particularly those who pay retail. Plavix sells for about $4 a day. The generic version would very likely be 30 percent cheaper. The drug is normally used by heart attack and stroke victims to prevent a recurrence. Apotex was known to have begun manufacturing a generic form of Plavix early this year after gaining Food and Drug Administration approval in January, despite the existence of the United States patent. The validity of that patent is the subject of a lawsuit involving the three companies in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The companies had tentatively settled that lawsuit in March, but the settlement was rejected last week by a coalition of state attorneys general. The day before that announcement, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi had said that the settlement, which involved a cash payment to Apotex, had also become the subject of a Justice Department criminal investigation. A decision by Apotex to begin marketing the drug while the patent is still in force would be a move known in the industry as an at-risk launch. It means Apotex could be responsible for repaying the brand-name companies three times their sales losses if they end up successfully defending their patent in court. Such a risky move, though, would not be out of character for Apotex, which is based near Toronto. The company and its owner, Barry Sherman, are known for aggressively taking on brand-name pharmaceutical companies through marketing and litigation. Jeffrey MacDonald, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, said in a statement that his company and Sanofi believed their patent had been infringed and planned to fight vigorously to defend it.

An experienced warrior who has battled both government investigations and investor lawsuits aimed at his company, as well as setbacks from the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Dolan is regarded as cool under fire. Mr. Dolans aplomb is being challenged by yet another investigation, just as the company appeared to have resolved its problems. He has clearly been at the helm through a lot of the difficult phase that his company has faced, said Chris Shibutani, an analyst for J.

Robinson III, voiced continued support for Mr. Dolan. Peter has done a superb job in turning around the company, from developing a new management team, to a pipeline considered to be one of the best in the industry, to the recent approvals which bring innovative new medicines to patients in need, Mr. Robinsons statement said. He has the full and complete confidence of the board. We believe the actions of all Bristol-Myers Squibb employees, including Peter, involved in this matter have been appropriate, and have been coordinated hand-in-hand with senior outside counsel at every step. The matter to which Mr. Robinson referred is a federal criminal inquiry into a proposed patent settlement involving the companys biggest-selling product, the blood-thinning medication Plavix. Bristol-Myers markets the drug with the French company Sanofi-Aventis. Yesterday, a coalition of 56 state and territorial attorneys general rejected a proposed settlement, which was supposed to have ended the patent dispute with Apotex, a Canadian company that wants to market a generic copy of Plavix. Among the options now, the companies could renegotiate the deal and seek approval again or take the patent dispute to trial. Before the settlement was announced, such a trial had originally been planned for last month. In light of the criminal investigation, the rejection had been expected. But Apotex is owed its $40 million, regardless, under terms of the deal. The company said Mr. Dolan and other Bristol-Myers executives and board members, including Mr. Robinson, were not available for interviews yesterday to discuss the investigation. The type of settlement Bristol-Myers and Sanofi had proposed with Apotex was of a sort  in which big pharmaceutical companies make payments to generic companies as part of agreements that delay the sale of the generic drug  that is coming under increasing scrutiny, with critics saying they stifle competition. Still, financial analysts and antitrust experts said yesterday that it was unlikely that such a settlement would generate a criminal inquiry absent extenuating circumstances. They speculated that the investigation involved accusations either that the companies had misled the government about terms of the deal or had engaged in a bad faith settlement in an effort to simply delay a trial on the patent dispute. Any delay benefits the patent holders, who are scheduled to lose exclusivity, anyway, in 2012. Critics of the companys management and board have said that the latest criminal investigation indicates that the corporate culture of Bristol-Myers has not changed since it was accused of a practice called channel stuffing that involves inflating sales through inventory manipulation, forcing Mr. Dolan to restate earnings by $2.5 billion for the period 1999 to 2001. Thomas Dubbs, a Manhattan lawyer who sued the company over an aborted drug called Vanlev, called the newest investigation, yet another example of the Bristol-Myers board apparently being asleep at the switch. One would think that after channel stuffing and the Vanlev debacles, Mr. Dubbs said, they would be paying more attention to whether senior management is playing by the rules. The lawsuit by Mr. Dubbs, which the company settled this year for $185 million, contended that Bristol-Myers made unduly rosy statements about Vanlev, a drug for high blood pressure, stirring investor interest in the company even though officials knew it caused a dangerous swelling condition called angioedema. Mr. Dolan, who had been an executive of Bristol, took over as its chief in 2001, after the Vanlev debacle and on the tail end of the channel stuffing problems. He has said he was not aware of the channel stuffing practice until he unearthed evidence of it, then took corrective action. The company hoped it had put the inventory issues behind it when that case ended in June 2005 with an agreement by the company to make a $300 million payment to a shareholder-restitution fund, part of $839 million in total settlement and restitution payments made in connection with the channel stuffing accusations. The payment was part of an unusual deferred prosecution agreement that meant Bristol-Myers would not be prosecuted criminally if the company remained an exemplary corporate citizen until June 2007. It is not yet clear whether the new investigation could jeopardize the companys standing under last years agreement. Despite all the bad news, shares in Bristol-Myers yesterday regained some of the heavy losses of Thursday, closing up 43 cents at $24.47. The stock had closed at $25.99 Wednesday, before the company disclosed the criminal investigation. Analysts also said that Bristol-Myers core business is looking stronger into 2007 and 2008  years when Mr. Dolan has said he will return the company to sustained sales and earnings growth. Dr. Shibutani, the analyst, called the recent developments at Bristol-Myers disappointing in light of the recent positive momentum at the company. Theres a tragedy in a sense that this company is on the cusp of turning around its operations, said Dr. Shibutani, a medical doctor, who is enthusiastic about the Bristol-Myers pipeline for what he called real scientific advances and legitimate potential blockbuster products. More Articles in Business »A day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched his office, Peter R.

Skip to next paragraph JB Reed/Bloomberg News Plavix, a blood thinner, is used to reduce the risk of heart attacks. The investigation, a criminal inquiry into the drug companies, Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb, was announced yesterday. It could signal a federal crackdown on increasingly common payments by the pharmaceutical industry to stave off competition from low-cost generics. As part of the inquiry, federal agents, armed with subpoenas, searched two offices Wednesday at the headquarters of Bristol-Myers on Park Avenue in Manhattan, including the office of the chief executive, Peter R. Dolan. Shares of both companies plummeted on yesterdays news. In a conference call with investment analysts, in which news of the investigation seemed to magnify the financial challenges evident in his companys lackluster second-quarter results, Mr. Dolan said that there was nothing illegal about the agreement and that the company was cooperating with the investigation. The generic medicine was expected to cost only a fraction of the $4 a day for Plavix, which is widely used to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Plavix had sales of $6.2 billion last year and is by far the best-selling drug for Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York. Sanofi, which is based in France and jointly markets Plavix with Bristol, issued a statement announcing the investigation, but declined to comment further. The federal investigation involves an agreement that the two companies reached earlier this year with Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs, after Apotex indicated it was planning to market its version of the drug, which had been approved in January by the Food and Drug Administration. Initially, Sanofi and Bristol had sued to block Apotexs version on the ground that it violated their patent, and a trial had been scheduled to begin last month in New York. But the companies announced in March that the patent lawsuit had been settled under terms that would have involved a payment to Apotex and an agreement that the company not sell its generic version until September 2011, eight months before the United States patent for Plavix was set to expire. The agreement raised very serious competitive concerns, said David A. Balto, a lawyer and a former policy director for the Federal Trade Commission. Generic drugs are priced 30 percent, at least, below branded drugs and the potential savings to consumers would be something like $1 billion a year. Payments to settle pharmaceutical patent lawsuits can potentially delay the sale of generic drugs. They have recently attracted scrutiny both from the F.T.C. and Congress, where legislation to restrict such deals is under consideration. Critics say the agreements could make it more lucrative for generic makers to collect money not to market their products than to actually sell them, a trend that could potentially increase the overall price of drugs. The F.T.C. recently issued a report documenting a rise in the number of patent settlements in which the brand-name manufacturers paid generic makers not to market their generics. In one example, the agency contended that Warner Chilcott, maker of the Ovcon birth control pill, paid $20 million to Barr Laboratories to delay the sale of a generic version. In Senate testimony last week, Jon Leibowitz, an F.T.C. commissioner, said that such settlements could stifle competition. In a note to investors yesterday the investment firm CIBC World Markets said the Plavix settlement appeared to have been the most aggressive of the agreements, characterizing it as a pay not to play deal. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi never gave specific details on the amount they were paying to Apotex, but Bristol announced it had set aside $40 million in the first quarter to cover the minimum amount of that payment. The companies revised the agreement in June after questions from the F.T.C. and state attorneys general, agreeing to let Apotex sell the drug beginning in June 2011, rather than September of that year. The revised agreement requires approval by the F.T.C. and states, which had been expected to rule as early as today. It was unclear yesterday what effect the Justice Department inquiry might have on the F.T.C.-state review. Under its rules, the F.T.C. is obliged to forward evidence of any criminal activity it suspects to the Department of Justice, whose antitrust division has responsibility for criminal antitrust prosecutions. And there was speculation yesterday that the F.T.C. review had led to the Justice Department inquiry. Without the settlement, Apotex had a significant chance of losing the patent lawsuit and would not have been able to market its drug until 2012. The two large companies had already prevailed in a patent case in Canada. Ahead of the United States trial, some investment analysts had given Apotex no more than a 40 percent chance of winning. Apotex had run a risk in going after the generic Plavix market by seeking the F.D.A.s clearance to sell its version. Such generic approvals are allowed while patents are still in force. But companies that market drugs in violation of anothers patent are legally subject to treble damages if they lose patent lawsuits, a deterrent to the marketing of generic drugs while patents are still in force. C. Anthony Butler, an analyst for Lehman Brothers who covers Bristol, said the investigations impact on Sanofi and Bristol was uncertain, although it might result in their resuming the patent suit against Apotex. Im not clear that its a major setback, he said. It does scare investors. Criminal investigation is a negative phrase. The criminal inquiry is a psychological setback for Bristol and its chief, Mr. Dolan, who had hoped the resolution of the Plavix patent dispute would signify the end of a five-year period in which the company was the target of investor lawsuits and a criminal investigation involving its inventory practices. Bristol is currently on a sort of federal probationary status as a result of the settlement of that case, in which former company officials were accused of lying to investors about a practice called channel-stuffing that inflated sales numbers. In the case of the Apotex agreement, the review by the F.T.C. and states was required under a consent decree Bristol signed in 2003 after the company was accused of using patent filings to thwart generic rivals for two of its drugs: the cancer treatment Taxol and the anti-anxiety drug BuSpar. The company announced lackluster second-quarter financial results yesterday that showed Plavix, which accounted for $3.8 billion of revenue at the company last year, has been one of Bristols growth products during the period. The company said it earned 35 cents a share for the second quarter, on revenue of $4.87 billion, compared with 47 cents a share on revenue of $4.89 billion in the quarter last year. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Bristol-Myers fell $1.95, or 7.5 percent, to $24.04. American depository receipts of Sanofi-Aventis closed at $47.16, down $2.84, or 5.7 percent.

And analysts expect the benefits to show up in many of the quarterly financial results that drug makers will begin posting this week. The windfall, which by some estimates could be $2 billion or more this year, is a result of the transfer of millions of low-income people into the new Medicare Part D drug program that went into effect in January. Under that program, as it turns out, the prices paid by insurers, and eventually the taxpayer, for the medications given to those transferred are likely to be higher than what was paid under the federal-state Medicaid programs for the poor. About 6.5 million low-income elderly people or younger disabled poor people were automatically transferred into the Part D program for drug coverage. Because their other health needs are still covered by Medicaid, they are called dual eligibles. The advent of Part D has not affected the drug coverage for the 45 million other low-income people whose drugs are still paid for under state Medicaid programs. Those programs closely monitor drug prices, and drug makers often typically end up paying rebates to the states. It is too early to calculate the full effect of the shift of the former Medicaid patients now covered by Part D. But analysts expect it to generate hundreds of millions of additional dollars this year for the drug companies, which have long chafed under the pricing restraints of the state programs. Drugs tend to be cheaper under the Medicaid programs because the states are the buyers and by law they receive the lowest available prices for drugs. But in creating the federal Part D program, Congress  in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry  barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers. Since Part D went into effect, the pharmaceutical industry has raised the wholesale prices of its brand-name drugs an average of 3.6 percent. Although the actual amount spent depends on what each insurer negotiates, in many cases the drugs for those 6.5 million people who used to receive their medicines through Medicaid will cost more now. Initially, the added costs will be paid by the insurers administering the new Medicare drug program. But when it comes time for the insurers to settle accounts with the government, the costs of the 6.5 million drugs for the transferees will end up being passed along to federal taxpayers, according to analysts and health care economists. The windfall for the drug makers was made possible by a provision of the 2003 Medicare law that exempts Part D drugs from “best price” rebates that the drug makers have been required to give to the state Medicaid programs since 1991. Those rebates are meant to make sure that state Medicaid agencies pay no more than the best prices drug companies offer to any big commercial insurer. Under Medicaid, the federal government and state agencies paid more than $14 billion annually for the drugs of the 6.5 million transferees. Without the best-price rebates, the cost would have been 25 percent higher, or about $17.5 billion, said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota. Nobody yet knows what the total drug bill will be for these people under Part D, beyond the assumption by many experts that it will be higher. Medicare will not have solid numbers until it can analyze the hundreds of monthly reports that the plans in the Part D system are required to file. Yet, one indicator of the higher revenue from dual-eligibles has already been seen in reports by drug companies this year showing double-digit United States sales increases of certain drugs that are heavily used by Medicaid patients. For example, sales of Lamictal, an antipsychosis drug from GlaxoSmithKline, were up 33 percent, to $305 million in the first quarter; sales of Seroquel, an antipsychotic from AstraZeneca, were up 29 percent, to $590 million; and sales of Plavix, a blood thinner from Bristol-Myers Squibb, were up 26 percent, to $850 million. Timothy Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst with the Prudential Equity Group, estimates that if Part D were not in place the rebates for the makers for all of 2006 would have been more than $2 billion for 13 drugs widely used by the people transferred from Medicaid to Part D. Dr. Anderson estimates that because the companies will not have to pay those rebates under Part D, revenue to Glaxo from Lamictal will increase by $298 million this year, AstraZeneca’s Seroquel sales will rise by $521 million, and Plavix revenue will increase $169 million. Estimates on the rebate increases because of Part D are few, but all are in general agreement on the size of the rebate to drug makers. Medicaid programs have been especially important for drugs like Seroquel and Lamictal, which are prescribed for bipolar disorder and other mental health problems 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »The pharmaceutical industry is beginning to reap a windfall from a surprisingly lucrative niche market: drugs for poor people.

Medicaid programs have been especially important for drugs like Seroquel and Lamictal, which are prescribed for bipolar disorder and other mental health problems 1 2Next Page »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/13/business/13drug.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">F.D.A. Backs AIDS Pill to Be Taken Once a Day<date>Published: July 13, 2006</date><text>The first drug that allows AIDS to be treated by taking one pill a day won federal approval yesterday, a development that government officials said would both simplify and improve treatment of the disease. The drug, called Atripla, is a combination of three once-a-day drugs that are already on the market  Sustiva from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Viread and Emtriva from Gilead Sciences. Only a decade ago, when cocktails of AIDS drugs began to be used, patients sometimes had to take two dozen or more pills a day. Atripla, which will be available this week or next, will have a wholesale price of $1,150 a month, equal to the sum of the prices of its components, James Loduca, a spokesman for Gilead, said. Both Gilead and Bristol-Myers will market the drug. The approval by the Food and Drug Administration yesterday, which was expected, came well before the October deadline for the agency to act. F.D.A. officials said they moved quickly because a once-a-day treatment would help people take their medicines faithfully. That would prevent the AIDS virus from gaining resistance to the drugs. “It’s one thing to have medicine available, but it will only be effective when people can indeed take it as they are supposed to,” Dr. Murray M. Lumpkin, an F.D.A. deputy commissioner, said at a news conference in Washington. Dr. Lumpkin said a once-a-day treatment would be particularly important for developing countries, where access to health care is more limited. Yet no announcement was made yesterday about when the drug would be available overseas and for what price. An agreement must first be reached with Merck &amp; Company, which sells Sustiva, also known as efavirenz, in developing countries under the name Stocrin. Jeffrey Sturchio, vice president for external affairs at Merck, said his company had “reached agreement on all the issues with Gilead.” He said it was now a matter of formalizing the agreement and then applying for approval in various countries. He predicted that Atripla would be available in some poor countries in the next several months at a price that would be roughly the sum of the heavily discounted prices at which the component drugs are now sold in those places. Gilead, based in Foster City, Calif., has become one of the most successful biotechnology companies, based on its AIDS drugs, which accounted for $1.4 billion of its $2 billion in revenue last year. One of its big sellers is Truvada, a once-a-day combination of Viread, also known as tenofovir, and Emtriva, also known as emtricitabine. Truvada is usually taken with another drug, like Bristol-Myers’s Sustiva. Yaron Werber, an analyst at Citigroup, which counts Gilead as a client, said that adding the Bristol-Myers drug into a three-drug combination pill would allow Gilead to take market share from GlaxoSmithKline, which sells a popular two-drug combination called Combivir. “I think the drug will do exceptionally well,” Mr. Werber said of Atripla. “The drug is now the most convenient on the market and it’s probably also the most potent.” More Articles in Business »The first drug that allows AIDS to be treated by taking one pill a day won federal approval yesterday, a development that government officials said would both simplify and improve treatment of the disease.

A revised settlement, which is under review, would keep a generic version of Plavix, the world's second-biggest drug behind Lipitor from Pfizer, off the market until June 1, 2011, Bristol-Myers said in a statement. The companies' original offer would have set the licensing date at Sept. 17, 2011, at which time Apotex would pay a royalty to distribute the generic drug. Bristol-Myers said, "There is no assurance that the revised agreement will address all of the concerns of the F.T.C. and state attorneys general, and there remains a significant risk that antitrust clearance will not be obtained." Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apotex, a generic drug maker based in Weston, Ontario, in 2002 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Bristol-Myers is under a 10-year court order until 2013 to get approval from the states when it enters into an agreement to settle a patent infringement case. The company was accused of using patents to thwart low-cost rivals for the cancer medicine Taxol and antianxiety drug BuSpar. If the F.T.C. and state attorneys general fail to sign off on a settlement over Plavix, the case will go to trial. Plavix, jointly marketed by Bristol-Myers and Sanofi, generates $6.2 billion a year as a treatment for patients in the midst of a heart attack or undergoing artery-clearing procedures. The drug, a $4-a-day pill that prevents the formation of blood clots, is the biggest product for the two pharmaceutical companies.

Now, one of the largest insider trading scandals in decades has taken another unlikely turn  into the grand jury room. Skip to next paragraph Cary Conover for The New York Times Jason Smith, a postal worker, was charged with leaking information from a grand jury that was investigating Bristol-Myers Squibb. A postal worker, Jason C. Smith of Jersey City, was arrested yesterday and charged with leaking secret information from grand jury proceedings to David Pajcin and Eugene Plotkin, the two men previously accused of running an insider trading ring that reaped $6.7 million in illegal profits in 2004 and 2005. Mr. Smith, 29, served on a federal grand jury investigating possible accounting fraud at Bristol-Myers Squibb, and federal prosecutors said he arranged to call Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin from the courthouse so they could make profitable trades on the secret grand jury proceedings. In yet a further odd twist, they were unable to profit on the tip, according to the complaints against Mr. Smith, because his information proved faulty. The arrest introduces a new spin to one of the oldest crimes on Wall Street, investigators said. Mark K. Schonfeld, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Northeast regional director, said that Mr. Smith was the first person in an insider trading case to be accused of leaking grand jury testimony. The scheme "not only corrupted securities markets but struck at the heart of our judicial system," Mr. Schonfeld said. Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference yesterday that having an inside informant on a grand jury showed grave contempt for the law. Mr. Smith, who is a letter carrier in Jersey City and who was a high school friend of Mr. Pajcin, was arrested at his home at 6 a.m. yesterday. He faces charges of insider trading and criminal contempt for breaking his grand jury oath of secrecy. The Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint in the case to add Mr. Smith as the 14th defendant. He was being held yesterday after bail was set at $3 million. Yesterday's arrest is just the latest development in a case that seems to get more bizarre with each new charge. Prosecutors say that through accounts in the names of the dancer, who was Mr. Pajcin's girlfriend, and his aunt in Croatia, Mr. Pajcin and other defendants sought to trade on insider information from a variety of sources. Their trades involved companies like Reebok, whose acquisition in 2005 by Adidas Salomon netted the ring more than $2 million through call options bought shortly before the deal closed. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan described Mr. Smith as the third source of inside tips for Mr. Plotkin's and Mr. Pajcin's scheme. Charges of feeding the two information have already been filed against Stanislav Shpigelman, a former Merrill Lynch analyst, and Juan Renteria and Nickolaus Shuster, who were both employees of a BusinessWeek printing plant in Wisconsin. Mr. Pajcin has been cooperating with federal authorities. Mr. Smith was a grand juror in Newark in late 2003 in a case examining whether Bristol-Myers Squibb was inflating its profits by inducing wholesalers to buy more drugs than they needed, a practice known as channel stuffing. Mr. Smith contacted Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin in late 2004 or early 2005, and the three discussed sharing in profits from trading in Bristol-Myers shares, according to the criminal complaint. Mr. Smith told Mr. Pajcin that a high-ranking Bristol-Myers executive testified multiple times before the grand jury, and that prompted Mr. Pajcin to sell short 2,000 shares of Bristol-Myers through the trading account of his aunt, Sonja Anticevic, the seamstress. A short sale is essentially a bet that a stock will fall. Mr. Pajcin also tipped two others, not named in the complaint, who also sold the stock short, prosecutors said. But the executive was not indicted when the grand jury handed up its decision on June 14, 2005. Mr. Pajcin and the other traders closed out their short positions a day before the results of the investigation were made public, prosecutors contend. If convicted on two charges of securities fraud and one charge of conspiracy, Mr. Smith would face as much as 45 years in prison. Mr. Smith also faces a contempt of court charge from federal prosecutors in New Jersey. Mr. Smith's lawyer, Frank Handelman, said, "I'm glad bail was set, and I hope he gets out soon." Mr. Smith may have been involved in the insider trading scheme in other ways. Prosecutors say they have a copy of a check for $7,000 that Mr. Smith made out to Mr. Pajcin to help finance the insider trading activity. After the S.E.C. began investigating Mr. Pajcin's trades, Mr. Pajcin fled to Cuba. According to the complaint, Mr. Smith met him there and delivered about $10,000 from Mr. Plotkin. Prosecutors said that Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin went to Mr. Smith's home and destroyed the laptop computers, hard drives and cellphones used in executing their trades. They said that in a recorded phone call on April 12, a day after prosecutors arrested Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Shpigelman, Mr. Pajcin, who has been in custody for months, told Mr. Smith that he was considering cooperating with regulators and advised him that he might tell the regulators about "the jury thing."

The agreement, with a Canadian maker of generic drugs, would protect the companies' exclusive right to market the drug until 2011, eliminating a major uncertainty for investors. The settlement, with Apotex, of Canada, calls for the companies to pay an undisclosed amount to Apotex and also allows the generic company to sell its version of Plavix beginning in September 2011, eight months before the United States patent is expected to expire. The companies said they would split the payments to Apotex 50-50, adding that they expected to establish reserves this quarter for the minimum estimated amount of the payment. Under the agreement, Apotex will make undisclosed royalty payments to the companies beginning in 2011. The settlement, which needs approval by the Federal Trade Commission, was considered a positive development for both Sanofi-Aventis, a French company, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is based in New York. In after-hours trading, shares of Bristol-Myers climbed $1.92, to $24.75. American depository receipts of Sanofi-Aventis were up $2.92, to $46.60 in after-hours trades. Sanofi-Aventis makes Plavix, but under its co-marketing agreement Bristol-Myers's share of Plavix sales were $3.8 billion in 2005, making it the American company's largest product by far. A Canadian court last year ruled against Apotex's claim that the fundamental patent on Plavix had expired in 2003. But because of differences in American patent law, that case was not seen as predictive of how the dispute might be resolved in this country. The United States patent lawsuit had been set to go to trial in June in federal court in Manhattan, and some analysts had estimated the chances as high as 40 percent that Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers could lose their exclusive right to market the drug, which had global sales last year of $6.2 billion, second only to the cholesterol treatment Lipitor, which is made by Pfizer. Both Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers had said that losing the patent could have materially affected their financial strength and liquidity. Although Apotex was considered the major litigant opposing the two companies, they said in a joint statement that they had also approached another company involved in the patent litigation, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories of Hyderabad, India, to discuss a settlement. Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers sued Apotex and Dr. Reddy's in 2002 after they each filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration to market generic Plavix, known as clopidogrel bisulfate, in the United States. After the suit was filed, the F.D.A stayed action on the generic application for 30 months. The stay expired last May, and the F.D.A. approved Apotex's application in January. If the company had marketed the product before the lawsuit's end, however, it would have been subject to treble damages if it later lost the patent case. The companies said yesterday that they would also approach two other generic companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals of Israel and Cobalt Pharmaceuticals of Canada, which had sought to market generic Plavix in this country as well. If approved, the settlement would remove the last major impediment that has hindered Bristol-Myers Squibb during the last five years. During that period the company had also been the target of investor lawsuits and a criminal investigation involving its inventory practices  cases that have since been settled. Peter R. Dolan, chief executive of Bristol-Myers, has said he will return the company to sales and earnings growth in 2007 with a positive Plavix outcome. Mr. Dolan was not available for comment yesterday.

Mr. Dolan was not available for comment yesterday.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/02/business/02bristol.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Study Finds Risk in Bristol-Myers Drug<date>Published: March 2, 2006</date><text>Tequin, an antibiotic from the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, can have life-threatening side effects including dangerous blood sugar abnormalities, according to a Canadian study that urged doctors to stop prescribing it.

As uncertainties seemed to mount, Bristol-Myers also predicted lower sales and earnings for 2006, with generic competition and patent losses significantly weighing down sales. Some analysts have said that the company's has a significant chance of losing a patent battle for the blood thinner Plavix, which accounts for about 20 percent of Bristol-Myers's revenue. A trial to defend that patent on that product, which the company markets with Sanofi-Aventis, is scheduled for April 3. The Food and Drug Administration issued a license to the Canadian generic manufacturer Apotex this week to market a copycat version of Plavix, a development that the chief executive of Bristol-Myers, Peter R. Dolan, said had been expected. Also this week, a Bristol-Myers business partner, ImClone Systems, hired an investment bank to explore a possible sale; a rival to ImClone's cancer drug, Erbitux, is expected to receive F.D.A. approval. Bristol-Myers owns nearly 20 percent of ImClone, but executives would not speculate whether Bristol-Myers was interested in acquiring the company or how the purchase of ImClone by a rival would affect operations. Mr. Dolan repeated the promise that 2007 would mark a return to sustainable earnings and sales growth, citing the company's new rheumatoid arthritis treatment, Orencia, expected to be released within the next six weeks, as well as strong growth in several other products. The company, Mr. Dolan said, also has high hopes for its new leukemia medication, dasatinib. The company has completed a submission to the F.D.A. for approval of that product. The company's third-largest product is not a pharmaceutical  it is Enfamil baby formula. Mr. Dolan said sales of Enfamil, sold by the company's Mead Johnson unit, grew 11 percent in the fourth quarter and 15 percent for the year, reaching nearly $1 billion. Bristol-Myers is looking to trim about $500 million in costs during 2007. Once again, executives hinted at reductions in its primary care sales force after the F.D.A. did not approve the company's diabetes medication, Pargluva, because of safety concerns. Officials declined to specify how many of the company's sales force of 2,700 would be laid off, should the company decide to do that. The company, based in New York, said net income for the fourth quarter more than tripled to $499 million, or 26 cents a share, but that was largely because of lower tax costs. For the year, the company reported earnings of $3 billion, or $1.52 a share, an increase from 2004 earnings of $2.39 billion, or $1.21 a share. The company said earnings for 2006 would drop to $1.15 to $1.25 a share. Full-year sales, $19.2 billion in 2005, will be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion lower in 2006 because of patent losses and increasing competition.

The lawsuit by shareholders, filed in United States District Court for New Jersey in 2000, contended that company executives and consultants described the drug, Vanlev, as a potential blockbuster despite the side effect of angioedema, a swelling that could interfere with breathing. The suit also argued that Vanlev had few benefits over existing drugs. Bristol-Myers knew of the problem as early as 1996, the plaintiffs said, but continued to make positive statements about its sales potential. In April 2000, the company announced that it was withdrawing its application for approval from the Food and Drug Administration because of angioedema. In July 2000, Bristol-Myers said it would test Vanlev at lower doses where the problem of angioedema did not appear to be as severe. The suit contended that there were still problems at the lower doses, and that the drug maker did not announce this until March 2002. Shares of Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, fell 23 cents yesterday, to $22.10.

The infusion treatment, intended for moderate to severe cases of the disease, is a novel biologic agent that works by modulating a signal required to activate T-cells, a factor in rheumatoid arthritis inflammation. Several analysts have said they expect Orencia to achieve blockbuster status. Orencia will compete with Enbrel by Amgen, Remicade by Johnson &amp; Johnson and Humira by Abbott - all called anti-TNF agents. Clinical tests showed that Orencia worked in a significant number of patients who did not respond to anti-TNF agents or another commonly used drug, methotrexate. Of about two million rheumatoid arthritis patients nationwide, an estimated 250,000 are on anti-TNF therapy. Of those, 15 percent to 25 percent result in treatment failures or an inadequate response, according to an analyst report by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Company, which predicts Orencia sales of $1.02 billion by 2008. "We believe that this group of non-responders could be a natural target for Bristol," the investment advisers said in a report Dec. 13, adding that patients who do not respond to methotrexate are another likely target for the drug. The approval by Food and Drug Administration yesterday followed a unanimous advisory committee vote for the product in September. In October, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback when the F.D.A. delayed approval of another first-in-class treatment developed by the company, an oral diabetes medication called Pargluva. Bristol-Myers, based in New York, has said it may abandon Pargluva as a result of cardiovascular safety concerns. The company announced Thursday that it had terminated an agreement to market Pargluva jointly with Merck. At a meeting this month with investors, the Bristol-Myers senior vice president for global clinical development, Dr. Brian Daniels, said the company believed that Orencia might be proved useful in other autoimmune disorders, including lupus, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Bristol-Myers Squibb said it hoped to begin marketing Orencia in February using a special sales force, many with experience in rheumatoid arthritis. Initial manufacturing of Orencia is expected to take place in the company's plant in Syracuse. Orencia is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion administered monthly.

One of them is Walter Bach of Glendale, Queens. Mr. Bach, 65, who is blind, received worrisome news last month from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The free Plavix he gets from the company's charitable foundation will stop if he enrolls in the new Medicare prescription program that begins in January. Mr. Bach says that his free Plavix, a $125-a-month blood thinner that reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes, is more valuable than the immediate benefits he would receive from signing up for the Medicare program, even taking into account the three inexpensive generic drugs he also takes. The letter telling Mr. Bach that he must choose between Bristol-Myers's program and the new Medicare drug benefit speaks to an unintended effect that the new Medicare plan is having on the pharmaceutical industry's charity drug programs. Some companies are simply eliminating their charity programs for older people, taking the position that the recipients are now eligible for Medicare drug coverage. But even in programs like Bristol's that will remain in place for the low-income elderly, the us-or-them ultimatum throws one more tricky variable into retirees' assessment of the Medicare plan. The drug companies, which distributed free drugs with a retail value of $4.1 billion last year to an estimated three million to four million Americans, will continue their charity programs in some cases, focusing on other patients with financial needs who don't qualify for the Medicare prescription drug program. But the companies also complain that the Medicare law means that a patient cannot get drug subsidies from them and also participate in the program. Dr. Mark McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during an interview late last week that nothing prevented the industry programs from continuing, as long as the free or subsidized drugs the patients received were not counted toward their Medicare co-payments or deductibles. Several drug companies have sent proposals to the Health and Human Services department, asking for guidance, and its Office of Inspector General is reviewing their legality. The Medicare Rights Center, an organization that helps Medicare recipients understand the system (and where Mr. Bach works part-time), is monitoring the changes in the charity programs. Those programs are generally aimed at people whose incomes fall near the poverty level - but who make too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor. "It's an important issue to see what the drug companies will do with these plans," said Robert M. Hayes, president of the center. "It's yet one more blow to the algorithm of informed decision-making." The decision by Bristol-Myers is similar to the stance of Merck, which said it would be notifying the affected patients.

Those developments came after Bristol-Myers said Thursday that it might abandon development of a major drug. The company earned $964 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $758 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Sales were $4.77 billion, down slightly from $4.78 billion, as the company, which makes Pravachol to lower cholesterol and the anticlotting agent Plavix, continues to struggle with generic competition. After charges and extraordinary items, earnings were 31 cents a share, 2 cents lower than estimates. The drug maker, which is based in New York, also said it expected its full-year earnings from continuing operations to be in the middle of its previously announced guidance of $1.35 to $1.45 a share.

Dropping the drug, Pargluva, an oral treatment for diabetes, would be a setback for Bristol-Myers and its Pargluva marketing partner, Merck. The shares of both companies fell in after-hours trading, following Bristol-Myers's release of a statement discussing its options. The company said it was weighing whether to drop the project or to conduct a five-year cardiovascular safety study that would be required to answer questions recently raised by the Food and Drug Administration. Bristol-Myers said it was in discussions with the F.D.A. about its next step and would "consider a range of options including conducting additional studies or terminating further development." Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck announced last evening that they had begun negotiations to dissolve their collaboration. Pargluva, a treatment for Type 2 diabetes, would have been the first of a new class of drugs aimed at regulating blood sugar while also improving fat levels in the blood. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck had hoped to begin marketing the product late this year. Some analysts had predicted that Pargluva would be a blockbuster, because 18 million Americans have Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes. Bristol-Myers had wanted to be the first company to market with such a drug, called a dual PPAR-agonist, and had viewed Pargluva as an important addition to its product line. Last month an F.D.A. advisory panel had recommended by a vote of 8 to 1 that the agency approve the drug. But the recommendation had stirred controversy, because the panelists who voted included no cardiologists, despite the fact that F.D.A. staff had raised questions about the drug's cardiovascular safety. The F.D.A. said last week that it needed more information to approve Pargluva. At the time, the company had indicated that the F.D.A. questions could be handled quickly with existing data. Bristol-Myers said last night, however, that after discussions with the F.D.A., it had realized more studies were necessary. "We have determined that to receive regulatory approval and to achieve commercial success, additional studies may be required because the ongoing trials were not designed to answer questions raised by the F.D.A.," the company's spokesman, Tony Plohoros, said in an e-mailed statement last night. "The additional studies could take approximately five years to complete." Bristol-Myers, which is to report its third-quarter results today, made the announcement after the close of regular trading on Wall Street. After hours, Bristol-Myers shares were off $1.17, or 5.4 percent, to $20.50. Merck was off 75 cents, or 2.8 percent, at $26.17. The F.D.A. decision last week to delay approval of the drug came several days before the release of a negative article and accompanying editorial in the influential Journal of the American Medical Association. The article concluded that Pargluva doubled the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects, recommending that a long-term study be conducted before its approval. One of the authors, Dr. Steven E. Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said yesterday he was pleased that the F.D.A. was seeking a comprehensive safety trial of the drug. "If the company is confident of the drug's safety, they should do the trial," Dr. Nissen said. "But if they are not confident, they should kill the drug." Merck had a relatively small share of the Pargluva deal, having given Bristol-Myers a $100 million upfront payment. Merck also has its own new Type 2 diabetes product in development, one of another new class called DPP-IV inhibitors, which work by inhibiting the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone involved in controlling blood sugar levels. Bristol-Myers has also said it is developing a DPP-IV. More Articles in Business &gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb said last night that it might abandon a proposed diabetes drug that it had been developing for years and had until recently hoped might become a blockbuster. Dropping the drug, Pargluva, an oral treatment for diabetes, would be a setback for Bristol-Myers and its Pargluva marketing partner, Merck. The shares of both companies fell in after-hours trading, following Bristol-Myers's release of a statement discussing its options. The company said it was weighing whether to drop the project or to conduct a five-year cardiovascular safety study that would be required to answer questions recently raised by the Food and Drug Administration. Bristol-Myers said it was in discussions with the F.D.A. about its next step and would "consider a range of options including conducting additional studies or terminating further development." Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck announced last evening that they had begun negotiations to dissolve their collaboration. Pargluva, a treatment for Type 2 diabetes, would have been the first of a new class of drugs aimed at regulating blood sugar while also improving fat levels in the blood. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck had hoped to begin marketing the product late this year. Some analysts had predicted that Pargluva would be a blockbuster, because 18 million Americans have Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes. Bristol-Myers had wanted to be the first company to market with such a drug, called a dual PPAR-agonist, and had viewed Pargluva as an important addition to its product line.

The companies had been counting on selling the drug by late this year. The timetable was delayed earlier this week when the F.D.A. told them that Pargluva was approvable but only after the agency reviewed more safety data from completed studies. The type of safety study called for by the journal would mean that Pargluva would not reach consumers for at least two years, if at all. The article by authors including Dr. Steven E. Nissen and Dr. Eric J. Topol and the editorial appeared on the Web site of The Journal of the American Medical Association (jama.ama-assn.org), which put the information out before its print publication in what it called the interest of public health. The editorial, by Dr. James M. Brophy of McGill University in Montreal, also raised concerns about a cancer risk with Pargluva and listed eight ways that the companies' methodology for patient trials might have - perhaps unintentionally, he said - skewed results in favor of Pargluva's approval. Among them, he said, studies of the drug included low-risk patients who were unlikely to have serious side effects and excluded other likely users of the drug with high cardiovascular risks, like elderly patients who often have Type 2 diabetes. Responding to the article and editorial, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Tony Plohoros, said the company had not yet thoroughly reviewed the analysis in the journal, but added, "It's widely known that there are many different and appropriate ways to analyze data." Mr. Plohoros, who said he was also speaking on behalf of the company's marketing partner, Merck, denied the editorial's suggestions that the clinical trials were intended to achieve positive results. "The trials were designed like any other clinical trial for a diabetes drug," he said. They were designed by outside experts and "thought leaders" in diabetes treatment, Mr. Plohoros added. Bristol-Myers had hoped that Pargluva would reinvigorate its franchise in diabetes, a $20 billion market. Merck is eager for new drugs after its withdrawal last year of the painkiller Vioxx and related suits. Several months ago, analysts at Friedman Billings Ramsey estimated 2008 sales for Pargluva at $950 million but recently lowered that estimate to $600 million, citing emerging questions about the drug. Bristol-Myers stock was down 1.7 percent yesterday, closing at $21.67. Merck's stock closed unchanged. Besides raising questions about Pargluva, the journal article appeared to challenge the F.D.A. advisory panel process. In an interview, Dr. Nissen criticized the panel that reviewed the drug last month and voted to recommend its approval. Even though the F.D.A. staff was worried about Pargluva's cardiovascular risks, the panel included no cardiologists. Like the article, an analysis by an F.D.A. safety officer, submitted before the panel's vote, said there was a doubling of cardiovascular risks associated with the drug. But the safety officer, unlike the article's authors, concluded that there was no clear pattern to the problems. In disclosures with the journal article, Dr. Nissen said he had consulted for Takeda, Eli Lilly and GlaxoSmithKline as well as other companies. All three companies have diabetes products that would compete with Pargluva. But Dr. Nissen said he accepted no money for his consulting activities and instead asked that it be contributed to charity. In a statement yesterday, the F.D.A. said its officials were "fully aware of the results of the Pargluva clinical trials, both with regard to safety and efficacy, and likewise appreciate the need for careful assessment of risk versus benefit for all drugs, particularly those indicated for long-term, preventive therapy." Because diabetes is a chronic disease, drugs used to treat it are frequently taken long term. If approved, Pargluva would be the first of a new class of drugs called dual PPAR-agonists. The drugs are aimed at receptors in cells that regulate fat and sugar. Stimulating those receptors can control blood sugar while improving levels of cholesterol and other fats, or lipids. The concept is beguiling because many of the 18 million Americans with diabetes also have excessive lipid levels. Still, attempts to develop dual PPAR-agonists have run into trouble in clinical trials, with some companies abandoning efforts. The analysis found that in trials involving 2,374 patients taking Pargluva, 35 receiving Pargluva - or 1.47 percent - experienced death, heart attacks or strokes. That compared with 9 of the 1,352 patients in a control group, or 0.67 percent. When other cardiovascular problems were included in the analysis, like mini- strokes and congestive heart failure, 2.11 percent of Pargluva patients had adverse events compared with 0.81 percent for control subjects.

The companies said the agency wanted additional information from patient trials completed since Bristol-Myers and Merck submitted data in support of their application. The F.D.A. decision, which found the drug approvable if additional information was submitted, followed an advisory panel meeting in September in which the agency sought guidance on the drug's cardiovascular safety. Although it noted safety concerns, the panel recommended approval. Bristol-Myers, which developed Pargluva, had hoped the drug would reinvigorate its diabetes franchise, which has been struggling against generic competition. Partly because of the company's relatively small and specialized sales force, Bristol-Myers teamed with Merck, which was to supply marketing muscle. In a research note yesterday, the investment banking and brokerage house Friedman Billings Ramsey predicted a delay of about a year in Pargluva's introduction, to late 2006, and slightly lowered its earnings estimates for both companies. A pool of five studies submitted by the companies revealed that patients receiving Pargluva suffered about double the risk of cardiovascular deaths or other adverse events - ranging from angina to heart attack and stroke - compared with patients receiving sugar pills or another drug. Despite those questions about heart attack and stroke, the F.D.A.'s advisory panel last month did not include a cardiologist. The one board-certified cardiologist who normally sits on the panel reviewing diabetes drugs, Dr. Jorge Plutzky of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, did not participate in the Pargluva review, citing a potential conflict of interest. Dr. Plutzky is an expert on the class of drugs that includes Pargluva, called dual PPAR-agonists, and he has served as a consultant to both Bristol-Myers and Merck. He has also given talks on PPAR-agonists that were paid for by Bristol-Myers. During the advisory panel meeting, members seemed confused over the cardiovascular profile of the drug, at first appearing to tilt against its approval but finally approving it 8 to 1, with some members urging additional safety studies. In response to a reporter's question yesterday about the makeup of the advisory panel, the F.D.A. released a statement saying the agency had "the appropriate experts represented" to answer its questions about the drug. "Endocrinologists routinely treat diabetes and lipid problems in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and so they are intimately familiar with the cardiovascular risk," the statement said. During the September hearing, the panel members said they found comfort in the fact that beyond the five studies submitted and another five already under way, the companies planned four more, including a long-term study of cardiovascular safety. After the panel's vote last month, Friedman Billings Ramsey lowered its 2008 sales estimate for Pargluva, to $600 million, from $950 million. Friedman Billings cited questions over the drug's cardiovascular risks and a separate decision by the F.D.A. advisory panel that the drug should not be taken along with sulfonylureas, an oral medication to lower blood sugar that is used by about one-third of those with diabetes in the United States. The sulfonylureas stricture appeared to limit the potential market for the drug. Yesterday, Friedman Billings lowered 2006 and 2007 earnings estimates for Bristol-Myers by 3 cents and 7 cents respectively, and lowered Merck earning estimates for 2006 by 1 cent. Bristol-Myers fell 26 cents yesterday, to close at $22.22 a share, while Merck ended the day at $27.05 a share, down 3 cents.

A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel in Silver Spring, Md., recommended approval yesterday of the Bristol-Myers Squibb diabetes drug, Pargluva, deciding that its benefits outweighed its potentially serious heart risks. But no cardiologist was present for the vote. The panel's cardiologist, Dr. Jorge Plutzky, was in Boston attending to patients, he said yesterday in a telephone interview. One reason he skipped the meeting, he said, was a potential conflict of interest: he has conducted extensive research on PPAR-agonists, the class of drugs being debated. "I suspected that at the end of the day, I would not be able to sit in on it," said Dr. Plutzky, who has served as a consultant for Bristol-Myers, according to disclosures in his research papers. The absence of the only heart doctor on the Pargluva advisory panel is but one illustration of how conflicts of interest can affect the deliberations of F.D.A. panels, in which outside committees help the agency decide whether to approve new drugs. The 8 to 1 vote to endorse Pargluva was the second advisory vote this week in favor of a new diabetes treatment. On Thursday, a panel with some of the same members voted to recommend Exubera, a new inhaled form of insulin developed by Pfizer in partnership with Sanofi-Aventis and Nektar Therapeutics. Both panel votes raised conflict-of-interest issues, according to an analysis by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington consumer group that has pushed to end such conflicts. Several members of the Pargluva panel who, unlike Dr. Plutzky, participated, had conflicts that were disclosed to the F.D.A. "The public's faith in the integrity of the process is undermined when one-third of an advisory committee's membership has significant financial ties to the company seeking the product's approval," said Merrill Goozner, director of the center's Integrity in Science project. In a news release yesterday, the center said three of the Exubera committee's nine members had previously consulted or spoken for Pfizer or Nektar Therapeutics. One other member of that panel - the acting chairman - held stock in the Pfizer, the center said, but the news release did not note that he voted against Exubera. One of the panel members participated, but did not vote, as result of his industry ties. Two of the doctors who were granted waivers for Thursday's meeting participated again in yesterday's panel meeting on Pargluva. A third waiver was granted yesterday, as well, to a physician who has consulted or spoken for competitors of Bristol-Myers Squibb. The issue of potential conflicts by drug reviewers is currently alive on Capitol Hill, where the House has narrowly adopted legislation that would bar scientists with drug industry ties from participating in F.D.A. panels. Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, has promised to introduce a similar measure when the Senate takes up the F.D.A. appropriations bill, as early as next week. An F.D.A. spokeswoman, Susan Cruzan, defended the decision to hold yesterday's Pargluva hearing without the presence of a cardiologist, saying that the remaining panelists had sufficient expertise. Ms. Cruzan declined to comment on Dr. Plutzky because he did not participate. The appearance of conflicts of interest is a complex issue, according to Dr. Plutzky, who noted that the scientists most knowledgeable about drugs being reviewed are often those who have received research grants from drug companies. "Ultimately, the F.D.A. needs to have a source of valid and rigorous information," he said yesterday. Bristol-Myers would co-market Pargluva with Merck if it the F.D.A. acts on the panel's recommendation by approving the drug. Pargula is designed to control blood sugar and, at the same time, reduce triglycerides, a form of fat found in the blood. Diabetics also frequently have high triglyceride levels. The consumer group Public Citizen argued during yesterday's hearing against Pargluva's approval, citing increased cardiovascular deaths among the drug's users in clinical trials. But Bristol-Myers said that benefits of the drug - lower blood sugar and triglycerides - outweighed any risks. In effort to address safety concerns, Bristol-Myers said it planned to conduct a 15,000-patient safety study following the drug's approval, which could come later this year. The panel's endorsement yesterday ended a good week for Bristol-Myers. On Tuesday, a separate advisory panel cleared Orencia, a new injectable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, also developed by the company. Analysts have said that combined sales of the two drugs could surpass $2 billion by 2008. Those sales would be vital to Bristol, which has lost patent protection on several of its major products.

Those sales would be vital to Bristol, which has lost patent protection on several of its major products.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/business/07bristol.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Panel Recommends Drug<date>Published: September 7, 2005</date><text>WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 (AP) - A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recommended approval on Tuesday for a new drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a sometimes disabling condition that affects an estimated 2.1 million Americans, most of them women.

Instead, the company's management is frenetically preparing for the week after Labor Day. That is when two separate Food and Drug Administration advisory panels, meeting Sept. 6 and 9, are scheduled to review two new drug applications from Bristol-Myers - Orencia for rheumatoid arthritis and Pargluva for diabetes. Company teams will spend much of the next two weeks rehearsing their presentations to the panels. Skip to next paragraph Keith Bedford for The New York Times Peter Dolan's new drug development strategy is put to the test. Forum: Markets and Industries If the drugs win F.D.A. approval, some analysts say that combined sales of the two products could surpass $2 billion by 2008 - helping replace revenue the company might forgo after its second-largest seller, the cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, loses patent protection next year. But the new drugs are coming up for review at a difficult time, and not only because it is unusual for one company to have two medicines under consideration in a single week. In the post-Vioxx era, the agency seems to be recalibrating its requirements for new drug approval, more carefully weighing the risks versus the benefits. While Orencia is widely expected to be recommended by its advisory panel - the F.D.A. itself will have final say - Pargluva raises safety questions that make its approval no sure bet. The hearings are an important test of Bristol-Myers's new strategy of aiming drugs at a narrower range of disease. In 2003, with its stock slumping and its distribution practices under federal scrutiny, the company's chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, decided that instead of spreading its efforts thinly across 35 disease categories, Bristol should build franchises in 10 areas. The company defined those as serious diseases with unmet medical needs, and besides diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis the categories were AIDS and HIV; Alzheimer's disease; atherosclerosis and thrombosis; cancer; hepatitis; obesity; psychiatric disorders; and solid organ transplantation. Even as it tests this approach the company also has the challenge of operating under the rigors of a federal compliance plan, part of a deferred prosecution deal with the Justice Department in June. To avoid criminal charges, the company agreed to pay $300 million to compensate shareholders for its former practice of artificially inflating sales by flooding wholesale inventory channels. Bristol also faces a civil lawsuit challenging the patent for Plavix, a blood-clot prevention product it co-markets with the French company Sanofi-Aventis. With $3.3 billion in sales for Bristol during 2004, Plavix accounted for a big portion of the company's $19.38 billion revenue last year. If Bristol wins the civil case, brought by the Canadian generic drug company Apotex, the Plavix patent remains in force until 2011. If it loses the patent, the company has said it might have to reduce its dividend. A trial is expected this year in federal court in Manhattan. Meanwhile, for Bristol-Myers's second-biggest product, Pravachol, with $2.6 billion in sales last year, the only uncertainty is how big a hit those sales will take after its patent expires next April and generic competitors come on the market. The company's third-largest selling drug, Avapro, for high blood pressure, was a $930 million product last year. Bristol-Myers's stock closed yesterday at $24.42, about the midpoint of a narrow 12-month trading range between $22.75 and $26.60. Mr. Dolan has said he hopes to return the company to sustained earnings growth beginning in 2007, and several analysts see prospects for the company brightening as a result of its new strategy and pipeline. That includes the two drugs set for review next month - the rheumatoid arthritis medicine Orencia, also known as abatacept, and the diabetes drug Pargluva, also known as muraglitazar. Diabetes has long been an important area for Bristol-Myers, but generic competition has meant that the company's current diabetes lines, Glucophage and Glucovance, now have but a fraction of their combined sales of more than $2.3 billion in 2001. "In our view, muraglitazar could enable the company to reinvigorate is diabetes treatment franchise," said a investment report from Friedman Billings Ramsey, which predicts Pargluva's sales at $729 million by 2008. Pargluva could also give a boost to the battered drug giant Merck, which would be co-marketing the product. Bristol-Myers's partnership with Merck for Pargluva was another part of Mr. Dolan's streamlined business strategy, which included trimming his company's sales force. With fewer representatives, the company needs the Merck alliance to help court the primary care physicians who treat diabetes. Pargluva is a member of a class of diabetes treatments called PPAR-agonists. But Bristol-Myers is trumpeting it as the first one that works on two fronts by controlling blood glucose levels and also lowering triglycerides, a form of fat in the blood. Diabetics frequently also have high triglyceride levels. Despite the obvious advantages of such drugs, though, several companies have abandoned programs to develop them because of safety concerns. One, Merck's MK-767, was dropped after company tests found links to tumors in lab animals. Bristol-Myers has said its own two-year studies of cancer in rodents found only "species-specific" cancers. Pargluva's safety profile appears to be similar to that of two diabetes treatments now on the market - Actos, a product of Eli Lilly and Takeda, and Avandia by GlaxoSmithKline. Drugs in the class generally carry the side effects of weight gain, water retention and worsening of congestive heart failure. A note to investors in June by a Merrill Lynch analyst, David R. Risinger, predicted Pargluva sales of $1.09 billion by 2009, if approved this fall. But he cautioned that, because of safety concerns in class, the F.D.A. might delay approval of Pargluva and request additional studies. More certain for approval is the drug Orencia, a monthly infusion treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Friedman Billings Ramsey estimated sales of Orencia at $1.3 billion by 2008. Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar, Bristol-Myers's senior vice president for strategy and medical external affairs, said the drugs were a test of the company's new focus.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the lawsuit against Frederick S. Schiff, Bristol-Myers's former chief financial officer, and Richard J. Lane, former executive vice president and president of the pharmaceutical company's worldwide medicines group. The S.E.C. is seeking unspecified civil penalties against the two former executives. The suit accuses them of instructing staff members in 2000 and 2001 to create incentive packages for the company's biggest wholesalers to inflate sales and profit figures, while misleading Wall Street analysts and investors. Lawyers for Mr. Schiff and Mr. Lane disputed the charges and said their clients would contest them. Mr. Schiff and Mr. Lane pleaded not guilty in June to the criminal charges. They remain free on bond. Also in June, Bristol-Myers agreed to pay $300 million in a deal with the Justice Department to avoid prosecution on a criminal conspiracy charge stemming from its accounting scandal. The company has agreed to pay about $800 million to settle suits and investigations tied to the incentives it paid its wholesalers to stockpile inventory, inflating sales and earnings. In March 2003, Bristol-Myers restated $900 million in profits and $2.5 billion in revenue from 1999 through the first half of 2002. Bristol-Myers also agreed, in August 2004, to pay $150 million to settle the S.E.C.'s related civil charges of manipulating its inventory of drugs to inflate earnings. The inventory manipulation is known as "channel stuffing" - packing distribution channels with excess inventory. The practice is not illegal, but some industry observers have called the level at Bristol-Myers excessive.

The company reported a second-quarter profit of $1 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $527 million, or 27 cents, in the quarter a year ago. Excluding special items, earnings from continuing operations rose 3 percent, to 47 cents a share. Wall Street had expected 36 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales of significant new drugs, like the blood clot medicine Plavix, grew sharply in the quarter, offset by plunging sales of older medicines that face generic competition. Revenue, although little changed, was about $100 million better than Wall Street expected. "Results were definitely better than expected, in large part because of the company's favorable tax rate, but the company's worsening earnings picture has not really changed," an analyst at Deutsche Bank, Barbara Ryan, said. She was referring to Bristol-Myers's expectations of declining profit this year and in 2006 because of competition from generic drugs, including American copycats expected by next April for the company's Pravachol cholesterol medication. Overall results were helped largely by $294 million in tax benefits that enabled Bristol to pay no taxes. The benefits came from the resolution of tax contingencies and an adjustment of taxes on overseas profits the company plans to repatriate this year. Bristol took $269 million in new charges in the quarter to increase legal reserves, mostly to deal with a scandal in which it improperly inflated earnings by manipulating inventories. It took $455 million in legal charges in the 2004 quarter. Those charges, however, were offset by income from insurance recoveries. Sales of the company's top-selling drug, Plavix, jumped 26 percent, to $968 million. Revenue from the hypertension treatment Avapro rose 11 percent, to $258 million. Bristol's Abilify schizophrenia drug, which does not cause the weight gain that rival medicines do, almost doubled sales to $240 million. But sales of Pravachol fell 5 percent, to $625 million, hurt by generic competition in overseas markets. Sales of the cancer drugs Taxol and Paraplatin also fell sharply because of patent expirations that have opened the floodgates to cheaper generics. Shares rose 7 cents, to $25.17.

Strong drug sales in Europe helped the company make better-than-expected second-quarter results, even though business conditions in the United States remained difficult, the company's chief executive, Daniel L. Vasella, said Thursday. Skip to next paragraph Stefan Wermuth/Reuters Daniel L. Vasella, chief of Novartis, expects growth in generics. Enlarge This Image Joyce Dopkeen/The New York Times Novartis's research center in Cambridge, Mass., led by Mark Fishman, is focusing on rare diseases, hoping to speed drug development. Novartis reported a net profit of $1.65 billion, while earnings per share rose 11 percent, to 70 cents. Global sales increased 12 percent over the year-ago quarter, to $7.8 billion, and exceeded analysts' expectations of about $7.6 billion. In the United States, sales rose a slower 9 percent, to $2 billion. "We had strong growth in Europe - mainly in Germany and France - and also in Japan, which helped offset some of the relatively weak growth in the United States," Mr. Vasella said in a telephone interview. Drug sales in Germany did particularly well after the government this year reduced the mandatory rebates that manufacturers pay on some products, Mr. Vasella said. "These numbers were above expectations," said Bob Pooler, an analyst with Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch, a private bank in Geneva. "It's a good sign for Novartis." In other news, Novartis announced Thursday that it would buy the North American over-the-counter division of Bristol-Myers Squibb, including its pain medication Excedrin, for $660 million in cash. The acquisition gives Novartis an entry into the United States' analgesic market, the country's largest over-the-counter category with annual sales of $2 billion. In addition to Excedrin, the Bristol-Myers portfolio includes the Keri skin care products line and other products. Sales of the entire line reached $258 million in 2004. Bristol-Myers had announced early this year it would sell its consumer products division to focus on its core business. At Novartis, the outlook for 2005 remains clouded by price pressures, Dr. Vasella said, especially in the United States where drug companies are engaged in discount battles with rivals to win market share, which could hurt sales of Diovan. Novartis expects single-digit sales growth over all this year, down from 14 percent in 2004. Novartis relies heavily on Diovan and Gleevec, which together brought in about a third of the company's pharmaceutical sales of $5.13 billion in the second quarter. Diovan sales rose 20 percent, and Gleevec 33 percent. Other big sellers were Femara, a breast cancer drug for postmenopausal women, and Zometa, a treatment for cancer that has spread to the bones. Rivals like Genentech, a United States biotechnology company controlled by Roche of Switzerland, have had more success recently in bringing new drugs to market. This week, Genentech reported a 39 percent increase in sales to $1.3 billion in the second quarter. The rise was driven by Avastin, a cancer drug Genentech first introduced in the United States last year and in some European countries in the first quarter. Roche, which consolidates Genentech's figures in its statements, will report its financial results on July 20. Novartis expects a number of new drugs in its pipeline to get regulatory approval in 2006, Dr. Vasella said, among them treatments for diabetes, multiple sclerosis, hypertension and hepatitis B. The new compounds have the potential to be "first in class," he added, which should allow Novartis to charge premium prices despite the intense competition in the United States. But Novartis is also charting a new course in developing drugs. Mr. Vasella, a former physician, has revamped the company's research strategy, which he is hoping will reduce the time and cost of developing new medicines. Pharmaceutical companies generally test drugs by targeting a single gene or protein. But scientists at Novartis's global research center in Cambridge, Mass., led by a former Harvard Medical School professor, Mark C. Fishman, have started focusing on rare diseases as a way of getting a jump on drug development. For instance, his team recently used a small number of people with Muckle-Wells syndrome - a rare inflammatory disease that can cause hives, fever and deafness and can be fatal - to test a cure. But the protein that causes Muckle-Wells is also active in people with arthritis, researchers found, and may lead to a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a much more common condition. Early stage drug testing, known as Phase 1, is normally done in healthy volunteers to check whether a drug is safe, and only later on people with the disease. But for rare, serious diseases, regulators allow researchers to test the drugs initially on patients. Novartis hopes to find out more quickly whether a drug works and get it to market faster, but also to save money by terminating studies if results are negative. "It's a change in focus," Dr. Vasella said. "In the optimum case, it will take out one year or two years" from a drug's development time. Novartis acknowledges that it runs a risk in putting resources into rare diseases if this does not translate into breakthroughs on more widespread diseases - and thus greater revenues. The company would still have to go through large late-stage clinical trials involving hundreds of patients for broader-use drugs - the stage at which most drugs normally fail. "They may speed up Phase 1, but they're still going to have to work out safety issues," said Mark Monane, an analyst with Needham &amp; Company, an investment bank in New York. Dr. Vasella, who has headed Novartis since it was formed in a 1996 merger of the Swiss firms Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, is also expanding the company's generic drug business. In February, the company announced the $8.4 billion purchase of Hexal of Germany and Eon Labs of the United States, a deal that, once completed in the third quarter, will make Novartis the world's largest generic drug company. Dr. Vasella is betting that the market for generics will grow more strongly than branded medicines as governments and patients search for cheaper drugs.

The rise was driven by Avastin, a cancer drug Genentech first introduced in the United States last year and in some European countries in the first quarter. Roche, which consolidates Genentech's figures in its statements, will report its financial results on July 20. Novartis expects a number of new drugs in its pipeline to get regulatory approval in 2006, Dr. Vasella said, among them treatments for diabetes, multiple sclerosis, hypertension and hepatitis B. The new compounds have the potential to be "first in class," he added, which should allow Novartis to charge premium prices despite the intense competition in the United States. But Novartis is also charting a new course in developing drugs. Mr. Vasella, a former physician, has revamped the company's research strategy, which he is hoping will reduce the time and cost of developing new medicines. Pharmaceutical companies generally test drugs by targeting a single gene or protein. But scientists at Novartis's global research center in Cambridge, Mass., led by a former Harvard Medical School professor, Mark C. Fishman, have started focusing on rare diseases as a way of getting a jump on drug development. For instance, his team recently used a small number of people with Muckle-Wells syndrome - a rare inflammatory disease that can cause hives, fever and deafness and can be fatal - to test a cure. But the protein that causes Muckle-Wells is also active in people with arthritis, researchers found, and may lead to a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a much more common condition. Early stage drug testing, known as Phase 1, is normally done in healthy volunteers to check whether a drug is safe, and only later on people with the disease. But for rare, serious diseases, regulators allow researchers to test the drugs initially on patients. Novartis hopes to find out more quickly whether a drug works and get it to market faster, but also to save money by terminating studies if results are negative. "It's a change in focus," Dr. Vasella said. "In the optimum case, it will take out one year or two years" from a drug's development time. Novartis acknowledges that it runs a risk in putting resources into rare diseases if this does not translate into breakthroughs on more widespread diseases - and thus greater revenues. The company would still have to go through large late-stage clinical trials involving hundreds of patients for broader-use drugs - the stage at which most drugs normally fail. "They may speed up Phase 1, but they're still going to have to work out safety issues," said Mark Monane, an analyst with Needham &amp; Company, an investment bank in New York. Dr. Vasella, who has headed Novartis since it was formed in a 1996 merger of the Swiss firms Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, is also expanding the company's generic drug business. In February, the company announced the $8.4 billion purchase of Hexal of Germany and Eon Labs of the United States, a deal that, once completed in the third quarter, will make Novartis the world's largest generic drug company. Dr. Vasella is betting that the market for generics will grow more strongly than branded medicines as governments and patients search for cheaper drugs.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/16/business/16bristol.html?ref=bristolmyerssquibbcompany">Fraud Case Filed Against Ex-Officers of Bristol<date>Published: June 16, 2005</date><text>Two former executives of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company were indicted yesterday on conspiracy and securities fraud charges related to a wholesale inventory manipulation that artificially inflated company revenues by millions of dollars. Bristol-Myers, meanwhile, agreed to pay $300 million in penalties but avoided indictment in connection in the case. The accusations, filed in Newark, charge that Frederick S. Schiff, the company's former finance chief, and Richard J. Lane, who ran its worldwide medicines group, misled investors by concealing the excess inventory held by Bristol-Myers wholesalers, a result of an aggressive program of rebates and discounts offered by the company to meet its sales targets. The $300 million will compensate shareholders financially harmed by the manipulation as part of a "deferred prosecution" agreement. In addition, Bristol-Myers agreed to establish an endowed chair in business ethics at the Seton Hall University Law School in Newark. With the $300 million, Bristol-Myers will have paid a total of $839 million in penalties related to the scheme, involving a practice called channel stuffing, which occurred from 1999 to 2001. A spokesman for Bristol-Myers, Tony Plohoros, said yesterday that it planned to take a charge of $249 million in the current quarter to cover the settlement. Also as part of the agreement, the chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, will give up his title as chairman. That job will be filled by the former American Express chief, James Robinson III. The agreement, which was reached between Bristol-Myers and Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in Newark, lifts a cloud that has hung over the company since April 2002, when Mr. Dolan announced that sales would be sharply lower than expected because wholesalers had been stocking excess inventories of its products. The company, based in New York, later restated results, lowering revenue by $2.5 billion and profit by $900 million. Mr. Dolan's announcement led to investigations, both by Mr. Christie's office and by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as investor lawsuits. The case also had a profound impact on the pharmaceutical industry, essentially bringing to an end a common practice known as speculative buying in which wholesalers held excess inventory in advance of price increases. Speculative buying was the way wholesalers made much of their profits. With the elimination of the practice, manufacturers have been forced to enter agreements to compensate wholesalers in other ways. Inventory practices at Bristol-Myers went beyond those of other companies, Mr. Christie's office charged, employing accounting and bookkeeping gimmicks to mask the increasing rise in wholesaler inventory levels. In announcing the agreement and related indictments yesterday, Mr. Christie said the scheme reflected a corporate culture at Bristol-Myers at the time that emphasized higher sales at all costs as the company strove to meet Wall Street profit forecasts. The inventory manipulation made it appear that demand for Bristol-Myers's products was greater than it actually was, raising the company's sales and outlook. "These people had knowledge which they should have disclosed to the investing public, which they did not," Mr. Christie said. "It's not a channel-stuffing case. It's a failure-to- disclose case." Mr. Schiff, 57, of Manhattan and Mr. Lane, 54, of Doylestown, Pa., were expected to appear in United States District Court in Newark today to answer the accusations, which could result in up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. The indictment accuses both men of misleading investment analysts. In October 2000, the indictment said, Mr. Lane responded to an analyst's question about wholesaler inventories by saying, "I don't think there was any significant wholesaler inventory activity in the quarter." In April 2001, Mr. Schiff responded similarly when asked by an investment analyst, the indictment charged, saying, "There are no unusual items that we see in the inventory levels." A lawyer for Mr. Schiff, David M. Zornow, issued a statement yesterday that his client vigorously denied wrongdoing and accused the government of "overreaching." "Mr. Schiff did not operate in a vacuum; his conduct was appropriate at all times and known to many others, both inside and outside the company," the statement said. Mr. Lane's lawyer, Richard M. Strassberg, said his client was "innocent of all charges" and "intends to fight them." At one point, it was believed that Mr. Dolan and his predecessor, Charles A. Heimbold Jr., were under investigation. Mr. Christie said yesterday that he would not comment on any individuals who were not charged. Under the deferred-prosecution agreement, Mr. Christie's office filed a criminal complaint against Bristol-Myers, but agreed not to prosecute it for two years. If the company complies with its obligations to the government, the criminal charges will be dismissed. In addition to the $300 million fine, the chair at Seton Hall, and the appointment of Mr. Robinson as a non-executive board chairman, the company agreed to continue employing a former United States district judge, Frederick B. Lacey, to monitor its operations. The company is also required to appoint an additional nonexecutive director acceptable to Mr. Christie's office. Deferred-prosecution agreements are becoming increasingly common in corporate prosecutions. While some have criticized them as slaps on the wrist, the arrangements were defended by Mr. Christie yesterday in a statement. "We balanced the need for punishment with an acknowledgement that this company provides great value and that its work should continue," he said.

Skip to next paragraph Bristol, maker of Sustiva, revises its advertising plans on new drugs. The company said it wanted to give doctors time to understand new products before patients begin asking for them. "We want to make sure that before we start mass media - television, radio and print branded advertising - that physicians have a level of comfort about the treatment and which patients are appropriate for it," Brian Henry, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers, said. The 12-month ban is part of a new advertising code the company posted on its Web site yesterday. Despite the growing backlash against direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals, Mr. Henry said the company is not aware of any similar codes in the industry. In the eight years since the Food and Drug Administration lifted a prohibition on consumer advertising, drug ads have become a $3.8 billion business. The constant drumbeat of spots, mostly on television, is so effective that patients demand prescriptions from their doctors, and some critics accuse the physicians of obliging even though the drugs might not be best for the patient. The practice has become particularly controversial in the last year in the wake of disclosures that the prescription painkillers known as cox-2 inhibitors were linked to cardiac problems. Advertising and marketing played a role in the widespread use of two of the drugs, Vioxx and Celebrex, by many patients who would have done just as well with less expensive over-the-counter remedies, critics have said. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group, is expected to adopt its industrywide code next month, but apparently will stop short of embracing anything like the 12-month moratorium on advertising new drugs. "We believe passionately that patients have a right to know about new drugs which may save their lives or improve the quality of their lives," said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the trade group, known as PhRMA. Mr. Johnson said that the "finishing touches" were being put on the new code, but he would not divulge its contents. The chief executive of Bristol-Myers, Peter R. Dolan, is slated to become chairman of the industry trade group next year. Mr. Dolan's company has been working to improve its image in the wake of investigations of its accounting practices by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Direct-to-consumer advertising became an issue in last year's presidential campaign, with the Democrats holding drug advertising partly responsible for ever-increasing prescription costs and inflation in the nation's health care bills. Lawmakers, both at the federal and state levels, have also embraced the issue. One bill pending in Congress, sponsored by Representative James P. Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, would ban the broadcast of all erectile dysfunction ads from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., a measure partly aimed at limiting the exposure to children of the suggestive content of ads for Viagra, Cialis and Levitra. In addition to placing a 12-month moratorium on consumer advertising of new drugs, Bristol-Myers' code calls for advertising to "appropriate audiences at appropriate times of the day" - a section apparently influenced by ubiquitous erectile dysfunction advertising. The code also said that all company ads will inform poor patients that assistance programs are available to help them get medications. Bristol-Myers is based in New York.

And the channel-stuffing scheme at the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb was no exception. For several years, Bristol-Myers paid wholesalers to stockpile goods, which the company booked as legitimate sales. The practice is called channel stuffing. The result of the deception, which went on from at least 1999 to 2002, was that Bristol's bottom line looked good. Investors got a rosy picture. But it could only continue for so long. There was a limit to how much wholesalers could store. Ultimately, Bristol came clean and restated its earnings in 2002 and 2003, admitting it had inflated revenues by about $2.5 billion and profits by about $900 million during the period in question. The end of that chapter in Bristol's 118-year history apparently is in sight, with an agreement being negotiated between Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, and the United States attorney in Newark, Christopher J. Christie. Mr. Christie's office has been investigating Bristol-Myers for several years and is said to be close to a deferred prosecution agreement that will allow Bristol to pay about $300 million in fines. Less clear is what will happen to several current and former company executives. While indictments could be possible, such agreements more frequently include requirements that company leaders pay back bonuses or stock profits they received, particularly if their compensation was sweetened by inflated company financial reports. The former Bristol chairman and chief executive Charles A. Heimbold Jr., for example, sold stock worth more than $23 million during a period when the company reported inflated profits. Mr. Heimbold, who was later appointed United States ambassador to Sweden, received more than $2 million in bonuses during the same period. Mr. Heimbold's successor, Peter R. Dolan, who had been president and was promoted to succeed Mr. Heimbold in 2001, sold about $2 million worth of stock and received more than $2 million in bonuses. Representatives for both Mr. Heimbold and Mr. Dolan have said the executives were not aware of any scheme to inflate profits at the time the fraud was occurring. Mr. Heimbold, who left his ambassadorship last year, could not be reached for comment. A Bristol-Myers spokesman said yesterday that Mr. Dolan and several other executives declined their 2002 bonuses in light of the corporate scandal. It appears that the government settlement will allow Mr. Dolan to keep his job as chief executive but force him to give up his title as chairman, a possible indication that Mr. Christie's office holds him at least indirectly responsible for some of the corporate mischief. James D. Robinson III, a former American Express chief and longtime member of Bristol's board, is expected to step in as chairman, a development first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. The split of chairman and chief executive titles is a growing trend, a ripple effect of the scandals that have plagued corporate America. Requiring that those jobs be held by two people dilutes power, creating an informal system of checks and balances. In the last few years, Bristol-Myers appears to have cleaned up its act. And Wall Street reacted favorably yesterday to news of a possible settlement. Shares of Bristol-Myers closed at $25.42, up 20 cents. "The scandal is very much in the past," said Barbara A. Ryan, a Deutsche Bank analyst. But Ms. Ryan sees a potentially larger problem looming: a patent challenge to Bristol-Myers's best-selling product, Plavix, which prevents blood clots. Plavix generated $5 billion in sales last year for Bristol-Myers and its marketing partner on the drug, Sanofi-Aventis. Plavix, which ranks third in the world in sales, is worth 40 to 50 cents of the company's expected earnings this year of $1.41, according to Ms. Ryan. A loss of that brand could mean Bristol's $1.28 dividend would be cut. Ms. Ryan handicaps the litigation's outcome as tilted slightly in Bristol's favor, with a 30 percent possibility that the generic challenge will prevail. "It think it's a serious threat," said Ms. Ryan. A paper from the Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, another research firm, also said that the patent challenge had merit. The challenge, filed by Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs, claims that the patent on Plavix is invalid because a former patent, which was held by Sanofi, expired in 2003, making the formulation for Plavix obvious to any scientist. Under patent law, obviousness is a basis for the denial of patent protection. Until the patent litigation is resolved, analysts say the issue will remain a major drag on the company's stock, which has been up by about 12 percent in the past year, but remains 60 percent off its highs of several years ago.

If a deal is reached, the penalties paid by Bristol-Myers will total about $800 million. That would include civil settlements of $389 million reached with investors in the last year and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission of $150 million. The company is expected to take a large charge to pay the Justice Department settlement, probably this quarter, which would affect its operating profit. But a penalty of the size anticipated in this week's settlement is not likely to jeopardize Bristol-Myers's annual dividend, analysts have said. The agreement, which could be formally announced as early as tomorrow, would help close a bleak chapter in the company's 118-year history. During the investigation, which began in 2002, federal agents paid early-morning visits to the homes of retired executives, interviewed more than 100 current and former employees, and pored over boxes of Bristol-Myers documents. In addition to the payments, the agreement with prosecutors is said to require that the company - a producer of drugs, medical devices and over-the-counter health products - establish government-supervised compliance and disclosure and ethics programs to prevent the type of accounting manipulations that prompted the investigation. The accusations against the company involved a practice known as "channel stuffing." Under the practice, Bristol-Myers paid incentives to its wholesalers to stockpile inventory, making it appear as if the company's sales were higher than they actually were. Then, Bristol-Myers reported the inflated revenue figures to investors. The company's chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, acknowledged in 2002 that it had engaged in the practice, and Bristol-Myers said later that the practice had resulted in overstated revenue of about $2.5 billion from 1999 to 2002. The bulk of the problems occurred before Mr. Dolan became chief executive. Bristol-Myers stock, which had traded in the 50's before the acknowledgement, slumped afterward. Since then, the shares have been stuck in the middle 20's, slightly underperforming a battered pharmaceutical industry. The shares closed on Friday at $25.22, down 28 cents. The agreement between Bristol-Myers and the United States attorney in Newark, Christopher J. Christie, is known as a "deferred prosecution." This is an increasingly common arrangement in corporate criminal cases in which charges are delayed - with the promise that they will ultimately be dropped - if the subjects comply with terms required by the prosecutors. While sometimes criticized as slaps on the wrist, deferred prosecution agreements are intended to ensure continued corporate viability and preserve jobs, while at the same time sending a message that the government will not tolerate criminal conduct. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is based in New York, employs about 43,000 people, 6,000 of them in New Jersey. Mr. Christie is said to have been concerned about the impact of his office's investigation on the company, fearing that more severe action would have resulted in layoffs. The company had been cooperating with the government. Mary Jo White, a private lawyer who formerly served as United States attorney in Manhattan, was hired by Bristol-Myers Squibb to handle negotiations with Mr. Christie's office. While a prosecutor, Ms. White was involved in several deferred prosecutions, including a 1994 case in which Prudential Securities acknowledged that it committed crimes in the sale of limited partnerships and agreed to pay $330 million in fines. Prudential was placed on probation for three years, after which charges were dropped. During that period, the company's operations were under government supervision. A Bristol-Myers agreement is expected to work in a similar way. If the agreement is announced this week, Mr. Christie's office is likely to describe the case it could have brought against Bristol-Myers Squibb. A person who has been briefed on the agreement said it would also contain some "special provisions" involving executives of the company. In previous deferred prosecutions, corporate executives have agreed to disgorgement, or repayment of bonuses received as a result of criminal activities. It was not clear whether there would be any such provisions in a Bristol-Myers settlement. A spokesman for the company, Tony Plohoros, declined to comment yesterday on the expected announcement, and a spokesman for Mr. Christie's office, Michael Drewniak, also said he would have no statement. Bristol-Myers's payment of $300 million to investors was in class-action litigation partly related to the channel stuffing accusations. Last week, the company announced that it had settled a related case for $89 million. That was paid to four investors who opted out of the class-action settlement. Bristol-Myers has recently warned investors of impending civil and criminal penalties. In the first quarter, it added $110 million to its litigation-related reserves. The charge resulted in revised first-quarter earnings of $533 million, or 27 cents a share, reflecting a decline of about 45 percent from the quarter a year earlier. The $110 million brought the company's litigation reserve to $140 million, but much of that was depleted by the $89 million. Apparently in anticipation of an announcement this week, Bristol-Myers said that it expected to take another litigation-related charge this quarter, but it did not disclose how much that would be. Among Bristol-Myers's major products are Plavix, which helps prevent blood clots, and Pravachol, a cholesterol-lowering drug. More Articles in Business &gt;The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb is expected to agree to pay nearly $300 million to end a Justice Department criminal investigation of its accounting practices, according to people briefed on the prospective settlement. If a deal is reached, the penalties paid by Bristol-Myers will total about $800 million. That would include civil settlements of $389 million reached with investors in the last year and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission of $150 million. The company is expected to take a large charge to pay the Justice Department settlement, probably this quarter, which would affect its operating profit. But a penalty of the size anticipated in this week's settlement is not likely to jeopardize Bristol-Myers's annual dividend, analysts have said. The agreement, which could be formally announced as early as tomorrow, would help close a bleak chapter in the company's 118-year history. During the investigation, which began in 2002, federal agents paid early-morning visits to the homes of retired executives, interviewed more than 100 current and former employees, and pored over boxes of Bristol-Myers documents. In addition to the payments, the agreement with prosecutors is said to require that the company - a producer of drugs, medical devices and over-the-counter health products - establish government-supervised compliance and disclosure and ethics programs to prevent the type of accounting manipulations that prompted the investigation. The accusations against the company involved a practice known as "channel stuffing." Under the practice, Bristol-Myers paid incentives to its wholesalers to stockpile inventory, making it appear as if the company's sales were higher than they actually were. Then, Bristol-Myers reported the inflated revenue figures to investors. The company's chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, acknowledged in 2002 that it had engaged in the practice, and Bristol-Myers said later that the practice had resulted in overstated revenue of about $2.5 billion from 1999 to 2002. The bulk of the problems occurred before Mr. Dolan became chief executive. Bristol-Myers stock, which had traded in the 50's before the acknowledgement, slumped afterward. Since then, the shares have been stuck in the middle 20's, slightly underperforming a battered pharmaceutical industry. The shares closed on Friday at $25.22, down 28 cents. The agreement between Bristol-Myers and the United States attorney in Newark, Christopher J. Christie, is known as a "deferred prosecution." This is an increasingly common arrangement in corporate criminal cases in which charges are delayed - with the promise that they will ultimately be dropped - if the subjects comply with terms required by the prosecutors. While sometimes criticized as slaps on the wrist, deferred prosecution agreements are intended to ensure continued corporate viability and preserve jobs, while at the same time sending a message that the government will not tolerate criminal conduct. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is based in New York, employs about 43,000 people, 6,000 of them in New Jersey. Mr. Christie is said to have been concerned about the impact of his office's investigation on the company, fearing that more severe action would have resulted in layoffs. The company had been cooperating with the government. Mary Jo White, a private lawyer who formerly served as United States attorney in Manhattan, was hired by Bristol-Myers Squibb to handle negotiations with Mr. Christie's office. While a prosecutor, Ms. White was involved in several deferred prosecutions, including a 1994 case in which Prudential Securities acknowledged that it committed crimes in the sale of limited partnerships and agreed to pay $330 million in fines. Prudential was placed on probation for three years, after which charges were dropped. During that period, the company's operations were under government supervision. A Bristol-Myers agreement is expected to work in a similar way.

The set-aside, which forced the company to lower its previously announced first-quarter operating profit by nearly 16 percent, would raise to $140 million the amount Bristol-Myers has reserved for the government's criminal inquiry. A person who had been briefed on negotiations between Bristol-Myers and Department of Justice said that the company's outlay for a fine or settlement could eventually be "much higher" than $140 million. A Bristol-Myers spokesman, Tony Plohoros, said the company would not comment on the status of the Justice Department case. The investigation involves allegations that Bristol-Myers manipulated its earnings several years ago through a practice known as channel-stuffing by giving financial incentives to wholesalers to buy extra products. Last August, Bristol-Myers settled a case involving the same allegations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, paying $150 million to close the civil charges. At the time, it was the second-largest S.E.C. settlement involving accounting fraud. The company earlier settled a class-action suit over the matter for $300 million. Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in Newark, has been conducting a criminal investigation that is said to be aimed at both the company and several individuals. Richard Evans, an analyst from Sanford C. Bernstein, said yesterday that the company's statement about the $110 million reserve and the revised earnings report "raises more questions than it answers." Mr. Evans said the crucial question involving Bristol-Myers was whether its problems could be settled with an amount that did not threaten its dividend. "We just need more granularity as to how they arrived at the incremental charges," he said. Mary Jo White, a former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York who is now a private lawyer representing Bristol-Myers in negotiations with Mr. Christie's office, could not be reached for comment yesterday. In revising its first-quarter earnings yesterday after the charge, which amounts to $88 million after taxes, the company said that its net earnings from continuing operations were $538 million, not the $626 million it reported April 28. Earnings per share would be 27 cents rather than the 32 cents previously mentioned. Mr. Plohoros said the change was not technically a restatement because the company had not yet filed its report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He added that Bristol-Myers was also revising its earnings guidance for the year to $1.32 to $1.42, a reduction of 5 cents from the range of $1.37 to $1.47 the company projected on April 28. After the announcement, which came after the end of regular-hours trading, the company's shares were down as much as 2.5 percent. The stock had ended regular trading at $25.94, down 4 cents. Even before the extra first-quarter charge, the company's earnings were 36 percent below those of the year-earlier period. The company attributed the decline to patent expirations and increasing competition on some leading products. Those earnings had been in line with analysts' expectations, Mr. Evans said. Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, also said it had received a subpoena from the office of the Massachusetts attorney general, Michael J. Sullivan, as part of his investigation into the promotion of drugs for uses other than those for which they were federally approved.

The warning adds to growing worries about the safety of the widely prescribed drugs. The Food and Drug Administration said that it would now require manufacturers of the medicines to place black-box warnings - the agency's most severe - on the labels of all the drugs. In 2003, the agency required manufacturers to add a warning about an increased risk of diabetes from antipsychotic medications. Zyprexa and Symbyax from Eli Lilly, Risperdal from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Seroquel from AstraZeneca, Abilify from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Clozaril from Novartis and Geodon from Pfizer are all affected by the warning. The drugs belong to a class of medicines developed since 1989 that are supposed to be safer than the older class of medicines for psychosis, like Haldol. In high doses, Haldol and drugs like it can cause a debilitating condition called tardive dyskinesia, a lifelong affliction that can involve uncontrollable trembling, tics and jerky movements. Doctors have become so comfortable with the safety of the newer medicines that they are now among the biggest selling in the world, with some physicians using them to treat a wide range of conditions, including schizophrenia, depression and dementia in the elderly. Indeed, some psychiatrists prescribe cocktails of antipsychotics to patients with persistent mental problems. Zyprexa is the biggest drug expense for many state Medicaid programs, the health insurance for the poor. But the safety of the pills has come under increasing scrutiny. Studies now suggest that the newer drugs are only slightly less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia, and worries about other side effects are mounting. The Food and Drug Administration said that it had analyzed the results of 17 placebo-controlled trials involving the drugs, which are known as atypical antipsychotics. The agency found that elderly patients with dementia who were given the pills were 1.6 to 1.7 times as likely to die as those given placebos. The causes of death varied, although most died of heart-related problems like heart failure or infections like pneumonia, the drug agency said. Representatives for Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson said the companies were reviewing the F.D.A.'s requirement and would work with the agency to develop new warnings. The representatives from Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson noted that the companies put warnings on their labels about an increased risk of stroke more than a year ago. The drug agency said it was considering adding the new warning to the older class of medicines "because limited data also suggest a similar increase in mortality for these drugs."</text></article></page></root>
