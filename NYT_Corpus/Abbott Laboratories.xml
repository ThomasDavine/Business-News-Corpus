The Illinois-based company is donating the time of dozens of workers with expertise in food sciences and engineering, in addition to $6.5 million cash, to build a charitable, self-sustaining nutrition enterprise in Haiti, the poorest country of the Western Hemisphere. On the central plateau of Haiti one day recently, 18 women sat in the shade hand-sorting peanuts in wide, flat baskets. “You know the misery we live in,” said one of them, Francilia Joseph. “I have six children at home. With this money, I’m able to send three of them to school.” Other workers roast the peanuts on gas stovetops, blend them in food processors with oil, powdered milk and vitamins, and spoon the sticky mix into plastic jars. The uniquely Haitian product, called Nourimanba, is an essential medicine for about 10,000 severely malnourished children a year. It is distributed to clinics by Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization that is the largest provider of health care services in rural Haiti. A few hundred yards away lies a roadway of rocks leading to an empty lot. Rising soon: an 18,000-square-foot manufacturing plant to produce the vitamin-enriched peanut butter on a much larger scale. In addition, some regular peanut butter may also be exported for sale to sustain the business. If Abbott can build an oasis of locally grown, nutritious food manufacturing in Haiti, it will be a little bit of green in a notoriously dark place, where it is difficult to make any real difference in people’s lives. “If you’re going to see a transformational change in a place like Haiti, it’s going to take a strategy beyond philanthropy,” said Katherine F. Pickus, Abbott’s divisional vice president for global citizenship and policy. “We saw this as an opportunity for Abbott to not only give its products, but its expertise as a nutrition business.” Even before the 2010 earthquake heaped more misery atop the poverty in Haiti, one in four children had stunted growth. An estimated 2.2 percent of Haitian children under the age of 5 had severe acute malnutrition, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund. Now it is worse. The quake killed 316,000, according to the government, and forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave the devastated capital city, Port-au-Prince, for the deeply impoverished plateau. Nourimanba is a high-calorie, high-protein, peanut-based paste that does not require mixing with water or refrigeration. It is a ready-to-use therapeutic food for severe malnutrition. “We’ve been producing locally grown therapeutic food since 2007,” said Joan VanWassenhove, associate coordinator for nutrition in Haiti for Partners in Health. “But Abbott’s involvement will help with quantity, as well as quality, and help with higher levels of food safety and sanitation standards. In our eyes, it’s going to be an astounding success.” As one small part of its work there, the health organization runs the Nourimanba operation near Corporant, about 30 miles north of Port-au-Prince. The group, affiliated with Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, was founded in 1987 to help Haiti. It has about 15,000 employees around the world. While the rudimentary production plant makes about 70 tons of Nourimanba for 10,000 children a year, the new one will push capacity to more than 350 tons and 50,000 children, the health group’s spokesman, Andrew Marx, said. Children receive it daily for six to eight weeks. The new operation will also expand on the 300 or so farmers who have a guaranteed market for their peanut crops. “An alternative to poverty and disease is to have a virtuous cycle of health, well-being and opportunity,” Mr. Marx said. “I’ve seen some children who are malnourished in my community receive Nourimanba,” one of the peanut farmers, Wesley Louis-Jean, said. “They regain their strength quickly with it. I’m happy to see that.” Abbott and its foundation previously worked with the health group in Malawi, Africa, to pay for a new clinic. “But this is a departure,” Ms. VanWassenhove said. “It’s not Abbott coming in and saying we have an idea we can do. It’s more like saying we want to take your vision and make it the best possible.” 1 2 Next Page » Ben Depp contributed reporting from Haiti.

After the split occurs, by the end of 2012, the medical device company is expected to have about $22 billion in annual sales, and Miles D. White, the current chairman and chief executive, will head up this company. It will retain the Abbott name. The pharmaceuticals company, which has yet to be named, will initially have about $18 billion in annual sales, and will be led by Richard A. Gonzalez, a longtime Abbott official. Mr. White cited shareholder value in making the announcement. Shares of Abbott rose 1.54 percent on Wednesday to $53.25. Stock analysts cheered the decision to create two companies to appeal to investors who want differing levels of risks and rewards. The pharmaceuticals business is generally higher risk and more focused on the United States than the devices piece. ''The split makes sense for stockholders who today want to invest in one line of business but not the other,'' said Richard M. Gordon, a pharmaceutical analyst and clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ''A split or spinoff of certain businesses has been a move that investors had hoped for, for some time, given the belief that Abbott's parts are worth more than the whole,'' said Rick Wise of Leerink Swann in New York. The deal is another chapter in the comeback story of Mr. Gonzalez, who in 2007 retired as Mr. White's No. 2, president and chief operating officer, with health problems. An Abbott spokesman said Mr. Gonzalez was healthy after recovering from a successful battle with throat cancer. Last year, he was chosen to run Abbott's global pharmaceuticals business. At the same time, Gimme Credit, a research firm for corporate bonds, said it was changing the outlook for Abbott to deteriorating from stable, a signal of a potential downgrade. ''Its financial aggressiveness had already soured us on the credit to some extent, and now with details of its spinoff vague, bondholders will be left in limbo for months,'' wrote Carol Levenson, director of research at the company. Some analysts questioned whether splitting the pharmaceutical business off to be sold to a pure-play pharmaceutical company was not the end game. After all, these analysts reasoned, Abbott's blockbuster drug Humira is poised this year to generate $8 billion of the proposed new company's $18 billion in annual sales. Yet Humira is also expected to face competition from cheaper so-called biosimilar versions of the drug by 2016. But Mr. White said Abbott was committed to remaining diverse, while the new company would be more like others that have shed nonpharmaceutical businesses with plans to profit from a strong pipeline of potential blockbuster drugs to drive sales. ''We have two long-term sustainable companies,'' Mr. White told analysts in a 90-minute conference call Wednesday morning. '' We have no interesting in selling. We're not looking to sell or merge it or anything else.'' Mr. White also said that a sale would result in substantial tax payments. The division of the companies, however, will result in a tax-free distribution to shareholders. Abbott said the deal should be completed by the end of next year. Other pharmaceutical companies have recently sold or spun off parts to increase share value and capital efficiency, in a cyclical development after years of mega-mergers. Bristol-Myers Squibb sold its baby formula company Mead Johnson Nutrition in 2009 and its medical device and wound care business Convatec core in 2008 to focus on pharmaceuticals. Pfizer is planning to sell its infant nutrition business, estimated to be worth as much as $10 billion, or to spin it off in a tax-free transaction. Pfizer has also announced plans to sell its animal health division. ''The status quo is not working; bigger is not better,'' Jami Rubin, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note in February. Abbott also announced Wednesday it was recording a $1.5 billion charge to cover a potential settlement stemming from a previously disclosed government investigation of accusations that it promoted its Depakote antiseizure drug for unauthorized uses.

The medical device company will have $22 billion in annual sales and be led by current Abbott chairman and chief executive Miles D. White and retain the Abbott name while the other company will have $18 billion in annual sales, which has yet to be named and be led by Richard A. Gonzalez, an Abbott veteran of three decades. “Today’s news is a significant event for Abbott, and reflects another dynamic change in our company’s 123-year history, strengthening our outlook for strong and sustainable growth and shareholder returns,” said Mr. White. Before he was named CEO in 1999, Mr. White, 56, ran the company’s diagnostics business, which will also be included in the Abbott device business. The company’s Ohio-based Ross nutritionals business, which sells Similac nutritional formula, will also be included in the device company. The deal is another chapter in the comeback story of Mr. Gonzalez, who in 2007 retired as Mr. White’s No. 2, president and chief operating officer, after recovering from a successful battle with throat cancer. Mr. Gonzalez returned to a venture investment arm that Abbott started in 2008. And last year, he was tapped to run Abbott’s global pharmaceuticals business. While acting as the second-in-command, Mr. Gonzalez headed the 2006 integration of Guidant Corp.’s vascular business, which Abbott bought for $4.1 billion. An Abbott spokesman said Mr. Gonzalez is healthy. “ I don’t think it could be in better hands,” Mr. White said of putting Mr. Gonzalez in charge of the new pharmaceutical company. Some analysts questioned whether splitting the pharmaceutical business off only to be sold to a pure-play pharmaceutical company wasn’t the end game. After all, these analysts reasoned, Abbott’s blockbuster drug Humira is poised this year to generate $8 billion of the proposed new company’s $18 billion in annual sales. Yet Humira is also expected to face competition from cheaper so-called “biosimilar” versions of the drug by 2016, threatening a drug that treats multiple autoimmune diseases and has grown by more than $1 billion a year in sales since its launch. But Mr. White said Abbott is committed to remaining diverse while the new company will be more like other companies that have shed non-pharmaceutical businesses but will operate fine on its own with a strong pipeline of potential blockbuster drugs to drive sales. “We have two long-term sustainable companies,” Mr. White told analysts investors on a 90-minute conference call Wednesday morning. “ We have no interesting in selling. We’re not looking to sell or merge it or anything else.” White also said a sale would result in substantial tax payments. The division of the companies, however, will result in a tax-free distribution to shareholders. Abbott said the deal should be completed by the end of next year. Wall Street analysts could hardly contain their glee over Abbott’s move when asking questions on the analysts call. “A split or spinoff of certain businesses has been a move that investors had hoped for, for some time, given the belief that Abbott’s parts are worth more than the whole,” said Rick Wise of Leerink Swann in New York. In 2004, Mr. White spun off Abbott’s hospital products division into what today is Hospira Incorporated, a maker of generic injectable drugs that has grown into a global company poised to make cheaper copies of biologics, a burgeoning business. While stock analysts cheered the announcement, a research firm for corporate bonds, Gimme Credit, said it was changing the outlook for Abbott to deteriorating from stable, a signal there could be a downgrade. The company said Abbott’s size and diversity had been key factors in its strong credit profile. “Its financial aggressiveness had already soured us on the credit to some extent, and now with details of its spinoff vague bondholders will be left in limbo for months,” Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, wrote. There were no questions from Wall Street on a day Abbott disclosed it was taking a $1.5 billion charge in the third quarter for a possible settlement related to the Justice Department’s investigation into allegations the company’s drug sales force improperly promoted the anti-seizure drug Depakote. In a statement, Abbott spokeswoman Melissa Brotz said the settlement talks with federal prosecutors “are ongoing, and until concluded, there can be no certainty about definitive resolution.” This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 19, 2011 An earlier version of this post misstated the name of an analyst for Leerink Swann.

As a result, uses of the drug, made by Abbott Laboratories, may be limited in the United States or be subject to more testing.The Food and Drug Administration is also considering whether to add data from the clinical trial to TriLipix’s prescribing information, the report said. Outside advisers to the agency will consider the proposed options at a meeting on Thursday in Silver Spring, Md. The review focuses on a study released in March 2010 comparing Abbott’s TriCor, an older version of TriLipix also known as fenofibrate, to the generic cholesterol pill simvastatin. New restrictions may jeopardize sales of TriLipix, which together with TriCor generated $1.58 billion last year, or 4.5 percent of Abbott’s revenue. “Since complete data were not available, it is difficult to definitively assess the safety profile of fenofibrate plus simvastatin versus simvastatin plus placebo,” the F.D.A. said in its staff report. The trial, named Accord, followed about 5,500 patients with Type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of developing heart disease, for an average of almost five years. Study results showed no significant reduction in the number of heart attacks, strokes and cardiac deaths in people taking TriCor along with simvastatin, compared with those taking simvastatin alone. The F.D.A. is asking its advisory panel to weigh several options: whether TriLipix should be withdrawn for use with a statin; continue to be used with a statin with data from the study added to the prescribing information; tested in a new study; or face no changes. TriLipix is the focus of the F.D.A.’s review because TriCor is not approved for use in combination with a statin treatment. About two-thirds of the study participants did not have high triglycerides and low levels of good cholesterol, two criteria for use in the drugs’ prescribing information, Jim Stolzenbach, head of cardiovascular development for Abbott, said in a telephone interview. Patients who met those criteria benefited from TriCor, he said. The trial was financed by the National Institutes of Health. The risk to Abbott will be minimized because TriCor is already expected to lose revenue when cheaper copies enter the market beginning in mid-2012, according to Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo in New York. He estimates that sales will fall to $990 million next year because of generic competition. Abbott said in October that about 30 percent of patients had switched from TriCor to TriLipix, a delayed-release version that was approved in 2008. Last year, Abbott abandoned efforts to win approval for Certriad, an experimental heart pill that combined TriLipix with Crestor, from AstraZeneca.A study has suggested that an anticholesterol drug, TriLipix, does not protect against heart attacks or strokes better than a generic medicine, according to a report released on Tuesday.

The judgment overturns a June 2009 ruling in favor of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biotech unit Centocor. “Centocor’s argument that an inventor need not physically make an invention to claim it misses the mark,” a panel of three circuit judges concluded. The president of Centocor, Robert Bazemore, said the company was “disappointed by the decision” and might appeal. “We are considering whether to ask for reconsideration by the panel or by the court of appeals as a whole,” he said in a statement. Humira posted global sales of $6.5 billion last year, and has long been Abbott’s best-selling product. It is approved to treat several serious immune system disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Johnson &amp; Johnson markets the rival treatments Simponi and Remicade, which are also injectable biotech drugs used to treat the conditions. The company claimed that Abbott had infringed a patent on a genetically engineered antibody that blocks an immune system response that stimulates inflammation. But the judges were not persuaded by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s claim to the technology, citing an earlier drug patent decision: “A ‘mere wish or plan’ for obtaining the claimed invention is not adequate to written description.” “We are very pleased with the appeals court’s decision,” Abbott said in a statement.WASHINGTON (AP) — Abbott Laboratories said a federal court of appeals overturned a $1.67 billion judgment against the company related to patents on its best-selling drug Humira, which were challenged by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/us/politics/07daley.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">William Daley Brings Management Experience as Chief of Staff<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — He is a top executive at JPMorgan Chase, where he is paid as much as $5 million a year and supervises the Washington lobbying efforts of the nation’s second-largest bank. He also serves on the board of directors at Boeing, the giant military contractor, and Abbott Laboratories, the global drug company, which has billions of dollars at stake in the overhaul of the health care system.And now William M. Daley, the son and brother of Chicago mayors and a behind-the-scenes political player himself, will hold one of the most powerful jobs in Washington: chief of staff in the White House, where he will help decide who gets into the Oval Office and what President Obama’s Capitol Hill agenda should be. Mr. Daley’s recruitment to Pennsylvania Avenue from the corporate boardroom is seen as a smart step by some in Washington, who argue that Mr. Obama has long needed a White House confidant who has the ear of the business community and a record of bipartisanship that might help the president negotiate with Republicans in Congress. “I think it’s a very, very strong choice,” said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has been a harsh critic of the Obama administration and provided financial support that helped Republicans take control of the House in the November elections. “Daley is a business person who understands politics.” Mr. Daley, or the corporations he has served in recent years, have worked aggressively behind the scenes to water down or defeat central elements of Mr. Obama’s agenda, opposing the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and elements of the health care bill. That record is among the reasons his appointment, announced by Mr. Obama on Thursday afternoon, has alarmed some of the president’s liberal supporters, who say that bringing Mr. Daley into the White House violates a commitment to curtail the sway of special interests. “As the chief of staff, he is the gatekeeper, and that means real power in Washington,” said Ellen S. Miller, co-founder of the Sunlight Foundation, which celebrated the move by Mr. Obama early in his presidency to release detailed logs of White House visitors and to impose restrictions on hiring lobbyists as aides. “Just about any way you look at it, it creates a huge potential for a conflict of interest.” The chief of staff job has sometimes been filled by corporate types, like Donald T. Regan, a top Wall Street executive and former Treasury secretary, who held the job in the Reagan administration. But more often, it goes to a political insider whose primary allegiance is to the president. Mr. Daley, 62, who is not close to Mr. Obama even though both consider Chicago their base, has a well-rounded résumé. He has been a lawyer in private practice, a bank president, a telecommunications company executive, a political strategist, a fund-raiser and campaign chief, a lobbyist for foreign corporations (he advocated on tax matters for Nestlé and a Canadian petroleum company) and the commerce secretary in the Clinton administration for three years. His brother, Richard M. Daley, is departing after six terms as mayor of Chicago, where his family has an almost royal status. Mr. Obama, during a ceremony in the East Room on Thursday, cited that long list of jobs as part of the reason he picked Mr. Daley. “Few Americans can boast the breadth of experience that Bill brings to this job,” the president said, adding that he was “convinced that he’ll help us in our mission of growing our economy and moving America forward.” JPMorgan Chase has been Mr. Daley’s primary corporate home since 2004. He was hired, company officials said, as something of consolation prize to Chicago when Chase, which has its headquarters in New York, was taking over Bank One, which was based in Chicago. Chase executives, including Jamie Dimon, its chairman, wanted to bring in someone with Chicago connections who could smooth over relations with wealthy clients and corporations there. One Chase official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter, recalled, “A few bankers said we should hire a Bill Daley,” meaning someone with Chicago political connections and clout who could serve as a new public face for Chase. Mr. Dimon’s response was simple: “How about Bill Daley?” Mr. Daley started as chairman of Chase’s Midwest operations, but by 2007 he had expanded his portfolio, joining the bank’s senior leadership team as chief of its new Office of Corporate Social Responsibility, whose most important function was to oversee the company’s global lobbying efforts. At the time, Chase was trying to raise its profile in Washington. Senior company executives, including Mr. Dimon, began taking more trips to the capital to try to influence the terms of the TARP bailout — they pushed to make it easier for banks to repay the money — in 2008. Last year, Chase officials fought aspects of the historic revision of the nation’s financial regulations, including the creation of the consumer protection bureau. Mr. Daley was never registered as a lobbyist for Chase, but he played a role in hiring and was the direct supervisor of Peter L. Scher, another former Clinton administration official, who runs the bank’s lobbying shop in Washington. Mr. Daley also served as the bank’s chief liaison with the White House, frequently consulting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, and Rahm Emanuel, whom he is replacing. Mr. Daley’s salary is not public, but one person with knowledge of Chase’s executive compensation said that he has made $3 million to $5 million a year. He will be taking a considerable pay cut in accepting the $170,000-a-year White House post. Boeing, which is also based in Chicago, named Mr. Daley to its board in 2006, saying that his appointment would enhance its lobbying efforts and help promote international sales of its commercial planes and military equipment. In 2009, he earned $230,000 from Boeing in compensation and stock awards and $220,867 from Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Labs, like Boeing and Chase, has a long list of regulatory and legislative matters in play in Washington, like a tax in the health care bill that could cost medical-device makers like Abbott $20 billion over the next decade. A White House chief of staff is likely to be involved in discussions about repealing the legislation, as House Republicans have proposed, or aspects of it. Critics of Mr. Daley’s appointment said his corporate work would cause problems. They argue that he will have to recuse himself from matters relating to Chase, Abbott and Boeing or bow out of discussions involving financial regulations, health care and major Defense Department acquisitions, like the contract for a giant Air Force refueling tanker for which Boeing is competing. “These are all issues that come across the chief of staff’s desk,” said James A. Thurber, an American University professor and specialist on ethics and lobbying in Washington. “Is he going to stand outside of the flow as each of them heads to the president? I don’t see that, and if he doesn’t, there will the perception, and maybe the reality, of a conflict of interest.” Others dismiss such concerns as unfounded, saying that Mr. Daley, who is to start his new job as early as next week, would not make decisions on policy and would hardly have sole power over who sees the president. Supporters of the appointment say Mr. Daley’s diversity of experience is exactly what Mr. Obama needs — an experienced manager who can serve as an intermediary for the White House with various constituencies whose support is critical to the president. David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president who is leaving the White House soon, said Mr. Obama thought hard before naming his new top aide. “The chief is the only one in the administration who has as broad a responsibility as the president, and he’s the one who’s ultimately accountable to the president,” Mr. Axelrod said in an interview. “It is a very, very serious and consequential decision.” Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

Two days later, an Abbott sales representative spent $2,159 to buy a whole, slow-smoked pig, peach cobbler and other fixings for a barbecue dinner at Dr. Midei’s home, according to a report being released Monday by the Senate. The dinner was just a small part of the millions in salary and perks showered on Dr. Midei for putting more stents in more patients than almost any other cardiologist in Baltimore. The Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare, started investigating Dr. Midei in February after a series of articles in The Baltimore Sun said that Dr. Midei at St. Joseph Medical Center, in Towson, Md., had inserted stents in patients who did not need them, reaping high reimbursements from Medicare and private insurance. The senators solicited 10,000 documents from Abbott and St. Joseph. Their report, provided in advance to The New York Times, concludes that Dr. Midei “may have implanted 585 stents which were medically unnecessary” from 2007 to 2009. Medicare paid $3.8 million of the $6.6 million charged for those procedures. The report also describes the close relationship between Dr. Midei and Abbott Labs, which paid consulting fees to the cardiologist after he left the hospital. “The serious allegations lodged against Dr. Midei regarding the medically unnecessary implantation of cardiac stents did not appear to deter Abbott’s interest in assisting him,” the report states. The case has turned into a legal quagmire for Dr. Midei and St. Joseph, which have been sued by hundreds of patients who claim they received unnecessary implants. Some doctors say the case has revealed a level of inappropriate care that is more common than most patients know. “What was going on in Baltimore is going on right now in every city in America,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who said he routinely treats patients who have been given multiple unneeded stents. “We’re spending a fortune as a country on procedures that people don’t need.” Dr. Midei’s lawyer, Stephen L. Snyder, said that his client’s treatment of his patients was entirely appropriate and that Dr. Midei, who has recently practiced medicine at the Prince Salman Heart Center in Saudi Arabia, would be exonerated. “This is all trumped up to hide the hospital’s criminal conduct,” said Mr. Snyder, who filed a $60 million lawsuit against St. Joseph on Dr. Midei’s behalf accusing the hospital of damaging Dr. Midei’s reputation by making false claims about his care. (The hospital responded that the assessments of Dr. Midei’s care were done by independent experts.) Last month, St. Joseph agreed to pay a $22 million fine to settle charges that it paid illegal kickbacks to Dr. Midei’s medical practice, MidAtlantic Cardiovascular Associates, in exchange for patient referrals; the hospital did not admit wrongdoing. St. Joseph said in a statement Friday that it now conducts monthly random reviews of stent cases “to assure such a situation cannot occur again.” As for Abbott Labs, a spokesman wrote in an e-mail that its affiliation with Dr. Midei ended early this year. “Dr. Midei has been a highly regarded physician in his field, with whom Abbott had consulted in the past,” said the spokesman, Jonathan Hamilton. “We have no further comment at this time.” The case has had wide repercussions. Over the past year, St. Joseph has told hundreds of Dr. Midei’s patients that they did not need the expensive and potentially dangerous stents that the doctor inserted because their arteries were not as obstructed as he had claimed. Now, state health officials are investigating other local cardiologists who inserted a suspiciously high number of stents, which are tiny wire mesh devices inserted to prop open clogged arteries in the heart. After reports about the Midei case and the wider state investigation, the number of stent procedures performed at St. Joseph and other area hospitals plunged, raising doubts about the appropriateness of much of the region’s cardiac care. A landmark 2007 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that many patients given stents would fare just as well without them. Dr. Christopher J. White, president-elect of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, said that inappropriate stenting was a problem, but a rare one. The federal Medicare program spent $3.5 billion last year on stent procedures. Prosecutors, malpractice lawyers and state medical boards are only now waking up to the issue. The Texas Medical Board last month accused a widely known cardiologist in Austin of inserting unnecessary stents. In September, federal prosecutors accused a cardiologist in Salisbury, Md., of performing unnecessary stent surgeries, and last year a Louisiana doctor was sentenced to 10 years in prison for inserting unneeded stents.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/health/policy/29drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Qnexa, a Diet Drug, Is Rejected by the F.D.A.<date>Published: October 28, 2010</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration rejected another new diet pill on Thursday, the latest setback in the quest to develop treatments for overweight Americans amid the nation’s obesity epidemic.The rejected drug, called Qnexa, is the third weight loss medicine to run into trouble this month because of concerns about safety. Last week, the F.D.A. declined to approve another new drug, lorcaserin, because it caused tumors in rats. And earlier in the month it forced the withdrawal of Meridia from the market after 13 years, citing the risk of heart attacks and strokes for certain patients. “It looks pretty bleak out there for anyone trying to get a drug approval for weight loss,” said Dr. Ken Fujioka, director of the center for weight management at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego. Vivus, the developer of Qnexa, said late Thursday in a statement on its Web site that the F.D.A. had requested that the company provide a thorough evaluation of the drug’s potential for causing birth defects and heart problems. The company, based in Mountain View, Calif., said it was confident it could provide this information to the F.D.A. in about six weeks. If the F.D.A. were to be satisfied, the drug could win approval sometime next year. There has been no new prescription diet pill approved since Roche’s Xenical in 1999. Xenical is now the only drug approved for long-term use in managing weight. “It’s tough to be a doctor and try to do something about the biggest problem in the U.S.,” said Dr. Fujioka, who is a consultant to some drug companies, including Vivus. Some drug companies shied away from the diet market, after part of the popular fen-phen diet combination was removed from the market in 1997 because it damaged heart valves. The debacle resulted in huge legal settlements. The F.D.A.’s decision on Qnexa was not unexpected, given that an advisory committee to the agency had voted 10 to 6 against approval in July. But it is nonetheless disappointing to some specialists because Qnexa produced about twice as much weight loss as other diet pills. In clinical trials, patients on the highest dose of Qnexa lost an average of 10.6 percent of their weight after one year, compared with 1.7 percent for those taking a placebo. Qnexa is a combination of two existing drugs — phentermine, a stimulant that is approved for short-term use as a weight loss drug, and topiramate, an epilepsy and migraine drug sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson under the name Topamax. An F.D.A. advisory committee in December will consider another diet drug, called Contrave, developed by Orexigen Therapeutics. But if that one also is not approved, some experts say it would discourage already wary pharmaceutical companies from working on drugs for obesity. “It’s going to put the brakes on all obesity drug development for a decade,” said Dr. W. Timothy Garvey, chairman of the department of nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who was an investigator in the clinical trials of Qnexa. Morgan Downey, an advocate for obese people who also consults for pharmaceutical companies, said the F.D.A. appeared to believe that a very effective drug would be used so much that unanticipated side effects would show up, while less effective drugs were not worth any risk. “The F.D.A. has gotten itself into a real knot,” said Mr. Downey, who describes himself as obese and edits the Downey Obesity Report Web site. “They can’t approve a very effective drug and they can’t approve a modest drug.” The F.D.A. does not comment or publicly release its reasons for turning down a drug. Dr. John Jenkins, director of the agency’s office of new drugs, told reporters this month that the agency was “committed to working toward approval” of new obesity drugs, “so long as they are safe and effective for the population for which they are intended.” Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women and Families, said the diet drugs that have made it to market are not very effective, so the F.D.A. should pay close attention to safety. “The vast majority of people taking them don’t stay on them long enough to get any health benefit,” she said. About a third of Americans are obese and another third merely overweight. Obesity contributes to many other health problems like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. So an effective diet pill could help cut medical costs over all and should, at least in theory, become a blockbuster. “This is the biggest field, bigger than statins potentially,” Jack Lief, chief executive of Arena Pharmaceuticals, the developer of lorcaserin, said a year ago, referring to the popular cholesterol-lowering drugs like Lipitor. Yet no diet pill has ever become a true blockbuster. COmbined sales of all prescription obesity drugs in the United States have been falling over the last few years and totaled only $154 million in 2009, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/health/09drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott Labs Withdraws Meridia From Market<date>Published: October 8, 2010</date><text>The diet drug Meridia is being withdrawn from the market because it can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.Abbott Laboratories, the drug’s manufacturer, said on Friday that it was taking the action voluntarily but under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration. “Meridia’s continued availability is not justified when you compare the very modest weight loss that people achieve on this drug to their risk of heart attack or stroke,” Dr. John Jenkins, director of the office of new drugs at the F.D.A., said in a statement. F.D.A. officials said the estimated 100,000 Americans using Meridia should stop taking the drug and consult with their doctors. The withdrawal of Meridia, also known as sibutramine, is the latest setback in efforts to provide a safe medicine to treat obesity, one of the nation’s largest health problems. In 1997, part of the fen-phen diet pill combination was removed from the market after it was found to damage heart valves. The withdrawal of Meridia is not expected to seriously hurt Abbott, though it could conceivably expose the company to lawsuits from patients. Sales of Meridia, which have been dwindling over the years, were only $80 million globally, with $20 million of that from the United States, in the first nine months of this year, Abbott said in a regulatory filing Friday. The company said it would take a charge against earnings in the third quarter but was maintaining its earnings forecast for the quarter and the year. It said it was also taking the drug off the market in Canada and was in discussions with regulators in other countries. Its shares rose 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $52.81 on Friday. The F.D.A.’s action stems from the results of a clinical trial involving more than 10,000 patients that were announced late last year. In that trial, 11.4 percent of people who took Meridia suffered a heart attack, stroke or other major cardiac problem, compared with 10 percent of those taking a placebo — a 16 percent increase in relative risk. The trial, which had been requested by European regulators, found that those on the drug lost only about 2.5 percentage points of their weight more than those on the placebo. Abbott maintains that the results are not relevant because most people in that trial had cardiovascular disease, and such people are not supposed to take the drug. For the proper patients, the drug is safe, the company says. Still, European regulators took the drug off the market in January. The F.D.A. convened an advisory committee on Sept. 15. Half the members recommended withdrawal. The other members said the drug should remain on the market but with stronger warnings and possible restrictions in use. Dr. Jenkins told reporters Friday that the agency opted for withdrawal because “there was no identifiable population of patients for whom the benefits of Meridia outweighed its risks.” He said he did not think Meridia users would have any residual increased risk once they stopped taking the drug. Meridia has been controversial since its approval in 1997 because it raises blood pressure and heart rate. The F.D.A. advisory panel at that time recommended against approval. And in 2005, the F.D.A. turned down a request from the consumer group Public Citizen to take the drug off the market. One reason given was that the agency wanted to wait for the results of the clinical trial that is now the basis for the withdrawal. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of health research at Public Citizen, said in a statement Friday that the F.D.A.’s decision to request withdrawal now was “commendable but dangerously too late.” He said that since his group filed its petition in 2002, more than three million prescriptions had been filled for Meridia, “with many patients inevitably having had heart attacks or strokes.” The withdrawal leaves Roche’s Xenical as the only prescription weight-loss drug approved for long-term use. The generic stimulant phentermine, the most widely used drug, is approved only for short-term use. A low-dose version of Xenical, called Alli, is available without a prescription. The F.D.A. is expected to decide this month whether to approve two new obesity drugs — lorcaserin from Arena Pharmaceutics and Qnexa from Vivus. Both drugs received negative recommendations from an F.D.A. advisory committee. The F.D.A. on Friday also warned consumers to avoid using Slimming Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules, a nutritional supplement sold over the Internet. The agency said the capsules contained excessive amounts of sibutramine, the main ingredient in Meridia.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/business/global/22abbott.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott Plans to Cut 3,000 Jobs<date>Published: September 21, 2010</date><text>Abbott Laboratories said Tuesday that it planned to cut 3,000 jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force, after its purchase of Solvay’s pharmaceuticals business.The cuts will take place over the next two years and most will come from Solvay positions, an Abbott spokesman, Scott Stoffel, said. The layoffs will include reductions in research and development, commercial, manufacturing and other staff functions, Mr. Stoffel said. Abbott, which has about 93,000 employees, will also close the former United States headquarters of Solvay’s pharmaceuticals unit in Marietta, Ga., by the end of 2011. About 500 positions at a site in Weesp, the Netherlands, also will be eliminated, as will 300 jobs in Hanover, Germany. The job cuts are part of “a series of recent strategic announcements designed to position Abbott’s pharmaceutical business for sustained and future growth,” Mr. Stoffel said. Abbott plans to take pretax charges of about $810 million to $970 million over the next two years related to the overhaul. It also expects one-time costs of about $135 million in the second half of this year and $175 million next year related to integrating Solvay. Abbott completed its $6.2 billion deal for the Solvay drugs unit in February, giving Abbott full control of its Belgian partner’s cholesterol treatments and further involvement in emerging markets. Abbott expects to treat the various costs as specified items, and therefore it will not affect its 2010 profit forecast.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/health/17drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Diet Drug From Arena Rejected by F.D.A. Panel<date>Published: September 16, 2010</date><text>A federal advisory panel on Thursday recommended against approval of a new diet pill, the latest setback in efforts to develop treatments for the nation’s obesity epidemic. The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted 9 to 5 that the potential benefits of the drug, called lorcaserin and developed by Arena Pharmaceuticals, did not outweigh the risks. The vote indicated how tough it might be to win approval for obesity drugs. Some committee members said lorcaserin was not clearly unsafe. But even a mere suggestion of possible risks seemed unacceptable to some panel advisers because the drug did not help people lose much weight. “I really didn’t have a lot of issues with the risk,” said one panel member, Dr. Eric I. Felner, a diabetes expert at Emory University. Still, he voted no. “I just didn’t see it as being that efficacious.” The negative vote is the second setback this year in attempts to win approval for what would be the first new prescription weight-loss drug in more than a decade. Citing safety concerns, the same committee voted 10 to 6 in July against approval for the drug Qnexa from Vivus, a drug that produced a much greater weight loss among trial participants than lorcaserin. The F.D.A., which usually takes the advice of its committees, is expected to decide next month whether to approve lorcaserin or Qnexa. On Wednesday, the advisory panel split 8 to 8 on whether the diet drug Meridia, sold by Abbott Laboratories, should be removed from the market. A study showed that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with cardiovascular risk. The drug has already been removed from the market in Europe. Some doctors who treat obesity testified in favor of the drug at Thursday’s meeting, which was held in Adelphi, Md. They said there was an urgent need for new diet drugs, given that a third of American adults are obese and another third overweight. There is hope that drugs that help people lose weight would also mitigate some of the health problems linked to obesity, like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Yet the F.D.A. has become safety-conscious in this area since the drugs could potentially be taken for years by millions of people, and because of highly publicized health concerns associated with some previously popular diet prescriptions, like Meridia and the so-called fen-phen combination that damaged heart valves. Lorcaserin mimics the effect of the brain chemical serotonin and has an effect on suppressing appetite. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of fenfluramine, the part of the fen-phen regimen that was pulled from the market. Arena, which is based in San Diego, said its drug was developed to work in the brain and not the heart. In its clinical trials, those who took the drug did not have a significantly higher rate of valve problems than those who got a placebo. The F.D.A. said, however, that statistically the company could not totally rule out an increased risk of up to 50 percent. The biggest safety issue for the committee seemed to be the finding of tumors in rats that had received high doses of the drug. Arena argued that those findings would not apply to people. In the clinical trials, there was no increase in cancer rates among people who took the drug. For the committee, even though the safety issues were not considered so bad, they were measured against an efficacy that was not too good. The drug met only one of the two F.D.A. standards for weight loss drugs, and it did so only by what the F.D.A. termed a “slim margin.” Those taking the drug lost 5.8 percent of their weight after a year, compared to 2.5 percent for those getting a placebo. The difference, 3.3 percentage points, is below the 5 percentage point criterion set by the F.D.A. However, 47 percent of those taking lorcaserin lost at least 5 percent of their weight, compared to 22 percent of those getting a placebo. That just exceeded the F.D.A. standard that twice as many people on the drug as on the placebo lose 5 percent of their weight. Those who took the drug in the trial had modest improvements in risk measures like blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar compared with those who got the placebo, but the significance seemed unclear to the committee. “The argument that there is an urgent need I don’t think really mitigates the concern of putting a drug that doesn’t do much and may do harm on the market,” said Dr. Pamela S. Douglas, professor of research in cardiovascular diseases at Duke and a committee member. No patients who used the drug in clinical trials testified to the committee for its approval. And some advocacy groups for women or overweight people said the drug was not ready for approval. Jack Lief, the chief executive of Arena, said in a statement after the meeting that the company believed that lorcaserin “has a positive benefit-risk profile.” If approved, lorcaserin would be Arena’s first product, and it would be marketed by part of the Japanese drug company Eisai. Trading in Arena’s stock was halted on Thursday. But after hours, the stock price fell about 40 percent. But shares of Orexigen Therapeutics, which has a diet pill that will be discussed by the committee in December, rose 38 percent. Investors apparently believe that Orexigen now has the best shot of approval. Of course, after Vivus’s drug was rejected by the advisory committee in July, it was Arena’s shares that rose sharply as investors bet that it had the best shot.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/health/policy/16abbott.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Federal Panel Split on Ban of Meridia<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>ADELPHI, Md. (Reuters) — A federal advisory panel was divided Wednesday over whether to recommend banning a weight-loss drug made by Abbott Laboratories, although a majority agreed that the drug’s heart risk cast a shadow on its future use. Eight of the 16 members of the Food and Drug Administration’s panel of outside advisers urged withdrawing the drug, Meridia, saying the potential for heart attacks and stroke outweighed any benefits of minor weight loss. Six urged restricted sales and strong “black box” warning, while two others said the warning and patient monitoring were enough. The move places the fate of Meridia, which is expected to generate $30 million in domestic sales this year, with the F.D.A., which will weigh the panel’s advice when making a final decision.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/health/research/02diet.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Study Sees Heart Risk in Meridia Diet Pill<date>Published: September 1, 2010</date><text>A clinical trial of Meridia, a controversial diet pill, in nearly 10,000 overweight or obese older patients over many years found that the drug increased the risks of heart attacks and strokes while doing little to slim their waists.The study was paid for by Abbott Laboratories, Meridia’s maker, and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. And the authors of the study, three of whom are Abbott employees, concluded that the trial results did little more than show that patients with heart problems should not be prescribed Meridia — a restriction already included in Meridia’s label. But in an unusual rebuke, The Journal’s top editors wrote an editorial concluding that the study actually showed that Meridia, also known as sibutramine, should be removed from the market. “It wasn’t that we disagreed with the interpretation of the authors,” said Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, The Journal’s executive editor. “It’s just that we thought they didn’t quite go far enough.” Many patients, Dr. Curfman added, “have cardiovascular disease and don’t know it. How are you supposed to identify those patients who might be put at risk by putting them on drugs like sibutramine?” After seeing preliminary results of the trial in January, the European Medicines Agency ordered Abbott to remove Meridia from the European market. The Food and Drug Administration took a less forceful step and instead requested that Abbott state on the drug’s label that Meridia should not be used in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The agency will ask a committee of experts on Sept. 15 whether further steps are needed. Dr. David J. Graham, a drug-safety official at the F.D.A., said the agency’s decision to allow continued marketing of Meridia was mistaken and resulted because officials who approved the drug remain in charge of assessing its safety. “This once again emphasizes the need for a separate center to oversee the safety of presently marketed drugs,” Dr. Graham said. Karen Riley, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency had been aware of most of the trial’s findings since last year and issued a public warning on Nov. 20. In the study, called the Scout trial, 10,744 overweight or obese patients with a mean age of 63 and histories of cardiovascular problems were all given Meridia for six weeks. Patients who showed immediate problems on the drug were dropped from the study, and the 9,804 remaining were given either Meridia or a placebo for the remainder of the study. Patients on Meridia lost about nine pounds in the first year; those who received placebos lost about four pounds. The Meridia patients suffered 28 percent more heart attacks and 36 percent more strokes, although there was no difference in heart-related deaths. Scott Davies, an Abbott spokesman, described Meridia “as an important option to treat a serious condition for which there are few treatments available.” Dr. W. Philip T. James, a professor of nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the lead author of the study, said that Meridia was beneficial for many obese people without heart problems. Dr. James dismissed the editorial that attacked his study’s conclusions. He was paid by Abbott to conduct the study, and his co-authors disclosed a dizzying array of research and marketing relationships with drug companies. “I think the editors are cavalier in their approach in basing their decision on statistics and not looking at it in clinical terms,” Dr. James said in an interview. Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia University, said in an interview that the Meridia dispute revolved around an argument between those who viewed drugs from a population basis and those who viewed them from an individual patient basis. A small number of patients lose considerable weight while taking Meridia and therefore benefit enormously from the drug, Dr. Leibel said. But a far larger number of people get no benefit from the drug, and some of these patients may suffer heart attacks and strokes as a result of taking it. “The question is do you withdraw the drug to protect the large number of individuals who have no benefit and could have a bad response and thereby eliminate the opportunity for that small number of people who respond well?” Dr. Leibel asked. It is a dilemma often faced by the F.D.A. in part because the agency has no power over how doctors use medicines. Even when agency officials warn against the use of drugs in certain patients, some doctors prescribe them dangerously anyway and patients die. In some cases, the agency has forced drugs off the market after some doctors have proven unable to prescribe them safely. In other cases, the F.D.A. has only strengthened warnings — particularly when the injuries associated with the drug’s use are common problems like heart attacks and strokes that in individual patients are difficult to blame the medicine for. Meridia’s safety woes and modest efficacy are part of a long history of disappointing efforts by the drug industry to cure the obesity epidemic and cash in on the estimated $59 billion that Americans spend annually fighting fat. Xenical, another diet drug made by Roche, can cause flatulence and oily discharges. A federal advisory panel voted in July against endorsing Qnexa, an experimental fat pill developed by Vivus. And highly promoted scientific efforts to control appetite through leptin, a hormone involved in appetite and metabolism, and through suppression of appetite receptors activated by marijuana have so far failed.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/business/global/22drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott Buys Drug Maker in India for $3.7 Billion<date>Published: May 21, 2010</date><text>NEW DELHI — Abbott Laboratories said Friday that it would purchase the Indian drug maker Piramal Healthcare for $3.7 billion, increasing its presence in the fast-growing emerging markets and its portfolio of low-priced drugs.Piramal, based in Mumbai, makes generic and branded drugs in nine plants in India, Britain and Canada, and has the largest sales force in India with more than 6,000 representatives. The company’s net profit increased 52 percent in the last fiscal year, to 4.8 billion rupees ($103 million). Abbott said Friday that it would pay $2.12 billion in cash upfront for Piramal, and then $400 million annually over the next four years. The deal will add immediately to Abbott’s earnings, executives said. Drug sales are growing quickly in emerging markets in part because of better diagnosis and an increase in diseases associated with higher incomes, like diabetes and obesity. Emerging markets will account for 30 to 40 percent of pharmaceutical sales growth in the next 10 years, estimates PricewaterhouseCoopers. In India, drug sales are expected to hit $8 billion this year and double by 2015. “Emerging markets represent one of the greatest opportunities in health care,” the chairman and chief executive of Abbott, Miles D. White, said. The deal is one of several he has taken to reshape the company and grow outside the United States. Emerging markets already make up more than 20 percent of Abbott’s overall business, Mr. White said. A number of brand-name drug companies have been doing deals recently with Indian generic makers. In 2008, the Japanese drug maker, Daiichi Sankyo, bought a majority share in Ranbaxy for about $4.6 billion. GlaxoSmithKline has an alliance with Dr. Reddy’s, and Pfizer has a distribution deal with several India generics makers including Aurobindo. The pharmaceutical business in emerging markets is profoundly different from the West. Consumers in emerging markets often pay directly for their prescriptions, rather than relying on insurance or government care, and generic drugs are the biggest sellers. At the same time that big drug makers in the United States and Europe are pursuing high-growth emerging markets, they are under pressure to cut costs to consumers in the West. Drug makers’ “entire focus globally is going to be cost-effectiveness,” said Sujay Shetty, India pharmaceutical leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Government policy makers from the United States and Europe are concentrating on lowering health care costs, and drug companies that once dismissed generic drugs are now getting into the market, he said. Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., has tried to grow in Russia, China, Brazil and other emerging markets, and to expand its roster of generic drugs. The company said last September that it would buy Solvay Pharmaceuticals of Belgium, which has a big emerging market presence, for $6.6 billion. “You have to look at the United States and the developed markets cautiously,” Mr. White said. The environment is “difficult” he said and health care reform has put a “dent” in the industry. Piramal is part of a conglomerate that also makes glass and invests in real estate. The drug company, which is nearly 50 percent owned by the conglomerate’s founding family, has done 15 acquisitions since 1988, including a deal for the British division of Rhodia and Pfizer’s manufacturing plant in northeast England. Piramal does so-called contract manufacturing and research for other drug companies in low-cost laboratories in India, as well as making 350 different branded generic drugs. When Piramal’s operations in India are combined with Abbott’s existing business here, the company will become the largest drug company in India with 7 percent of the market, company executives said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/abbott-in-3-7-billion-deal-for-piramal-unit-in-india/?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott in $3.7 Billion Deal for Piramal Unit in India<date>May 21, 2010, 6:54 am</date><text>Abbott Laboratories will pay $3.72 billion to acquire India’s Piramal Healthcare‘s pharmaceutical solutions business, as global drugmakers look to boost their presence in emerging markets, Reuters reported. Takeover speculation had swirled around Piramal, with media reports highlighting Sanofi-Aventis, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline as possible buyers. Abbott said it will pay $2.12 billion up-front and make annual payments of $400 million for the next four years, beginning in 2011. The company, based in the United States, said the deal will make it the largest drugmaker in India. Global demand for generic drugs from Indian drugmakers such as Ranbaxy Laboratories and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, the top two players by sales, and local rival Cipla, is booming as governments battle rising health care costs. Emerging markets, where cheaper generic medicines form the bedrock of sales, are the new battleground for the world’s top drugmakers as sales stall in Western markets.

Under the terms of the deal, Abbott will pay $27 for each Facet share, a 67 percent premium over Facet’s closing price of $16.21 on Tuesday. Facet’s shares jumped slightly above Abbott’s offer in after-hours trading, gaining $10.89, or 67.2 percent, to $27.10, in a sign that investors are hoping for a higher bid. In December, Facet rejected an unsolicited offer of $17.50 a share from Biogen Idec, its partner in developing the drug daclizumab for treating multiple sclerosis, saying the bid undervalued the company. Biogen Idec had no immediate comment on Abbott’s offer. Abbott said that the total purchase price was about $722 million, but that this amount included about $272 million in Facet’s projected cash and marketable securities that it would acquire at the time of the deal’s closing. “This acquisition will further strengthen Abbott’s biologics capabilities and pharmaceutical pipeline,” John Leonard, Abbott’s senior vice president for global pharmaceutical research and development, said in a statement. “Daclizumab is a promising treatment for multiple sclerosis, a disease that has a significant unmet medical need, and has the potential to become an important treatment option for patients.” Facet showed that it felt vindicated in turning down Biogen Idec’s offer last year. “We believe this transaction provides full and fair value for our stockholders and validates the potential of Facet’s clinical and technology assets,” Faheem Hasnain, Facet’s president and chief executive, said in the statement.

The raw data from the study indicated that people with certain health problems who took the prescription diet drug Meridia had more heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems than people getting a placebo. On Thursday, the European Medicines Agency advised doctors and pharmacists to stop prescribing and dispensing European equivalents of Meridia. The Food and Drug Administration, looking at the same study data on Thursday, took a less forceful step and asked Abbott Laboratories, the maker of Meridia, to put a stronger warning on its label. The F.D.A. said the new warning should indicate that the drug was not to be used by people who have a history of heart attacks or strokes, or who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Abbott, which sells Meridia in Europe under various brand names, including Reductil and Ectiva, indicated Friday that it would comply with the F.D.A.'s labeling request and with the European advisory by suspending sales of the drugs in Europe. Meridia contains the ingredient sibutramine, which works by increasing neurotransmitter activity in the brain, helping people to feel full after a meal and thereby reducing their food intake. The company said the drug was safe and effective when used in appropriate patients. ''We believe there are many patients who benefit from sibutramine,'' Dr. Eugene Sun, vice president for global pharmaceutical research and development at Abbott, said in a statement. The company's global sales of sibutramine drugs last year were about $300 million, although usage in the United States has been declining for years. The study, called the Scout trial, is important for the field of obesity as a whole because its findings contradict what has been the long-held presumption -- that weight-loss drugs are more than just cosmetic. The presumption has been that they will actually help reduce the serious health problems, like heart disease, that are associated with obesity. The Scout study was the first to actually test this presumption, to see if a diet drug could reduce the risks of heart attacks. Some experts said the finding that Meridia actually increased such risk in some high-risk patients rather than reduce it could raise questions about the safety of other diet drugs. The findings might also raise the safety hurdle for new obesity drugs to win approval. However, some experts said the problems might be unique to Meridia, which clearly raises blood pressure and heart rate. In any case, the significantly different actions by the two health authorities is stirring debate among drug makers and consumer advocates. Did the European agency act too quickly on a set of preliminary data -- or was it moving more forcefully to defend consumer health than its American counterpart? ''The European Medicines Agency has acted appropriately,'' said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, the director of the health research group at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. His group has long asked the F.D.A. to ban Meridia, including a petition last month saying that in the drug's 12 years on the market it has been linked to more than 80 deaths, including 30 people under age 50. ''The F.D.A. has acted recklessly,'' Dr. Wolfe said. But Dr. Louis J. Aronne, director of the comprehensive weight control program at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, said he did not think the drug was unsafe for people who did not already have heart disease. He said he agreed with the F.D.A.'s decision. ''Running up the hill might increase your risk of having a heart attack if you have coronary disease,'' said Dr. Aronne, who is a consultant to various pharmaceutical companies, but not Abbott. ''But if you are 23 years old and have no coronary disease, then running up the hill can prevent you from getting heart disease.'' The European Medicines Agency had requested the study in 2002 because of concerns about side effects like higher blood pressure. The company gave preliminary results from that study to European and American regulators late last year.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/business/29sorkin.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Big Merger Deals Signal Restored Confidence<date>Correction: September 30, 2009Published: September 28, 2009</date><text>The corner office is getting a bit more bullish about the economy. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Norm Betts/Bloomberg News John Chambers, chief of Cisco Systems, says the company will be making acquisitions. Add to Portfolio Abbott Laboratories Xerox Corp Cisco Systems Inc Affiliated Computer Services Incorporated Warner Chilcott Ltd Go to your Portfolio » While investors have been bidding up shares in the stock market for months, many chief executives and boards had privately remained skittish about their own businesses  until recently. In a signal that confidence  and perhaps a bit of executive swagger  may be returning to the business world, two large mergers were announced on Monday, adding to a flurry of deals in the last month. First, Abbott Laboratories, the drug maker, agreed to acquire a unit of Solvay of Belgium for $6.6 billion, and then Xerox agreed to buy Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcer, for $6.4 billion. Neither merger compares in size to the double-digit billion-dollar deals that took place just two years ago at the height of the buyout boom. But taken in the context of what has been a merger drought  in the wake of the financial crisis, deal-making is still off by more than 50 percent from last year  the transactions suggest that the most senior ranks of corporate America may now have a more optimistic outlook on the economy than some people thought. “Will you see us move with a lot of acquisitions over this next year? You betcha,” John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said in a recent meeting. “Especially if it plays out economically the way that I think.” For nearly two years, mergers plunged along with the markets as executives grappled with trying to understand how best to survive. At this time in 2007, $1.28 trillion in takeovers in the United States had been announced; so far this year, only $491.8 billion have been announced, according to Thomson Reuters. And with stock prices fluctuating sharply after falling for many months until the spring, buyers were anxious about overpaying and sellers were nervous about shortchanging themselves. But as the markets have rebounded and leveled off, companies are more confident about their prospects, so they are dipping their toes into the deal waters. The takeovers, in turn, helped lift the stock market on Monday, which had stalled recently. “The psychology has changed. This is sign that things have stabilized,” said Boon Sim, Credit Suisse’s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, who suggested that deals were a lagging indicator to the stock market. “I don’t think the floodgates are opening up,” he continued, “but C.E.O.’s are now beginning to say, ‘If I don’t buy it now, it’s only going to get more expensive in the next 12 or 18 months.’ ” What Wall Street hasn’t seen, of course, is the return of the biggest buyers in recent years  the private equity firms that propelled much of the merger mania during the debt-fueled bubble. And that may be good news. The big deals announced recently are strategic deals, in which one company buys another to make it an integral part of its business, and they do not require the buyer to take on mounds of new borrowing to pay for the acquisition. In contrast, many of the takeovers for the last five years were based on little more than financial engineering, with lax lenders providing low-interest debt to help private equity firms buy companies that they often planned to resell quickly in hopes of pocketing a fast profit. That has left many companies struggling to make interest payments, making it harder for them to invest in new products or more efficient manufacturing methods. A number of those takeovers are already underwater and some have turned sour. Just one example: Simmons, the mattress maker, was bought by the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, or THL, in 2003, largely with borrowed money. Last week, THL said that Simmons  whose immense debt burden from the takeover was hampering its prospects  would be put into bankruptcy proceedings and sold. But the sale price for Simmons is so low that bond investors will lose around $500 million. At Xerox, Ursula M. Burns, the company’s chief executive, said that she pursued the deal for Affiliated Computer Services only because she finally felt more comfortable with the performance of her own business. “We’re confident that our base business will rebound when the economy does  and in Q2 saw the right trends in this direction,” she said. “So, all factors played to our favor. At the end of the day, in tough times, strong companies look to invest in their future.” While the recent mergers may represent a positive sign for the economy, Alexander Roos, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, is less inclined to believe that we are about to see a burst of activity. In a study to be published on Tuesday, he said, his analysis of a sample of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index shows that about 20 percent are “predators,” ready to take on the risks of a deal, while another 20 percent are “prey.” “We expect a window of opportunity offering attractive takeover prospects to open soon,” Mr. Roos said. “We have already seen some of our smarter clients making preparations in recent months.” The greatest concentration of deal-making appears to be in the health care and technology sectors. Warner Chilcott made a $3.1 billion deal for Procter &amp; Gamble’s drug business last month, for example, and Dell bought Perot Systems, a technology services company, for $3.9 billion. But deals are also being made in other sectors, like food; Kraft’s $16.7 billion unsolicited bid for Cadbury, which was rejected but remains a possibility, is the largest outstanding offer to date. “If you’re healthy, it’s a great time to acquire inexpensively,” adds Ted Rouse, a head of Bain &amp; Company’s global mergers and acquisitions practice. “But it’s an awful time for two weak companies to merge.” While the return of corporate mergers may be a good sign for the economy, a bigger question may be whether it is such a good thing for companies. Most deals sound great at the time, but in the end, not all of them work out as well as planned. Mr. Rouse said, “Before the recession, Bain’s research on M.&amp;A. showed that approximately 55 percent of acquisitions failed to deliver expected shareholder returns after one year  worse than flipping a coin. The odds only get worse as the size of the acquisition increases and the target is further from the acquirer’s core business.” Let’s hope the odds are better this time around.

The deal, set at 4.5 billion euros, also includes a provision for up to 300 million additional euros, or $440 million at Friday's exchange rate, in future payments that would be linked to product milestones from 2011 to 2013, the people said. In acquiring Solvay's pharmaceuticals business, Abbott, based near Chicago, will take sole possession of the TriCor cholesterol pill, which it was sharing with Solvay and had more than $1.3 billion in sales for Abbott last year. Abbott will also acquire sole rights to Trilipix, a new cholesterol treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration last December and marketed as TriCor's successor. Abbott will also acquire Solvay's drugs for hypertension, hormone replacement and neurological and other conditions. While most of the world's mergers-and-acquisitions business has been dormant during the recession -- until recent signs of life like Walt Disney's $4 billion purchase of Marvel Entertainment and Kraft Foods' unsolicited bid for Cadbury -- cash-rich drug makers have been on buying sprees this year. That includes Pfizer's $68 billion deal for Wyeth in January, a deal that helped break a logjam of possibilities stalled by the credit freeze. In March, Merck paid $41 billion to acquire Schering Plough, and Roche paid $47 billion to buy the remainder of Genentech. For Abbott, the Solvay deal is but one of a series of deals this year. And other potential buyers in the hunt for acquisitions include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Eli Lilly and Company, according to a Sept. 17 report by analysts at Credit Suisse. Pending health care legislation in Congress is not considered a deterrent for pharmaceutical acquisitions, because the drug makers are expected to do well in whatever emerges from Washington. The industry has a potentially winning political argument that its drugs prevent disease and save medical costs. And the industry stands to benefit from the addition of tens of millions of Americans to the ranks of the insured, under a health care overhaul. Solvay put its drug business up for sale this year. The unit last year accounted for 28 percent of Solvay's billion euros in revenue. Although the drug revenues have helped fill gaps in Solvay's chemicals and plastic businesses through the recession, analysts say the company is now looking to expand in other core areas, probably chemicals. Abbott outbid Nycomed of Switzerland for Solvay's drug business. Abbott had been rumored since July to be a potential acquirer. On Sunday, Solvay set a press conference for 10:30 a.m. Brussels time on Monday (4:30 a.m. New York time). Abbott had sales of $29.5 billion last year and $5.2 billion in profit, not counting one-time items. Its top product is the arthritis drug Humira, with $4.5 billion in sales. But future growth projections for other big Abbott products are potentially more challenging, analysts say, with patents expiring on TriCor in 2011, and in 2013 for the cholesterol fighter Niaspan and the prostate cancer drug Lupron. The H.I.V. treatment Kaletra loses patent protection in 2016. David S. Moskowitz, an analyst for Caris and Company, said the deal would be a good fit for both companies. ''It makes sense,'' he said on Sunday. The price, slightly less than double last year's revenues for Solvay drugs, indicates that Solvay's drug business was relatively mature without a lot of growth potential, Mr. Moskowitz added. ''It's a reasonable price,'' he said. Catherine J. Arnold, senior pharmaceuticals analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote to investors on Friday to say an Abbott-Solvay deal would add to Abbott's earnings, but that it was ''more like financial engineering'' by using cash to buy revenues. The deal, she wrote, would increase Abbott's bet on the cholesterol pills even as TriCor's patent is about to expire and the company faces challenges getting patients to switch to Trilipix. Further, Ms. Arnold wrote, it would fail to diversify Abbott's product line much beyond Humira, which is expected to contribute 35 percent of the company's sales growth the next three years. In Ms. Arnold's opinion, Abbott would be better off pursuing ''strategic assets that would provide more access to innovation.'' She cited Alexion Pharmaceuticals and BioMarin Pharmaceutical as worthy targets. The Solvay purchase would be the latest in a series of Abbott acquisitions this year. Two earlier deals focused on eye care companies: Advanced Medical Optics for about $2.8 billion in cash and assumed debt in January, and this month, Abbott said it would buy Visiogen for $400 million cash. Abbott also announced the purchases of the nutrition businesses of Wockhardt Ltd. of India for $130 million cash in late July, and Evalve, a cardiovascular technology company, for up to $410 million, this month.

Twenty-one members of the AIDS Treatment Activists Coalition, a nonprofit group formed in 2001, researched the drug companies, interviewed executives and assigned grades assessing performance over the last quarter century, Mr. Huff said. The companies were scored on research and development, pricing, patient assistance programs, marketing, and community relations. More than one million people in the United States are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, though only about half of them have been discovered and treated, the government says. Untreated, H.I.V./AIDS leaves people vulnerable to infections and cancers. While treatment reduces symptoms and extends life, there is no cure. The report gave its highest grade, a B, to Merck, for producing Isentress, the first of a new class of AIDS drugs called integrase inhibitors. It also praised Merck for freezing prices for lower income users. Isentress, approved in 2007, is already used by 11 percent of the more than 550,000 people treated in the United States, Michael S. Seggev, a spokesman for Merck, said Wednesday. “We’re very pleased to have achieved the highest grade on the report card,” he said. “They’re the most respected and most representative coalition of H.I.V. community groups in the U.S., so their opinion is very meaningful.” The group gave an F to Abbott for raising the wholesale price of Norvir, the first drug proved to increase survival in AIDS patients, by 400 percent in 2003. Norvir is a key ingredient in most AIDS treatment cocktails. The price increaes provoked an outcry by many patients and others. An Abbott spokesman, Dirk van Eeden, responded Wednesday, “The H.I.V. community is an important stakeholder for us, so yes, we do take notice of the comments they make.” He added, “We really believe we’ve discovered important medicines and played our part in making sure the patients who need it can get it.” Other grades included a B for Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, owned by Johnson and Johnson as a separate company focusing on infectious diseases; C-plus for Pfizer, which announced in April a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to spin off a company focused on H.I.V.; C-plus for Gilead Sciences; C-minus grades for Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline, both criticized for high prices; a D-plus for Boehringer Ingelheim; and a D for Hoffman LaRoche, which the coalition said has the most expensive drug on the market. Representatives for Pfizer, Gilead and Boehringer responded Wednesday that they valued the group’s opinion and continued their work in AIDS. Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline officials each said they were “disappointed” and deserved better grades. Other companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The coalition was to some degree biting the hand that feeds it. It receives all of its financing from drug companies, mostly for activists to travel to meetings with them. The executive director, Edward T. Rewolinski, disclosed specific amounts to The New York Times for the last two years. “None of our members has the wherewithal to afford this activity,” he said. “People like that would never be influenced by the flow of money,” Jennifer Flynn, managing director of an unrelated AIDS group, Health GAP, in New York, said. The top fund provider was Gilead with $100,000, followed by Pfizer, $63,000; Bristol-Myers Squibb, $50,000; Tibotec, $45,000; Merck, $15,000; and Boehringer, $5,000. Abbott gave no money. Mr. Huff said the grading group was insulated from financing requests. “There’s no sugarcoating,” he said. “The membership feels that the pharmaceutical industry can be doing a much better job, whether it’s innovation or pricing.” The coalition was formed in 2001 partly to coordinate contacts with drug companies instead of letting the industry decide whom to invite to meetings.

Mr. Huff said the grading group was insulated from financing requests. “There’s no sugarcoating,” he said. “The membership feels that the pharmaceutical industry can be doing a much better job, whether it’s innovation or pricing.” The coalition was formed in 2001 partly to coordinate contacts with drug companies instead of letting the industry decide whom to invite to meetings.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/business/28stent.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Medtronic Settles Abbott’s Stent Suit<date>Published: July 27, 2009</date><text>Medtronic said Monday it had agreed to pay Abbott Laboratories $400 million to settle patent lawsuits related to the design of artery-opening stents.

The two lawmakers, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, sent a letter asking the nonprofit group that sponsors the conference, the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, for information about its financial relationships with device manufacturers and drug producers. The senators also sent a letter to Columbia University, which has an affiliation with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. Two well-known researchers at Columbia, Dr. Martin B. Leon and Dr. Gregg W. Stone, are involved with the foundation; Dr. Leon is its former chairman and Dr. Stone its current one. In a statement, the foundation said it would ''comply fully'' with the information request. ''C.R.F. is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all of its research and educational activities and ensuring independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in all of its programs,'' the statement said. According to the foundation's most recent tax filing on the Web site guidestar.org, it had revenue in 2005 of $47.2 million. Columbia University Medical Center issued a statement saying it would respond to the request for information. ''It is important to note that Columbia University and its Medical Center have conflict of interest policies and procedures in place, and we expect that they are followed by all members of the faculty,'' the statement said. The manufacturers cited in the senators' letters are Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Medinol. The annual conference here, known as Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, has attracted hundreds of doctors from around the world who specialize in using devices that are placed in the body through catheters, most notably heart stents, the tiny devices that are used to prop open clogged arteries. At the meeting, manufacturers of stents and related surgical products or drugs display their products in an exhibition hall. The letters sent Thursday are part of a recent wave of inquiries by Senators Grassley and Kohl into potential conflicts of interests between medical researchers and drug and device companies. The lawmakers are also among those sponsoring legislation that would require the industry to more fully disclose such financial ties. In their letter to the foundation, the lawmakers also took note of a comment in an article published last November in The New York Times. In the article, a researcher, Dr. Jeffrey W. Moses, who serves on the board of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said that the safety of heart stents ''is not the big issue any more.'' The senators wrote: ''As you are no doubt aware, there are divergent scientific opinions concerning such products, the safety and efficacy of which are a matter of dispute among cardiologists.'' The letter to the Cardiovascular Research Foundation asked the group to disclose all financing it had received since 2003 from the five device manufacturers named in the letter and also to provide documentation of any payments and benefits the foundation had provided to 22 researchers including Dr. Stone, Dr. Leon and Dr. Moses. The lawmakers asked Columbia to provide information about the disclosures those researchers had made to the institution about their income from industry sources. At the same conference on Thursday, researchers released results of a new study indicating that a drug-coated stent called Endeavor, made by Medtronic, was linked to more heart attacks and deadly blood clots than the Cypher stent made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFDC103EF935A25753C1A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott's Profit Surges<date>Published: October 16, 2008</date><text>Abbott Laboratories said on Wednesday that its third-quarter profit jumped 51 percent, led by sales of the arthritis medication Humira and a steep increase in sales of stents and other heart-related devices.

Reviews Arthritis Drugs for Links to Cancer<date>Published: June 5, 2008</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it was investigating whether four drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system diseases might increase the risk of cancer in children. The F.D.A. said that it had received reports of 30 cases of cancer over 10 years among children and young adults treated with those drugs, which are sold by Amgen, Abbott Laboratories and other companies. But the agency did not make clear how many children had taken the drugs or whether the cancer incidence among them was higher than would be expected. And it said that for now, it believed that the potential benefits of the medicines outweighed the potential risks ''in certain children and young adults.'' The drugs involved are Enbrel, sold by Amgen and Wyeth; Remicade, sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson and, in Europe, by Schering-Plough; Humira, sold by Abbott Laboratories; and Cimzia, which won approval in April and is sold by UBC, a Belgian company. All the drugs try to damp inflammation by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor, and they are used to treat various immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, which is an inflammation of the bowel. The TNF-blockers, as they are known, represent one of the most successful classes of drugs ever developed using biotechnology. Remicade, Humira and Enbrel had combined sales of more than $13 billion last year. But use in children constitutes a small part of the total. Dr. Michael Severino, an Amgen executive, said about a half-million patients had been treated with Enbrel since its approval about a decade ago, of which only 12,000 were children. Remicade is approved to treat Crohn's disease in children. Enbrel and Humira are approved to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis, once known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In fact the label on Enbrel was changed in March to allow use in children as young as 2, from a previous suggested lower age of 4. Amgen is now seeking approval of Enbrel to treat psoriasis in children, an issue that will be discussed by an advisory panel to the F.D.A. on June 18. Since the drugs block part of the immune system, it has always been known that they might contribute to higher risk of cancers and also infections. The labels for the drugs all contain warnings to that effect -- particularly about the risk of lymphomas, which are cancers of immune system cells. About half the cancers reported in the children getting the drugs were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the F.D.A. said. A study that pooled data from randomized clinical trials, found that adults given Humira or Remicade to treat rheumatoid arthritis had 2.4 times the cancer rate of those in the control groups. ''It's clearly something we have to be concerned about and discuss with our patients,'' said Dr. Eric L. Matteson, chairman of rheumatology at the Mayo Clinic and an author of the study, which was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Matteson has been a consultant to many of the companies developing such drugs. Dr. Edward H. Giannini, professor of pediatric rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said that 70,000 to 100,000 children in the United States had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and that the biotech drugs were ''unequaled'' in their ability to control the disease. ''This was a disease that put kids in wheelchairs,'' he said. Dr. Giannini, who received consulting fees from the companies for helping to devise their pediatric clinical trials, said that no cases of cancer were seen in the clinical trials that led to Enbrel's approval for pediatric use. And a subsequent registry that followed 600 children found no cases after more than 800 patient-years of exposure. Still, he said, ''We have to be careful with the safety aspects of giving immune response modifiers to very young children,'' whose immune systems might not be mature yet. Michael Parks, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company had already submitted data to the F.D.A. Most of the cancer cases associated with Remicade use were in children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. And all but one of those children also received other immune-suppressing drugs with a known cancer risk, he said. Laureen Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said there had been no instances of cancer in children given Humira in clinical trials or in postapproval safety studies. Humira was approved for pediatric use a few months ago. The F.D.A. announcement had little impact on the stocks of the companies involved.

Approves Drug for Intestinal Disease<date>Published: January 15, 2008</date><text>Tysabri, a treatment for multiple sclerosis made by Biogen Idec and Elan, received regulatory approval on Monday for use among patients with a severe intestinal disorder. The Food and Drug Administration approved Tysabri for use in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who do not respond to more conventional drugs, like Humira, which is made by Abbott Laboratories. The approval represents a comeback for Tysabri, which was temporarily pulled from the market in 2005 after three patients using the drug developed a rare nervous system disorder called multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The F.D.A. allowed the drug back on the market the following year, but only under a restricted distribution program. The drug is used by more than 12,000 multiple sclerosis patients in the United States, according to Biogen, with no new reports of the fatal disorder. Government officials said Tuesday that Crohn's disease patients would have to enroll in a similar distribution program for Tysabri. Patients must undergo an educational program on the drug's risks and can receive the injectable drug only from a select group of physicians. About 500,000 people in the United States have Crohn's, which usually causes diarrhea, fever and internal bleeding. There is no known cure. Biogen said distribution of Tysabri for Crohn's patients would begin by the end of next month. Biogen said it hoped to expand Tysabri's market to 100,000 patients by 2010, which would give the drug annual sales of $670 million. The drug is expected to compete with Remicade, the leading Crohn's treatment, made by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Shares of Biogen Idec rose 96 cents to $59.98. Shares of Elan fell 4 cents to $24.85 in after-hours trading, after rising 13 cents, to $24.89.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/business/06suits.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Vans and Skechers, Squaring Off in Court<date>Published: January 6, 2008</date><text>It is fairly common for apparel makers to “borrow” ideas from one another, but when it comes to those checkerboard slip-ons, Vans Inc. feels very protective.

The results were bolstered by strong demand for Humira, an arthritis drug, and overseas sales of the recently acquired Xience stent used to prop open coronary arteries. But net profit was little changed because of an array of charges that totaled more than $300 million. The company, based in suburban Chicago, said it earned $717 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $716 million, or 46 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding the special items, Abbott earned 67 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had expected 66 cents a share. Abbott's stock price has fallen more than 7 percent since Oct. 4, amid worries whether the Food and Drug Administration would speedily approve Xience, which is now wresting European market share from rival stents like Johnson &amp; Johnson's Cypher. Abbott's global revenue rose 14.4 percent in the period, to $6.38 billion, about $100 million higher than Wall Street forecasts.

The deal, announced in January, had been seen as part of G.E.’s strategy to increase its business in clinical diagnostics, which Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief, had identified as an area for growth. The companies offered no specific reasons except to say that they had failed to agree on final terms and conditions. A General Electric unit, GE Healthcare, has annual revenue around $16 billion and is a leader in expensive diagnostics machines like CAT scanners and M.R.I. equipment.

The acquisitions strategy is seen as an effort to expand in high-growth businesses  including oil and gas, aerospace control and bioengineering. A spokesman, Russell Wilkerson, said G.E.’s plan to invest in diagnostics had not changed. “About 70 percent of resources are applied to treating disease,” he said. “Our goal is to shift the focus on the front end, i.e., an ‘ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure’ approach. Diagnostics is a key part of that.” The two Abbott units, called core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics, generated more than $2 billion in sales last year.

What do you do when patients come who can’t pay? Some doctors decline to see them. I have expenses to pay and a family to feed, they’ll argue. But I grew up in a rural part of Ohio where an inordinate number of poor people live. My mother is a pediatrician there, and from the start, she could not imagine turning children away. Up to 20 percent of her patients have been without insurance, and more than half were on Medicaid, which paid terribly and was refused by other doctors. Some patients were not very grateful. Some were not as poor as they claimed. But we could count on my father’s better-paying urology practice to cross-subsidize. So that’s what she did. The message from my parents was straightforward: We are in medicine and that comes with certain moral obligations. So I’ve understood that part of my job is to see those who can’t pay — even if sometimes it hurts. I’ve been thinking about this as I’ve watched the arguments unfold about what pharmaceutical companies should charge in the developing world. The history of H.I.V. drugs has not been pretty. First, for almost a decade, we in the West ignored the possibility that antiretroviral drugs could be used in the developing world. (Remember the 2001 claim of U.S. government officials that Africans couldn’t learn to take the drugs on time because they didn’t have watches?) Then, under international pressure, drug companies made some discounts, but they were not deep enough. (A year’s supply was still more than $1,000 per patient.) Only when an Indian generic manufacturer provided a copycat three-drug regimen for $150 per year and major donors stepped forward did distribution effectively reach poor countries. We’re now in the throes of another round of H.I.V. drug battles, this time over advanced, but even more expensive drug regimens from Merck and Abbott Laboratories. Last week, the Clinton Foundation endorsed decisions by Thailand and Brazil to break the companies’ patents and purchase cheaper, copycat versions of the drugs. Abbott retaliated by withholding seven new drugs from Thailand, including an antibiotic, a painkiller, and a medication for high-blood pressure. The fight has become vicious. In a way, it’s hard to see how the confrontation could be avoided. The cost of developing a new drug now approaches $1 billion, and companies do need profit margins to recoup that cost and encourage new innovation. Yet, once a life-saving discovery is made, it is clearly grotesque to make millions suffer or die while waiting for a 20-year patent to expire. The experience with H.I.V. drugs is oddly heartening, though. There is, in fact, a spectrum of behavior among pharmaceutical companies — just like with doctors. Gilead Sciences has granted licenses to generic manufacturers to supply its blockbuster H.I.V. drug, Viread, to the world’s hundred poorest countries at the reasonable royalty rate of 5 percent of sales. Bristol-Meyers Squibb licensed its second-line drug, Reyataz, completely free of royalties to generic manufacturers for India and southern Africa. And through the World Health Organization’s bulk vaccine purchasing arrangements, manufacturers have been able to make significant profits selling vaccines at low cost but large volumes. This is the progress we want to build upon. Pressure to broaden these efforts will grow, and it should. Agreement on regional pricing tiers and distribution networks for H.I.V. drugs show likelihood of solidifying in ways that make drugs available and support innovation, but we have nothing like it for drugs for heart disease, lung disease, or cancer. Meanwhile, the world is changing. The No. 1 cause of death in India, China, and Vietnam is not H.I.V. It’s heart disease. Cancer is in the top 10. Their people need clot-busting drugs, chemotherapies, and EKG machines just like everyone else. Manufacturers need to show the same willingness to make these life-saving technologies available to the poor. Some will argue, hey, companies just invent this stuff; it isn’t their job to make sure every country gets some. But that’s not right. As Arthur Caplan, the bioethicist, points out, “You aren’t manufacturing pantyhose when you’re in health care. There are special moral duties attached.” And one of them is: If you’re building a lifeboat, you have to think about how many you can get inside.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DD113EF937A35756C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=abbottlaboratories">Epilepsy Drug Can Increase Risk for Newborns, Study Says<date>Published: May 4, 2007</date><text>Doctors reported yesterday that expectant mothers with epilepsy who took a commonly prescribed drug to control seizures were at increased risk of having a child with mental deficits. Toddlers who had been exposed in the womb to the drug Depakote, from Abbott Laboratories, scored seven to eight points lower on I.Q. tests at age 2 than those whose mothers had been taking other epilepsy drugs while pregnant, the study found. They were twice as likely to score in the range associated with mental retardation, according to the authors, who presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Boston. Other researchers said the findings should be considered preliminary because I.Q. measures were less reliable in 2-year-olds than in older children; the study will continue, tracking children through age 6. The report is consistent with several recent studies finding that Depakote is more likely than other so-called anticonvulsant drugs to increase the risk of mental deficits and other birth defects, like neural tube problems. An estimated 24 million American women have taken these drugs -- which include Tegretol from Novartis, Lamictal from GlaxoSmithKline and Dilantin from Parke Davis -- for an array of problems, including epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraine headaches, according to an analysis by the Epilepsy Foundation. ''Depakote looks worse than the other drugs in all of these recent studies,'' said Dr. Kimford J. Meador, a professor of neurology at the University of Florida and the lead author of the new study. ''In all, it is compelling evidence that this drug should not be used as a first-line choice for treatment in pregnant women.'' Laureen Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said that for many women, ''Depakote may be the only effective seizure control medication, and that decision should be made thoughtfully between physician and patient to fully evaluate the risk vs. benefit of treatment.'' The drug's label now states that Depakote ''has been associated with birth defects in children of women who have taken it while pregnant.'' Untreated seizures can endanger the life of a fetus and the expectant mother. And some 90 percent of women with epilepsy give birth to healthy, developmentally normal children even though many are taking medication, experts say. The researchers followed 185 children through age 2, using standard I.Q. measures. The mothers in the study, while pregnant, took either Depakote, Lamictal, Tegretol or Dilantin. After controlling for the mothers' I.Q. scores, the researchers found that 2-year-olds exposed to Depakote scored significantly lower on standard intelligence measures than the others. ''It's fair to say that there has been concern about these drugs, and particularly Depakote, for the past two or three years, but we'll know the complete story about its effect on cognitive development when we look at older children,'' said Dr. Lewis Holmes, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/25drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Charge at Abbott Results in Loss<date>Published: January 25, 2007</date><text>Abbott Laboratories posted a big fourth-quarter loss yesterday, as a charge related to its $3.7 billion purchase of Kos Pharmaceuticals offset higher sales of medical devices and drugs.

Congress acted to rein in oil drillers subsidies, and some of the countrys biggest companies joined traditional foes to address some of the countrys thorniest problems. Skip to next paragraph Douglas Healey/Bloomberg News Walter A. Forbes, formerly of Cendant, was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in prison for fraud and ordered to pay billions in restitution. The frothy mergers-and-acquisition market bubbled along, with bids, battles and, well, one bomb. TOUCH AND GO The American economy seems to have made a so-called soft landing after the housing market peaked last year, and appears to be taking off again, the latest economic data suggested. A tight labor market is pushing up many workers wages, consumers are spending more at shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country. A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month, and the Consumer Price Index, the nations best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months  on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. The numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when it meets at the end of this month, and may actually have to raise rates later in the year. ROLLING BACK BREAKS House Democrats passed legislation to rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for domestic oil producers and use the money for alternative energy and conservation technologies. The bill would rescind $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies that Congress passed in 2004 and 2005 and add $6.3 billion in royalties from companies that pump oil and gas in publicly owned waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska. It would also correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that will let oil companies avoid paying billions of dollars in royalties over the next decade. Senate leaders say they have the votes to send the bill to President Bush. The president opposes the measure, but is not expected to veto it. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa and seven other major companies joined with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. Members of the group  which also includes the utilities Duke Energy in North Carolina, PG&amp;E in California, the FPL Group in Florida and PNM Resources in New Mexico  have expressed concern that the absence of a national policy could lead to a scattershot system of state-by-state regulation or to even harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels. Earlier, a coalition of 16 business, medical and consumer groups  including AARP, the American Medical Association, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States  proposed to extend health coverage to people now uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. The environmental groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, a day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address. BURST OF BUYING General Electric announced a pair of big acquisitions, agreeing to pay $8.13 billion for two Abbott Laboratories diagnostics units and $4.8 billion for Smiths Aerospace, an aviation electronics maker in London. Including its offer earlier in the month to buy Vetco Gray, an oil and gas drilling services company in Houston, G.E. has committed itself to almost $15 billion worth of takeovers in January alone. The New York Times reported on Jan. 9 that G.E. was in talks to sell its plastics unit, a slow-growing business that could nonetheless sell for as much as $10 billion. Additional deals may have to wait for a decision on the plastics business because G.E.s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said last month that G.E. had $7 billion in cash on hand for industrial acquisitions this year. JUST SAY NO In a rare example of a board denying a request by a controlling shareholder, the directors of Cablevision Systems rejected an $8.9 billion buyout offer from its founding family, the Dolans. The board said in a letter to the family that the offer does not represent fair value for the companys public shareholders nor does it contemplate a transaction that is in their best interest. Cablevision remains publicly owned, but the Dolans, who own 20 percent of its equity but control 70 percent of its votes, have said they will not sell the company to anyone besides themselves. TRIBUNE BIDS Two firm bidders stepped up with offers to buy the Tribune Company, a media company with television stations and newspapers in the nations biggest media markets, but neither offered much of a premium over the companys flagging stock price. One bid came from Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, two billionaires in Los Angeles, where the Tribune Company owns The Los Angeles Times and KTTV. The other came from the Chandler family, which sold the Los Angeles paper and several others to Tribune in 2000. A private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, offered to buy only the TV stations. Tribune directors will review the situation this weekend and may ask for new bids. RAISING THE STAKES Express Scripts began a $24.8 billion hostile takeover attempt for a rival pharmacy benefits manager, Caremark Rx, prompting a competing bidder, the CVS Corporation, to raise its offer. Caremark rebuffed Express Scripts in favor of CVSs lower offer. Some shareholders sued Caremarks board, saying the directors put their financial interests ahead of shareholder interests. CVS, the drugstore chain, said it intended to conclude the takeover by April. STIFF SENTENCE A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., sentenced Walter A. Forbes, the former chairman of the Cendant Corporation, to 12 years and 7 months in prison and ordered him to pay $3.275 billion in restitution for leading the largest accounting fraud of the 1990s. A jury convicted Mr. Forbes in October of conspiracy and making false statements in a fraud that cost Cendant and its investors $3 billion.

More Articles in Business »BUOYED by encouraging economic news, the stock market bobbed near a record high this week. Congress acted to rein in oil drillers subsidies, and some of the countrys biggest companies joined traditional foes to address some of the countrys thorniest problems. Skip to next paragraph Douglas Healey/Bloomberg News Walter A. Forbes, formerly of Cendant, was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in prison for fraud and ordered to pay billions in restitution. The frothy mergers-and-acquisition market bubbled along, with bids, battles and, well, one bomb. TOUCH AND GO The American economy seems to have made a so-called soft landing after the housing market peaked last year, and appears to be taking off again, the latest economic data suggested. A tight labor market is pushing up many workers wages, consumers are spending more at shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country. A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month, and the Consumer Price Index, the nations best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months  on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. The numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when it meets at the end of this month, and may actually have to raise rates later in the year. ROLLING BACK BREAKS House Democrats passed legislation to rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for domestic oil producers and use the money for alternative energy and conservation technologies. The bill would rescind $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies that Congress passed in 2004 and 2005 and add $6.3 billion in royalties from companies that pump oil and gas in publicly owned waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska. It would also correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that will let oil companies avoid paying billions of dollars in royalties over the next decade. Senate leaders say they have the votes to send the bill to President Bush. The president opposes the measure, but is not expected to veto it. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa and seven other major companies joined with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. Members of the group  which also includes the utilities Duke Energy in North Carolina, PG&amp;E in California, the FPL Group in Florida and PNM Resources in New Mexico  have expressed concern that the absence of a national policy could lead to a scattershot system of state-by-state regulation or to even harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels. Earlier, a coalition of 16 business, medical and consumer groups  including AARP, the American Medical Association, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States  proposed to extend health coverage to people now uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. The environmental groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, a day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address.

May Buy Abbott’s Diagnostic Unit<date>Published: January 18, 2007</date><text>General Electric is near a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories’ medical diagnostics unit for as much as $5 billion, according to people involved in the negotiations. Acquiring the Abbott business, which makes and sells glucose monitoring systems, blood test kits and other chemically based diagnostic tools, would enable G.E.’s health care unit to expand its growing stable of diagnostic products and services. The G.E. unit, GE Healthcare, has annual revenue of about $16 billion and has long been a leader in expensive diagnostic machines like CAT scanners and MRI equipment. The Abbott product line would help G.E. add nursing homes and other nonhospital medical settings to its base, analysts said. They predicted that G.E. would quickly wring efficiencies from the Abbott Diagnostics unit. GE Healthcare’s margins generally top 16 percent, they said, while Abbott Diagnostics’ margins are about 7 percent. The diagnostics business, while profitable for Abbott Laboratories, is far smaller than the company’s drug business, which had profits of $3.1 billion on sales of $9.84 billion in the first nine months of 2006. Abbott Diagnostics, by contrast, had profits of only $306 million during that period, on sales of $2.98 billion. In November, Abbott Laboratories expanded its drug business by agreeing to buy Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion. Abbott is also betting on growth in its cardiovascular stent business. Early last year the company paid $4.1 billion to acquire Guidant’s stent and other vascular business as part of the deal that enabled Boston Scientific to acquire Guidant. Abbott is now hoping to win federal approval to enter the lucrative market of selling drug-coated stents  tiny metal devices that are designed to prop open coronary arteries after blockages have been cleared. Abbott’s diagnostics business, though, has been under something of a cloud since the company agreed in 1999 to pay $100 million to settle accusations that it had failed to meet federal quality standards in producing its test kits. “They lost a lot of ground to competitors,” said one analyst, who said that he could not be identified until the deal was formally announced. “Shedding it to streamline management makes some sense,” the analyst said. “It’s a natural progression of their morphing away from the hospital supply business.” He noted that Abbott in 2004 had sold off its hospital products business into an entity called Hospira. For G.E.’s part, the acquisition continues an acquisition strategy that has included buying Amersham, a British diagnostic pharmaceuticals and biosciences company, for more than $9 billion in 2004. But some analysts wondered whether G.E. was overpaying. “G.E. is getting a reputation as a place that will pay top dollar for a fixer-upper,” said another analyst, who declined to be identified because he had not yet written to his clients about the deal. The deal would comes just after G.E. announced on Monday that it was buying Smiths Aerospace for $4.8 billion. That announcement came less than a week after word emerged that G.E. had put its lackluster plastics business on the auction block, in the hope of getting $8 billion to $10 billion for it. Barnaby J.

Abbott plans to buy Kos, based in Cranbury, N.J., for $78 a share in cash, a 56 percent premium over its closing price Friday. The main product of Kos is Niaspan, which raises levels of ''good,'' or HDL, cholesterol. The company also makes Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug that treats patients with multiple lipid disorders. Kos also has several late-stage drugs in development, including treatments for asthma and diabetes. It had revenue of $751.7 million in 2005. ''This was a company that was primed to be taken out,'' said Mark Taylor, a senior pharmaceutical analyst at Roth Capital Partners. ''Sooner or later the world needed to realize how undervalued Kos is, and there's no better way than having a major player like Abbott buy the company for this kind of premium.'' Abbott's own cholesterol products include TriCor, which it markets in the United States through an agreement with Solvay Pharmaceuticals. Abbott, which is based in suburban Chicago, expects the transaction to depress earnings by 2 cents to 3 cents a share in 2007, not affect profit in 2008, and add to earnings thereafter. The deal is subject to approval by Kos shareholders and federal regulators. Company officials said Monday that they hoped it would be completed in several months. Shares of Kos rose $26.97, or nearly 54 percent, to close at $77.06. Shares of Abbott fell 17 cents, to $47.47.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/business/19drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Earnings Climb 5% at Abbott Laboratories<date>Published: October 19, 2006</date><text>Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that its third-quarter profit increased 5 percent, helped by tax-related items. Net income rose to $715.8 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $680.7 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. This years results include costs related to its acquisition of Guidants vascular stent business. Excluding certain items, earnings were $898.8 million, or 58 cents a share, the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial. Revenue rose to $5.57 billion from $5.38 billion, compared with Wall Streets estimate of $5.48 billion. Abbott said the sales increase was 14.9 percent after excluding the 2005 sales of three drugs, Mobic, Flomax and Micardis, which it stopped selling Jan. 1 under a co-promotion and distribution agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim. Drug sales in the United States grew nearly 17 percent, adjusting for that agreement, helped by the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. The chairman and chief executive, Miles D. White, said the sales gain was highlighted by 20 percent growth in medical products, including vascular devices. Another drug maker, Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands, said it might have to delay the release of a new drug to treat schizophrenia after obtaining mixed results in a trial. The chief executive, Hans Wijers, said in a conference call that results from a late-stage trial of the drug, Asenapine, in the United States were expected within several weeks. He said the drug, being developed with Pfizer, had been successful in treating mania and bipolar disorder, but for the schizophrenia study, we have achieved mixed results. Akzo also said profit rose to 313 million euros ($392.5 million), from 175 million euros.

Johnson &amp; Johnson filed suit against Boston Scientific, Guidant and Abbott Laboratories for $5.5 billion in damages. The suit claims that the three companies illegally shared information on their way to scuttling Guidants agreement to sell itself to Johnson &amp; Johnson for about $21.5 billion. Boston Scientific ended up winning Guidant with a cash and stock offer of about $27 billion, or $78.88 a share, which it partly offset with about $6.3 billion in side deals with Abbott. The most important of those deals was the sale to Abbott of Guidants stent and other vascular product operations for $4.1 billion, with another $500 million in potential future payments. That deal provided much-needed cash and eliminated potential antitrust problems that Boston Scientific would have faced if it had acquired all of Guidant. Johnson &amp; Johnsons lawsuit says that the winning bid and side deals would never have been struck if Guidant had not allowed Abbott to review proprietary information about the units that it later bought. Guidant had no right to allow Abbott such a review, the lawsuit contends. Boston Scientific said yesterday that it did not understand why Johnson &amp; Johnson had waited five months after the deal closed to pursue its objections. In a statement the company said: We believe the suit is meritless, and we expect to demonstrate that in court. Abbott said in a statement: The suit is without merit. Johnson &amp; Johnson said in its complaint that it notified Guidant in early January that it believed Guidant had violated the no solicitation clause in their agreement and had followed up with a written warning in a letter Jan. 23. Guidant responded that it considered Abbott a joint bidder entitled to the information disclosed. The deal, which closed April 21, has not gone as smoothly as Boston Scientific expected. The company has experienced unexpectedly weak growth in the heart implant business, which was its main reason for acquiring Guidant. Its strange on the surface, because Johnson &amp; Johnson probably benefited by not getting Guidant, Robert M. Goldman, who follows the medical device industry for KeyBanc Capital Markets, said of the lawsuit. Johnson &amp; Johnson also received $705 million from Guidant as a breakup fee. Johnson &amp; Johnson raised its bid twice before refusing to compete with Boston Scientifics last offer. Johnson &amp; Johnson had originally agreed to buy Guidant for $76 a share late in 2004. But reports of deadly defects in some of Guidants defibrillators and criticism of delays in disclosing that information to doctors hurt Guidants prospects so much that Johnson &amp; Johnson insisted on paying a lower price. That led to a $63.08-a-share deal that was nearing completion when Boston Scientific ignited a bidding war last December. Boston Scientifics shares, which closed trading yesterday down 15 cents at $14.80, have fallen nearly 40 percent this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is far larger and more diversified, rose 48 cents, to $64.67 yesterday. They have risen 6.3 percent this year. Abbott, which remains primarily a drug company but is expanding in devices, rose 12 cents, to $48.07. Its shares have climbed 19 percent this year. In an unrelated development yesterday, Johnson &amp; Johnson said federal regulators had cleared its Cordis subsidiary to market a stent to prop open neck arteries. Cordis was the first to complete clinical trials for the device, known as a carotid stent, but both Guidant and Abbott beat it to market because Cordis was hit more than two years ago with a warning letter citing numerous manufacturing and quality control violations at its factories. The Food and Drug Administration put all major marketing approvals for Cordis on hold while it dealt with those problems. That warning letter has not yet been lifted, but Cordis announced last month that all that remains is a reinspection by the Food and Drug Administration of its factory in San German, Puerto Rico. The carotid stent and a related filter are not made at that plant, according to Carol Goodrich, a Cordis spokeswoman.

Skip to next paragraph Pfizer said profit rose because a $4 billion cost-cutting program and sales of more profitable drugs for arthritis and pain offset a third consecutive quarterly revenue decline. Net income for Abbott climbed 3.2 percent as sales of its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis gained 39 percent. Schering, which agreed last month to be bought by a rival German drug maker Bayer, said earnings rose 21 percent, helped by sales of the Yasmin birth control pill. Pfizer, Abbott and Schering are the first of the big drug makers to report first-quarter results. Pfizer said net income increased to $4.1 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $301 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company paid a tax bill associated with the transfer of profit to the United States from abroad. Revenue fell 3 percent, to $12.7 billion, as some drugs lost patent protection. The chief executive, Hank McKinnell, said Pfizer would buy back $1 billion of its shares in the second quarter after buying $1 billion in the first. Pfizer, which is based in New York, raised its 2006 earnings forecast, citing lower expenses because of its plan to cut $4 billion from annual costs by 2008. Sales of Pfizer's year-old medication Lyrica increased to $192 million in the first quarter from $20 million a year earlier. Lyrica, a treatment for pain associated with diabetes and shingles, may generate revenue this year of $900 million, Pfizer said. Sales of the arthritis drug Celebrex rose 19 percent, to $592 million. Sales of the cholesterol drug Lipitor rose 1 percent, to $3.1 billion. Abbott's net income rose to $864.9 million, or 56 cents a share, from $837.9 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.7 percent, to $5.18 billion, because of a change in a drug marketing agreement. The company, which is based in Abbott Park, Ill., said sales of Humira rose to $392 million in the first quarter. Sales of all pharmaceutical products declined because of the end of a co-promotion agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany. Sales of Abbott's Depakote, for epilepsy, rose 14 percent, to $246 million, and the H.I.V. treatment Kaletra had an 18 percent gain, to $280 million. Abbott said revenue from diagnostics rose 3.5 percent, to $918 million. Sales of nutritional supplies rose 13 percent in the United States, to $766 million, and 18.2 percent in the rest of the world, to $376 million. Schering said first-quarter profit rose to 174 million euros ($213 million), helped by Yasmin, which has been on the market for five years, and the multiple sclerosis drug Betaseron, available for 13 years. First-quarter sales rose 12 percent, to 1.41 billion euros ($1.73 billion). Yasmin sales grew 34 percent and Betaseron rose 23 percent.

Skip to next paragraph Pfizer said profit rose because a $4 billion cost-cutting program and sales of more profitable drugs for arthritis and pain offset a third consecutive quarterly revenue decline. Net income for Abbott climbed 3.2 percent as sales of its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis gained 39 percent. Schering, which agreed last month to be bought by a rival German drug maker Bayer, said earnings rose 21 percent, helped by sales of the Yasmin birth control pill. Pfizer, Abbott and Schering are the first of the big drug makers to report first-quarter results. Pfizer said net income increased to $4.1 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $301 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company paid a tax bill associated with the transfer of profit to the United States from abroad.

It must still receive approval from the United States Federal Trade Commission for the deal. Boston Scientific said it still expected the acquisition to close around the middle of this month. To satisfy concerns that the combined company could command too great a share of the market for heart stents, Boston Scientific agreed before the regulatory reviews to sell a piece of Guidant's business, including its drug-coated stents, which keep blood vessels open. Abbott Laboratories, based near Chicago, will pay $4.1 billion in cash, provide a $900 million loan to Boston Scientific and acquire $1.4 billion in Boston Scientific stock. In addition to approving the Boston Scientific-Guidant deal, European regulators cleared the transaction involving Abbott. The companies need European regulatory approval because their products are sold overseas. Shareholders of Boston Scientific, based in Natick, and Guidant, based in Indianapolis, approved the transaction on March 31. Boston Scientific outbid Johnson &amp; Johnson in a battle to buy Guidant and its portfolio of stents, defibrillators, pacemakers and other medical devices. Boston Scientific agreed to pay Guidant shareholders nearly $4.5 million a day in interest for each day after March 31 that the acquisition failed to close.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/business/22abbott.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott President to Leave<date>Published: March 22, 2006</date><text>The president and chief operating officer for pharmaceuticals at Abbott Laboratories, Jeffrey M.

The offer, at $80 a share, proved irresistible: within hours, Guidant said it would switch its support from Johnson &amp; Johnson's merger proposal in favor of Boston Scientific's, which was valued more than $2 billion higher. Still, it was not certain that Boston Scientific had delivered a decisive blow in its battle to woo Guidant away from Johnson &amp; Johnson, the diversified drug and health care products company. Under the terms of its agreement with Guidant, Johnson &amp; Johnson has five business days to respond with a new offer. That seemed less likely yesterday after Johnson &amp; Johnson issued a press release suggesting that the deal between Guidant and Boston Scientific would greatly reduce the earnings of the merged company. Executives involved in the negotiations said that Guidant had signaled to Johnson &amp; Johnson that it would need to offer at least $77 a share to be considered by its board. While that would still be $3 a share below Boston Scientific's bid, Johnson &amp; Johnson's proposal has already undergone regulatory review and such a deal could be closed more quickly. Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would consider its options under its agreement with Guidant, which include the right to receive a $675 million breakup fee if Guidant abandoned their merger agreement. Analysts, who have been repeatedly surprised by developments in the competition, were careful yesterday not to rule out possibilities. At stake are Guidant's strong position in the fast-growing $10 billion market for heart devices and control of technology and market share in vascular devices, those used to treat damaged or blocked arteries. Abbott is injecting up to $6.2 billion into Boston Scientific's offer through a variety of side deals, stock sales and below-market-rate loans to that company. If Boston Scientific prevails, it has agreed to sell Guidant's vascular-device business to Abbott - a move that would give Abbott a big foothold in the medical device industry. Some analysts have speculated that competitive pride played a role in driving the bidding for Guidant higher. Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass., and the far larger Johnson &amp; Johnson, which at one time tried to buy it, are known for the intensity of their rivalry. While playing a strong offensive game, both companies seem equally intent on defense. "Not only do they both want Guidant, they both want the other guy not to get it," said Thomas J. Gunderson, who follows the device industry for Piper Jaffray from Minneapolis. "There's going to be lawsuits across the boards, no matter who gets what." The reaction of investors to yesterday's developments suggested that many were not convinced that Guidant was a worthwhile prize at such a high price. Guidant shares rose $5.38, or 7.6 percent, to $76.22. But Boston Scientific's shares fell more than 5 percent, to $23.90. Abbott dropped 12 cents, to $41.07, after agreeing to help Boston Scientific by buying $1.4 billion of Boston Scientific shares; increasing the price it will pay for two of Guidant's divisions by $300 million, to $4.1 billion; and raising the amount it will lend to Boston Scientific $200 million, to $900 million. Johnson &amp; Johnson's shares rose 54 cents in late-session trading after Guidant endorsed Boston Scientific. That wiped out an identical decline during regular trading; the shares settled last evening at $61.82. The heated rivalry between Johnson &amp; Johnson and Boston Scientific has been most evident in the $5 billion market for drug-coated coronary stents, tiny cylinders that prop open arteries. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been slowly chipping away at Boston Scientific's lead, but most analysts say that Boston Scientific is ahead in developing next-generation designs. In the meantime, the two companies are locked in patent battles seeking to block each other's products. Guidant's efforts to find a merger partner began when the company, based in Indianapolis, reached an agreement in December 2004 with Johnson &amp; Johnson.

The pending agreement, which would lower the drug's price to 63 cents a pill from $1.17, comes after months of negotiations and stern warnings from Brazil that it would disregard Abbott's patent and make a generic version of Kaletra domestically if the company did not lower the price to a level it deemed affordable. A drop in the price of Kaletra, Brazilian officials argued, was essential for the government to sustain and expand the scale of its AIDS program, which provides free medicine and treatment to H.I.V.-positive patients. Coupled with $3 million worth of other pharmaceuticals that Abbott has offered to donate as part of the agreement, the prospective savings would be $339.5 million from 2006 to 2011, the government said. Karla Mendes, a spokeswoman for Health Minister José Saraiva Felipe, said, "The new price meets Brazil's demands and will enable the government to apply the savings to other areas of treatment." The minister, who announced the pending contract at an AIDS conference in São Paulo late Monday, said officials were assessing the final terms but expected to complete it by Thursday. The agreement would take effect in March. Abbott said it was prepared to close the deal and was waiting to receive a signed copy of it from the Brazilians. An accord would end a standoff that began in July, when the departing health minister, Humberto Costa, announced an agreement with Abbott at an undisclosed price. But when Mr. Felipe took office, he dismissed the agreement and said he would seek further price reductions.

Approval for Neck Stent With a Filter<date>Published: September 16, 2005</date><text>Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that it had received regulatory approval to sell a combination of implanted devices that reduce stroke risk in patients whose neck arteries have been narrowed by a buildup of fatty tissue. Skip to next paragraph Animation: Inserting a Carotid Stent (abbottvascular.com) The system pairs a metal mesh stent for propping open a neck artery with a filter that can trap loose bits of fat or blood clots before they reach the small blood vessels in the brain and form blockages that cut off circulation. Once the stent is in place, the filter is removed. The approval by the Food and Drug Administration makes Abbott the first domestic competitor for Guidant, which was cleared to market its neck stent and filter system just over a year ago. The devices, known as carotid stents and embolic filters, sell for more than $3,000 a kit. While the worldwide market is estimated at only $130 million this year, analysts forecast that such devices will grow into a $500 million to $1 billion segment of the stent market. The approval is good news for Abbott, which has had disappointments in its drug business, the company's biggest operating unit. On Tuesday, a federal advisory panel unanimously recommended that regulators deny Abbott permission to market Xinlay, a prostate cancer drug. And some analysts predict the company will have trouble gaining approval for the next big drug in its pipeline, a heart-failure medication called Simdax. Abbott and Guidant, which is being acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson, may not have the carotid device business to themselves for long. Boston Scientific has said it hopes to be cleared to enter the domestic market by the end of the year with stent and filter devices it has been selling in Europe since 1999, and then to begin selling newer technology early next year. Also, the F.D.A. has told Johnson &amp; Johnson that the stent and filter system it began developing before the Guidant deal is "approvable." Final clearance to enter the market is being withheld until the F.D.A. is satisfied that Johnson has dealt with manufacturing and record-keeping issues raised in two warning letters the agency sent last year. Johnson believes it has responded to the complaints and approval could come soon, according to Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for the unit that makes carotid devices. The company has not said whether it wants to market both systems after the Guidant takeover is completed. Medtronic, the largest independent device company, and several smaller device makers are also developing competing designs for carotid systems. Stents are tiny metal mesh scaffolds that prop open blood vessels after doctors clear away blockages. They are currently used primarily to treat heart and cardiovascular disease, with a worldwide market projected to top $5 billion this year. Researchers have worked for nearly two decades to adapt the technology to treat blockages in the two carotid arteries, the main highways for blood flow from the heart to the brain. Carotid disease - in which fatty plaque deposits build up in the artery and inhibit blood flow to the brain - is estimated to cause about 25 percent of the 700,000 strokes in the United States each year. Strokes trail only heart disease and cancer as a cause of death in this country and cost more than $50 billion annually, according to federal statistics. Before neck stents, the only way to remove carotid blockages was to cut open the artery. Research suggests carotid stenting produces similar stroke reduction rates as neck surgery, with fewer side effects and shorter recovery time. Medicare pays roughly $8,000 for the stenting procedure, comparable to the cost of basic neck surgery. "In the long run, the costs for stenting are going to be lower," said Dr. Gary S. Roubin, chairman of the interventional cardiology department at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, a leading center for carotid stenting research. Dr. Roubin owns carotid stent patents that have been licensed to Abbott and is a member of its scientific advisory board. The F.D.A. said last year that about 200,000 carotid operations are performed annually in the United States. The current market for the carotid stents and filters has been limited because the federal government has generally restricted stenting reimbursement to patients with severe carotid blockages and symptoms of stroke and those at high risk of stroke for whom the surgery would be too risky. A number of major clinical studies are under way that doctors believe will persuade insurers to expand coverage for the procedure.

But the panel voted 10 to 3 that Tarceva from OSI, which it markets with Genentech, was worthy of approval because it extended median survival compared to a placebo, even if only by 12 days. The F.D.A. itself will make the final decision on the two drugs, but it normally follows the advice of its advisory committees, which are made up of outside experts. Some patient advocates have criticized the F.D.A. for being too strict in considering cancer drugs, thereby depriving dying patients of chances, however slim, of extending their lives. But others have criticized the F.D.A. for being too lax in drug approvals and safety in general. Both cases at Tuesday's meeting in Bethesda, Md., tested the boundary of how little evidence the F.D.A. was willing to accept. Xinlay, a once-a-day pill that could achieve annual sales of at least several hundred million dollars, was studied as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer not kept in control by hormone therapies. But in two trials the drug failed to delay the progression of the disease by a statistically significant amount compared with a placebo. Abbott executives argued that in the 85 percent of patients whose cancer had already spread to bone, Xinlay did show a statistically meaningful benefit in delaying disease progression and staving off debilitating pain. But the F.D.A. staff sharply criticized the quality of the evidence and the panel voted that data from a subset of patients chosen after the trial was over was not "statistically persuasive." Several men with prostate cancer implored the committee to recommend approval because men with advanced disease have virtually no options other than a chemotherapy drug with severe side effects. More than 30,000 men in the United States die from prostate cancer each year. But some of the panel members said that more study was needed. "I don't think we ought to be swayed by an emotional appeal that there are thousands of people dying in pain and this drug will solve that problem or that it will cure them," said Dr. Michael C. Perry of the University of Missouri. "It will do neither," he said, adding that approving the drug now would be an "absolute disservice" to patients by making it harder to conduct new clinical trials. Abbott said in a statement that it would continue to study Xinlay, known generically as atrasentan, and that it believed it was effective. Tarceva, the OSI drug known generically as erlotinib, did show a statistically significant benefit in its clinical trial. So the question for the committee was more a judgment as to whether that benefit was meaningful to doctors and patients, especially given that Tarceva did not appear to improve the quality of patients' lives and had side effects including diarrhea and an increased risk of stroke. In a clinical trial, patients who received Tarceva along with Gemzar, from Eli Lilly, the main treatment for pancreatic cancer, lived a median of about 6.4 months, about 12 days longer than those who got Gemzar and a placebo. OSI executives argued that median survival - the time by which half the patients had died - understated the benefit of the drug. The difference in average length of life was five weeks. Dr. Silvana Martino, an oncologist from Santa Monica who is chairwoman of the panel, voted against approval. "I'm still sitting here scratching my head as to whether it's really valuable," she said. "We are going to be selling the drug and not really explaining to people what they are buying out of this." Some panel members said that patients should be allowed to judge what is meaningful and that as long as the trial result was statistically significant the drug should be approved. "None of us can put a statement on a week or a month," said Dr. Alexandra M. Levine of the University of Southern California. "It's a small piece of time, quote unquote. But given the normal median survival in this disease, it's not negligible." About 30,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year. Many people die within a few months of diagnosis and fewer than 4 percent live five years, the lowest survival rate among solid tumors.

A ministry spokesman, Esténio Brasileino, said Thursday that the government sent a letter to Abbott last week after several Brazilian laboratories notified the ministry that they could manufacture and sell a generic version of the drug, now purchased from Abbott at $1.17 a pill, for 41 cents a pill. After negotiations with Abbott in July, Brazil's departing health minister, Humberto Costa, said the government had reached an agreement with Abbott under which the drug maker would lower the price of Kaletra by an undisclosed amount. Without discussing terms, the government said the lower price would save it $259 million over six years. Kaletra, a widely used antiretroviral, is one of several medicines that make up the so-called cocktail used to treat patients with H.I.V. Less than a week later, however, José Saraiva Felipe, Mr. Costa's successor, dismissed the agreement and said Brazil would press for further reductions. Abbott, which is based in Abbott Park, Ill., said it last met with the Brazilian government about a week ago and was continuing to negotiate a possible price change. "We had what we thought was a very good agreement," said Brian Kyhos, a spokesman at Abbott headquarters. In light of the new demands, he added, "We will continue to seek a price level that Brazil can agree to and honor." The Brazilian demands reflect efforts by the government to reduce the ballooning costs of the country's ambitious AIDS program, which provides free medicines and treatment to those infected. The cost of Kaletra makes up nearly a third of the more than $300 million the country spends a year on medicines for the program. At present, some 170,000 people in Brazil, Latin America's most populous country, are believed to be infected with H.I.V., according to government figures. The growing numbers, the government argues, would allow it to declare a national health emergency - a move that under World Trade Organization rules would allow Brazil to break the patents on medicines and pay a 3 percent royalty to manufacturers for the rights to produce copycat versions. The standoff with Abbott is the latest of several battles waged by the Brazilian government to reduce the cost of medicines in developing countries.

But the F.D.A. did ask the company to remind doctors that people with known cardiovascular problems should not take the drug. Skip to next paragraph Tannen Maury/Bloomberg News A consumer group has called for a ban on sales of Meridia. The F.D.A. ruling, which Abbott announced yesterday, was in response to a petition filed in 2002 by the Health Research Group of the consumer advocate organization Public Citizen. The group asserted that Meridia was related to stroke and heart attacks. The petition cited records at the F.D.A, which had received reports of 30 deaths and 224 cases of serious but not fatal cardiovascular problems in Meridia patients from 1997 through late summer 2003. In an Aug. 9 letter denying the group's petition, the F.D.A. noted that heart attacks and strokes were frequently linked to obesity. While it was plausible that Meridia could be causing the problems, the letter said, the existing data made it impossible to conclude that patients taking Meridia suffered them at a rate higher than overweight people generally. The letter, signed by Dr. Steven K. Galson, the agency's acting director for drug research and evaluation, said the agency was monitoring a Meridia clinical trial in Europe. That study, involving 9,000 overweight patients, will compare the rate of heart attacks and strokes in Meridia patients with those taking a placebo. In Senate testimony last year, an F.D.A. safety officer, Dr. David Graham, listed Meridia as one of five potentially dangerous drugs the agency should review. Since then, the agency has taken some type of action or rendered findings on all five of the drugs. Bextra, the Pfizer painkiller, was ordered withdrawn from the market in April. Crestor, the anti-cholesterol drug manufactured by AstraZeneca, was allowed to remain on the market. The F.D.A. required new restrictions on the use of Accutane, an acne medication by Roche Holding known to cause birth defects. And an F.D.A. advisory panel ruled that the asthma drug Serevent, by GlaxoSmithKline, should remain on the market. Dr. Galson also said that the use of Meridia by obese patients carried a number of benefits besides weight loss. He cited one clinical trial that found Meridia helped patients lose weight - with 70 percent losing 5 percent or more of their weight and 46 percent losing 10 percent or more - and also lowered cholesterol and reduced the need for diabetes medications in many patients. Responding to the F.D.A. ruling, Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Health Research Group said his organization would continue to sound the alarm, even though Meridia had sales of only $60 million last year in the United States, which, he said, is evidence of a 60 percent decline in prescriptions since 2001. "The public is sort of running away from the drug," Dr. Wolfe said yesterday. "But still, a lot of people are getting it. Deaths are continuing to occur. There's no evidence in the long run that it works. When people stop using it, their weight goes back up." In a statement yesterday, Abbott Laboratories said Public Citizen's petition had "unnecessarily alarmed and misled patients." The company said it had already sent out a letter to doctors early this year and changed the drug's label to emphasize that Meridia should not be used in patients with cardiovascular problems. Some doctors have said that for many patients the weight loss from taking Meridia is not substantial enough to justify its cost, which is about $90 a month and is often not paid by prescription drug plans. Meridia is more widely used abroad, where it is sold under the name Reductil. Foreign sales of the product reached $240 million last year. That is a small fraction of Abbott's net sales of $19.6 billion last year.

In an interview with the Brazilian daily Correio Braziliense, José Saraiva Felipe, who was sworn in as health minister on July 8, the day the deal was made public, said that the agreement had not been signed and that the government was still negotiating with Abbott to get further reductions in the price of the drug, a widely used antiretroviral called Kaletra.

Michelle Johnson, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said, "We are continuing to meet with the Brazilian government to finalize the agreement." Ms. Johnson would not say if the terms of the deal would be modified. Last Friday, the government and Abbott announced an agreement that would freeze the annual amount Brazil pays for Kaletra over the next six years, even though the number of patients taking the drug is expected to jump to 60,000 from 23,400 in that period. Though financial terms were not disclosed, the government said the accord would allow it to save $259 million over six years. Brazil, which provides free AIDS treatment to all who need it, currently spends about $107 million a year on Kaletra, nearly a third of its budget for antiretroviral medicines. Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., also agreed to transfer its technology to Brazil eventually so that a state-run laboratory could begin producing a generic version of the drug when the company's patent expires in 2015.

Though financial terms were not disclosed, the government said the agreement would save it at least $18 million next year and a total of $259 million over the next six years. Brazil, which provides free AIDS treatment to all who need it, currently spends about $107 million a year on the drug, nearly a third of its annual budget for antiretroviral medicines. Humberto Costa, Brazil's former health minister, said the agreement would ensure the sustainability of the government's AIDS treatment program, which has been praised by AIDS activists as a model for other developing nations. "The 170,000 patients that use antiretroviral drugs can rest at ease," said Mr. Costa, who resigned his post late Friday as part of a broader cabinet shuffle. Under the agreement, Brazil's annual expenses for Kaletra will remain unchanged for the next six years, even though the number of patients that require the drug is expected to jump to 60,000 from 23,400 in the period. It also guarantees that Brazilian AIDS patients will have access to a new version of Kaletra, a drug called Meltrex, once it gains approval in the United States. Abbott, which is based in Abbott Park, Ill., also agreed to transfer its technology to the Brazilian government so that a state-run laboratory in Rio de Janeiro can begin producing a generic version of Kaletra when the company's patent expires in 2015. Abbott praised the agreement, saying it will help "Brazil expand patient access to Kaletra while preserving the company's intellectual property rights, which Abbott was not willing to negotiate." The standoff with Abbott was not the first time Brazil has clashed with large pharmaceutical companies. The country has successfully forced drug companies to lower prices on AIDS medicines several times in recent years by threatening to break their patents and produce copycat versions locally. This agreement could also ease tensions between the left-leaning government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the Bush administration, which has been pressing Brazil to step up its protection of intellectual property rights. Several members of Congress had urged the United States trade representative, Rob Portman, to retaliate by applying trade sanctions if Brazil followed through on its threat to break Abbott's patent.

This agreement could also ease tensions between the left-leaning government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the Bush administration, which has been pressing Brazil to step up its protection of intellectual property rights. Several members of Congress had urged the United States trade representative, Rob Portman, to retaliate by applying trade sanctions if Brazil followed through on its threat to break Abbott's patent. Brazil is also in negotiations with Gilead Sciences and Merck that are aimed at reducing prices on two other widely used AIDS drugs that they produce, Tenofovir and Efavirenz, respectively.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/25/health/25drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Brazil to Copy AIDS Drug Made by Abbott<date>Published: June 25, 2005</date><text>SÃO PAULO, Brazil, June 24 - Brazil announced late Friday that it would start copying an AIDS drug made by the American pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories to provide a cheaper version for its AIDS treatment program, becoming the first country to break the patent of an antiretroviral medicine. The Brazilian government, which provides free AIDS treatment to all who need it, estimates that it will save about 130 million reais a year, or about $55 million, by making a generic version of the drug, called Kaletra. The government contends that it can make the drug for 68 cents a pill, almost half the $1.17 that it is paying Abbott for the medication. The country's health minister, Humberto Costa, said late Friday that the government decided to break the patent after Abbott refused to lower its price voluntarily or allow Brazil to make a cheaper version of the drug. Abbott, which is based in Abbott Park, Ill., now has 10 days to present a counteroffer before Brazil officially breaks the patent. If it does not, Mr. Costa said Brazil would pay the company a 3 percent royalty on the generic version of the drug, as required by the World Trade Organization. Abbott criticized the move, arguing that Brazil already receives the drug at the lowest price in the world outside of humanitarian programs in Africa. "The Brazilian government does not have a legal basis to issue a compulsory license for Kaletra on the grounds of public interest or national emergency," it said. Still, the company did not say how it would respond to Brazil's decision, saying only that it remained willing to work with the government to find a "mutually agreeable solution."

At least 13 patients have died since 1975 taking the drug, known as Cylert or pemoline, according to the group. Reports given to the Food and Drug Administration show that at least 193 patients have suffered serious consequences from the drug, said Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy director of the group, Public Citizen. Advertisement Dr. Lurie said that several newer drugs worked as well as Cylert without its potentially lethal side effects. "This is an outmoded drug," he said, "and there is no reason for it to be still on the market." Melissa Brotz, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said the company planned to discontinue selling its version of the drug "in the next several months" because of declining sales. A spokesman for the drug agency said the petition would be reviewed. Copycat versions of the drug are also sold by generic-drug manufacturers. Sales of all versions have declined substantially since 1999, when the drug agency stiffened warnings on the drug's label. Last year, doctors in the United States wrote about 117,000 prescriptions for Cylert and its generic equivalents, the petition said. Britain and Canada removed the drug from the market, but the F.D.A. instead twice chose to stiffen warnings on the drug's label, the petition said. In 1996, the agency sent a letter to Abbott saying that the drug's marketing could continue "if and only if a good faith effort is made on your part to collect the data necessary" to measure the drug's risks. The agency suggested that Abbott create a patient registry for this task, the letter stated. But Abbott never created a registry, the petition stated. Ms. Brotz of Abbott said that she did not know about a registry but that all patients for whom the drug was prescribed must sign a consent form. Cylert originally appealed to doctors because it was given once a day, the petition said. But other drugs for children with attention-deficit disorder now offer once-daily dosing, An F.D.A. analysis concluded that Cylert increased the risk of liver failure almost 17 times, the petition stated. A 2002 agency report found that stiffer label warnings had failed to prompt doctors to increase testing of patients' livers, the petition stated. Most drugs withdrawn over the past 14 years were taken off the market because patients continued to die even after the drug agency stiffened warnings on labels. Doctors and patients often ignore or fail to heed such warnings, sometimes resulting in dire consequences. Dr. Lurie said Public Citizen had wanted for some time to file a petition about Cylert but was only recently able to complete the task. Many drugs linger on the market long after newer, safer drugs have been introduced that render the older drugs obsolete, Dr. Lurie said. The drug agency should undertake a comprehensive review of these medications and ban those with unacceptable risks, he said. In 33 years, Public Citizen has filed more than two dozen petitions to ban drugs. It recently asked the agency to ban Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering drug made by AstraZeneca. The agency rejected the petition on Crestor, saying the drug's risks were not substantially different from those of similar drugs.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/19/business/19abbott.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott Earnings Rise 8.8% on Strong Sales of 2 Drugs<date>Published: January 19, 2005</date><text>he medical products maker Abbott Laboratories reported an 8.8 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday led by surges in its self-injectable rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira and the painkiller Mobic. Sales of Humira were up 130 percent in the quarter, and sales of Mobic, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, rose 176 percent. The company said Mobic was helped by the withdrawal of the Merck painkiller Vioxx and studies linking two Pfizer drugs, Celebrex and Bextra, to heart problems. The company also said that sales of its lipid-regulating drug TriCor increased 39.6 percent in the quarter. TriCor, which works on triglycerides, might have benefited from studies showing that it is particularly effective when used in combination with cholesterol-lowering statins. Advertisement Abbott, based in North Chicago, Ill., said its fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations were $974.6 million, or 62 cents a share including one-time charges, compared with $894.2 million, or 57 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $5.65 billion, up from $4.9 billion in the quarter a year earlier. For the year, the company reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.18 billion, or $2.02 a share, up from $2.5 billion, or $1.59 a share a year earlier. Sales for the year were $19.7 billion. The figures do not include results from Hospira, the hospital products unit that was spun off in April 2004. Abbott said it anticipated sales growth of 10 percent to 12 percent for 2005 and said it expected earnings per share of 57 cents to 59 cents for the quarter. An analyst at SG Cowen Securities, Sara Michelmore, said that, over all, the company's picture looked positive when compared with that of other large pharmaceutical companies. "I think the fundamentals are still pretty good." Ms. Michelmore said. "I think they're going to put up pretty nice growth relative to other large-cap pharmaceuticals. It's going to be double-digit growth." But Ms. Michelmore said that because Abbott markets Mobic jointly with the German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, it is a low-margin product, creating what she called a "negative margin mix" that confuses the picture. The company said that fourth-quarter sales increases were partly offset by the declining popularity of the acid-reducer Prevacid, in part because of competition from Procter &amp; Gamble's over-the-counter version of Prilosec. Abbott also said promotional costs for Humira had been high and that revenue from Mobic would decline even further when its co-marketing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim shifts to a less lucrative distribution agreement this year. Abbott shares closed yesterday at $46.04, down 21 cents.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/national/12drug.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Companies Plan Price Cutsfor 275 Prescription Drugs<date>Published: January 12, 2005</date><text>ASHINGTON, Jan. 11 - Ten major pharmaceutical companies said on Tuesday that they were joining in a new program to cut 25 percent to 40 percent from the retail prices of prescription drugs sold to uninsured people of modest means younger than 65. The drug makers, like many Democrats in Congress, painted a grim picture of life without health insurance, saying that millions of Americans went without life-saving drugs because they lacked coverage. Advertisement People who enroll in the new program, known as Together Rx Access, will receive plastic cards that can be used to obtain substantial savings at local drugstores. The program is the latest effort by drug makers to meet public demand for their products while dispelling public anger about the prices. The federal government has no role in the program, but Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, joined drug company executives at a news conference announcing the initiative. "I'm sure there are some cynics out there who will say that this is not enough," Mr. Thompson said. "But it's an exciting opportunity to provide more people with access to prescription medicines." The number of uninsured Americans has been rising at a brisk pace, reaching 45 million in 2003, the last year for which official figures are available. Sponsors of the new card estimated that 36 million of those uninsured would be eligible for it. But experience with other discount cards, including those endorsed by the government for Medicare beneficiaries, suggests that the number of those who sign up will be much lower. Many consumers say they have been confused by similar cards and disappointed with the savings. Pfizer already offers a 30-day supply of many of its drugs to certain Medicare beneficiaries for a flat fee of $15, about a fifth of the average price charged to a person with no insurance. J. Patrick Kelly, a vice president of Pfizer, said the existing card "has not had a material impact" on the company's earnings. He added that "we do not expect the Together Rx Access card" to have an adverse effect on earnings either. "As much as we want people to take advantage of these programs," he said, "the uptake has been slow." Several consumer groups voiced support for the new program, while emphasizing that it was no substitute for comprehensive health insurance. The new program offers savings on 275 drugs including Crestor and Lipitor, for high cholesterol; Norvasc, for high blood pressure; Nexium, for heartburn and ulcers; Viagra, for erectile dysfunction; and Zoloft and Paxil, for depression. The companies participating in the new program are Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda and TAP Pharmaceutical Products. Industry officials said that if the cards worked as intended, they could reduce the public clamor for legislation to allow the import of low-cost drugs from Canada and elsewhere. People can qualify for the cards if they are younger than 65 and not eligible for Medicare, if they have no public or private coverage for drug costs and if their incomes do not exceed certain levels. The limit is $30,000 for an individual, $40,000 for a couple, $50,000 for a family of three and $60,000 for a family of four. Roba J. Whiteley, executive director of Together Rx Access, said that each company decided which of its drugs would be offered in the program and what level of savings would be provided. Mr. Kelly, of Pfizer, said that the savings to consumers resulted from discounts offered by pharmacists as well as manufacturers. Thus, he said, a person may be charged different prices for the same prescription at different drugstores. Ms. Whiteley said a majority of pharmacies nationwide would accept the card by mid-February. But she said she could not name any participating chain drugstores because "negotiations are still under way." The legal and economic arrangements for the new program are complex. Each of the 10 drug makers has agreed to provide a subsidy - 15 percent of the list price, or wholesale acquisition cost - on drugs bought with the card. If drugstores want to participate, they must agree to limits on what they will be paid for various drugs. These limits set a cap on the combined payment from the drug manufacturer and the consumer.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E2D91330F932A15751C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=abbottlaboratories">COMPANY NEWS; COURT TELLS ABBOTT TO RAISE ROYALTIES PAID FOR DRUG<date>Published: December 21, 2004</date><text>A British court has ruled that Abbott Laboratories must increase royalties paid to Cambridge Antibody Technology on sales of the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.

Thomas Watkins, who spent nearly 20 years with Abbott Laboratories, as its new chief executive, to guide the company as it changes from a discoverer of genes to a developer of pharmaceuticals. Mr. Watkins, whose appointment is expected to be announced today, will succeed William A. Haseltine, the bold-talking scientist and founder of the company, who left last month after first announcing plans to step down in March. Advertisement Under Dr. Haseltine, Human Genome got off to an early start in the race to discover genes involved in disease. But the company, based in Rockville, Md., had setbacks developing drugs based on its discoveries. So Dr. Haseltine and the company's board decided the company needed a leader with commercial pharmaceutical experience. "I will not come close to filling his shoes technically," Mr. Watkins said of Dr. Haseltine. "I am in many ways the opposite of Bill. I'm a professional manager." Mr. Watkins, 51, said in an interview that he did not yet see the need for major changes, just more focus and efficiency. But he did say he would consider trying to get a product on the market quickly by licensing a drug or buying a company. Human Genome's own drugs are still in early or midstage clinical trials. Mr. Watkins most recent position with Abbott was the president of TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a joint venture of Abbott and Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan. During his tenure from September 1998 until this August, TAP's sales doubled to $4 billion. But in 2001 the company also pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of fraud relating to the marketing of its prostate cancer drug and paid a penalty of $875 million, at the time the largest ever for health care fraud. Argeris N. Karabelas, chairman of Human Genome, said the board satisfied itself that any fraudulent activities occurred before Mr. Watkins got to TAP. "Certainly they would not have kept Tom in the role if he had responsibility," said Dr. Karabelas, a venture capitalist in Princeton, N.J.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EEDB143DF935A15753C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=abbottlaboratories">COMPANY NEWS; ABBOTT BUYS FRENCH MAKER OF SPINE-TREATMENT DEVICE<date>Published: October 26, 2004</date><text>Abbott Laboratories, the health care company, said yesterday that it had acquired a privately held company, Spine Next of France, for $60 million to bolster its spinal products line.

My parents divorced when I was 2. In eighth grade, I changed from a Las Vegas private school to Culver Military Academy, in Indiana, which was a defining growth experience. This was in the middle of the Vietnam War, and military academies were not popular. What I took away from it was Culver's servant leadership model: that a leader serves his charges, the people he's responsible for, first, before anything else. That makes a big difference in the way I approach a lot of things.My father and I used to go fishing in Canada, to this unbelievably remote place by floatplane, and spend the week. He always wore vests with lots of pockets, and whatever was needed, he had it.One time, he and I were in a boat far from camp. The boat's motor broke down, and we were stuck. As he took the engine apart, it was clear the spark plug had broken. He had one in his pocket, a spare, with a spark-plug wrench. And I remember thinking, how could you anticipate that?That lesson was very powerful. I try to anticipate the consequences, all the outcomes, all the things you're not thinking about.When my dad was dying of cancer, he asked me -- a middle kid -- to be executor. I told him I'd only do that if he left me nothing, because the only way you can referee is not to have a stake in it.It worked out pretty well. In the end, there were only two things I wanted -- a sculpture of a hunter, which I'd given him, and his fishing gear. So I got his five tackle boxes, and all that stuff that used to be in his pockets, right down to the folded-up toilet paper for the emergency situation; this ball of twine; the funnel for pouring gas; this set of waterproof matches -- you name it.I was one of those kids who ended up being elected captain of the team, president of the club, whatever. My senior year at Stanford, I was financial manager of all the student businesses. It was like a mini-C.E.O. job, and I was the first undergraduate to hold the position. At that point, I decided to go on to business school.But in business school, I was uncertain about what I wanted to do. So I postponed making a decision, joined McKinsey, the consulting firm, and waited to see what interested me. Marvin Bower, one of the founders, would speak to the introductory training program for new hires. His message was ''Be a builder,'' and why that's a noble way of looking at your role in serving a client.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/business/price-of-aids-drug-intensifies-debate-on-legal-imports.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Price of AIDS Drug Intensifies Debate On Legal Imports<date>Published: April 14, 2004</date><text>The recent decision by Abbott Laboratories to quintuple the price of its crucial AIDS drug Norvir will be at the center of a federal hearing today in which AIDS groups and consumer advocates plan to argue that the government should begin allowing the import of cheaper drugs.The hearing, which will be conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, is a result of last fall's Medicare drug legislation, in which Congress called for a general inquiry into the import question. But the escalating protest over Norvir, whose average annual dosage cost rose to about $7,800 in January from $1,500, has suddenly given the import issue unexpected urgency.Norvir is a vital ingredient in many of the drug ''cocktail'' regimens prescribed for tens of thousands of AIDS patients. Abbott, which cannot raise its prices overseas where governments control drug markets, says it has had to raise prices in the United States to continue financing its research into H.I.V. and other diseases.Norvir will also be the focus of a hearing that has yet to be scheduled. At that session, the National Institutes of Health will hear arguments over whether federal health authorities should take the unusual step of allowing generic versions of Norvir years before Abbott's patents expire.In the cases of drugs that were developed with federal money -- as Norvir was -- the government has long held the right to demand ''reasonable'' prices, but has never done so.''The taxpayers already paid for this invention, so if anything it should be cheaper in the United States,'' said James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a group that pushes for lower drug prices.Mr. Love plans to testify at today's hearing, as do a number of consumer advocates and members of AIDS groups who have protested Abbott's pricing of Norvir.With total sales of more than $1 billion since its introduction in 1996, Norvir long ago became profitable for Abbott. But with the recent price increase, the thousands of Americans who use Norvir now pay 10 times what the price is in Europe, where drug prices are regulated under national health care plans. An annual Norvir dosage in Belgium, for example, costs less than $720 a year.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/13/business/company-news-abbott-to-give-its-holders-shares-in-hospira.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">COMPANY NEWS; ABBOTT TO GIVE ITS HOLDERS SHARES IN HOSPIRA<date>Published: April 13, 2004</date><text>Abbott Laboratories will give stockholders one share of its Hospira hospital-products unit for every 10 Abbott shares they own when the business is spun off this month.

Morgan. TAP, a partnership of Abbott and Takeda Chemical Industries of Japan, sells the heartburn drug Prevacid and the prostate cancer drug Lupron; sales of both declined in the fourth quarter.Abbott officials said that sales from TAP would rise only modestly in 2004.Abbott said quarterly earnings increased to $944.4 million, or 60 cents a share, from $627 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Excluding special items, it earned 65 cents a share, matching the average forecast from analysts surveyed by Reuters Research, a unit of the Reuters Group.Abbott's global sales rose 14.3 percent, to $5.53 billion, but growth would have been 9.9 percent if not for the benefit of the weak dollar, which helps increase the value of sales outside the United States when translated back into dollars.Sales growth was helped by the early-2003 introduction of Humira, an injectable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that had quarterly global revenue of $119 million.Abbott said it expected 2004 earnings of $2.40 to $2.48 a share, excluding special items, or 9 percent to 12 percent above 2003 profit.

But Christina Pearson, a spokeswoman for the department, said yesterday that it was not clear when the advertisements would begin.Today, Kevin Keane, the department's assistant secretary for public affairs, plans to meet with a group of breastfeeding experts who have been working on the campaign to discuss changes to the ads, according to people invited to the meeting. The campaign includes television, radio and print public service announcements.The original campaign focused on ''the risks associated with not breastfeeding,'' according to the Ad Council's newsletter, and included statistics from studies that have found that babies fed formula have a higher risk of developing asthma, diabetes, leukemia and other illnesses.According to the newsletter, one planned spot, titled ''Roller Derby,'' showed pregnant women roller skating. The voiceover said: ''You'd never take risks while you're pregnant. Why start when the baby's born?''Ms. Pearson said that the information in the newsletter was preliminary and should have not been released.Peter Paradossi, a spokesman for Mead Johnson, the Bristol-Myers Squibb division that makes Enfamil formulas, said that the company supported a campaign to promote the benefits of breastfeeding, but that the planned ads went too far.''We worried it would give an impression that infant formula is unhealthy and potentially dangerous,'' he said.Tracey Noe, a spokeswoman for Ross Products, the Abbott Laboratories unit that makes Similac, said her company also supported projects promoting breastfeeding. But she said Ross executives were concerned that claims made in the government's campaign were not based on solid science. ''The overall approach was like a scare tactic,'' Ms. Noe said.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/29/business/company-news-abbott-laboratories-unit-to-pay-200-million.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">COMPANY NEWS; ABBOTT LABORATORIES UNIT TO PAY $200 MILLION<date>Published: October 29, 2003</date><text>An Abbott Laboratories subsidiary has been sentenced to pay $200 million because its employees tried to help undercover agents defraud Medicare and Medicaid.

The Boston ruling involves a consolidated lawsuit against the pharmaceutical industry by consumers, health plans and state attorneys general who say the drug companies tell the government that they charge doctors more than they do, inflating reimbursements.

From 1.3 percent to 1.5 percent of people in the United States suffer from bipolar disorder, and their risk of committing suicide is estimated to be 10 to 20 times that of the rest of the population.Perhaps because patients are more likely to seek medical help when they are depressed than when they are manic, the disorder is often misdiagnosed at first as depression alone, but antidepressants are not the correct treatment for bipolar disorder and may in fact make it worse.The new study, published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, found that patients taking Depakote were 2.7 times as likely to kill themselves as those taking lithium. Earlier studies by others had also found that lithium could prevent suicide, but today's report is the first to compare suicide and attempted suicide rates in lithium and Depakote users. The study was based on medical records of 20,638 patients aged 14 and older in Washington State and California who were treated from 1994 to 2001.Solvay Pharmaceuticals, a maker of lithium, paid for the study, but did not influence the findings or the way they were reported, the authors said.The study included 53 actual suicides and 383 attempted suicides that led to hospitalization. But the researchers, as well as Depakote's manufacturer, cautioned that because this study was based only on patients' records, it was not conclusive.Precisely how lithium might prevent suicide is not known, although it is believed to help regulate levels of serotonin, a brain chemical that influences mood.''Lithium is clearly being underutilized,'' said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, the senior author of the study and director of the psychopharmacology research center at George Washington University Medical Center. The drug can save lives, he said, adding, ''The real tragedy is that a lot of young psychiatrists have never learned to use lithium.''</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/business/company-news-abbott-given-approval-to-sell-arthritis-drug-in-europe.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">COMPANY NEWS; ABBOTT GIVEN APPROVAL TO SELL ARTHRITIS DRUG IN EUROPE<date>Published: September 11, 2003</date><text>Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that it had received approval to market its new drug for rheumatoid arthritis, Humira, in the European Union.

White, said he did not have another deal in mind, he refused to promise the spinoff would be his last.Some analysts have speculated that Abbott's $3.4 billion nutritional business -- which includes the Ensure and Similac brands -- could be the next to go.''Nutritionals are certainly less of a strategic fit within Abbott than the hospital products business, and they'd be much easier to separate,'' said Michael N. Weinstein, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. ''But the hospital products business isn't nearly as profitable as the nutritionals business.''In a conference call with analysts, Mr. White said the company's core business included pharmaceutical and medical products.Abbott has yet to come up with a name for the hospital products company. It will have $2.5 billion in sales, 14,000 employees, 5,000 customers and 15 manufacturing sites. Its products will include electronic drug-delivery systems, generic drug manufacturing and a grab bag of other products that seemed to have been picked because their future prospects are dim.''Many of the products in the split-out are in many cases mature or generic,'' Mr. White said.The spinoff, he said, had nothing to do with the company's problems with the Food and Drug Administration.In 1999, the company was forced to pay a $100 million fine, then a record, and cease production of numerous products because of manufacturing problems. The company still operates under a consent decree, which gives the F.D.A. considerable sway over some of its operations.Abbott hopes to resolve the decree by the end of the year, Mr. White said. The company's previous predictions about a resolution with the F.D.A., however, proved inaccurate.''We're confident, but I'm a cautious person now about trying to predict anything here,'' Mr. White said. ''We thought we were pretty ready and finished the last time, too.''Abbott Laboratories will grow faster and have higher profit margins after the spinoff, Mr. White said. Abbott plans to issue bonds, take the money and saddle the new company with the debt -- a common practice in such spinoffs.Abbott does not yet know how much debt it will issue, but Mr. White said it would be investment-grade.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/25/business/company-news-abbott-laboratories-to-buy-maker-of-nutrition-bars.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">COMPANY NEWS; ABBOTT LABORATORIES TO BUY MAKER OF NUTRITION BARS<date>Published: July 25, 2003</date><text>The medical products maker Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire ZonePerfect Nutrition for $160 million in cash, hoping to counter weak sales of its nutritional products.

The lawsuit follows one filed in Los Angeles last month by Amgen, the nation's largest biotechnology company, and another filed in San Francisco in April by Genentech, the second largest.The suits say Columbia abused the patent system by obtaining a new patent covering the same invention that an expired patent had covered. The suits seek to invalidate the new patent and establish that the companies do not owe any more money to Columbia.''We've paid them hundreds of millions of dollars for that invention,'' said Thomas J. DesRosier, general counsel of Genzyme, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass. He was referring to payments by the industry as a whole. ''Under our patent laws we don't think it's appropriate that we have to pay them again.''Robert Kasdin, senior executive vice president at Columbia, said the university had not seen the latest lawsuit and could not comment on it. But in general, he said, the university denies the charge and would not have received the new patent unless the United States Patent and Trademark Office decided that it contained new intellectual property.In the late 1970's, Columbia scientists, led by Richard Axel, developed a technique useful for genetically engineering animal cells to make them produce biotech drugs like interferon, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis. The first patent, issued in 1983, was licensed by numerous companies and became one of the most lucrative ever held by a university, earning royalty payments of about $100 million a year in its final years. Columbia used the royalties to support university research.The patent expired in August 2000. Before it did, Columbia tried to get Congress to extend the patent for 14 to 18 months. But after the biotechnology industry objected, the effort failed. The industry thought that was the end of the matter.But the university had also applied for additional patents, a technique commonly used by businesses. One application, filed in 1995, led to a patent issued last September. The university is now saying that companies must pay royalties on the new patent, which will last for 17 years.Biotech drugs are proteins that are commonly produced by putting the gene for the protein into Chinese hamster ovary cells, which then churn out the protein. The Columbia scientists developed a method to determine which animal cells take up the gene for the drug.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/11/business/abbott-reports-steep-profit-drop-after-a-charge.html?ref=abbottlaboratories">Abbott Reports Steep Profit Drop After a Charge<date>Published: July 11, 2003</date><text>Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that its quarterly profit fell 58 percent, as strong sales of arthritis and H.I.V. drugs offset a charge to settle an investigation into suspected marketing kickbacks and insurance fraud.Abbott said third-quarter earnings would lag Wall Street estimates as it spends to promote Humira, a drug it recently introduced for rheumatoid arthritis.The company reported second-quarter net earnings of $247 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with $592 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.Abbott said late last month that it would take a charge of $622 million, or 34 cents a share after tax, to settle an investigation into the marketing of products by its Ross Products nutritional unit.The federal government began investigating Ross Products in 2001, accusing it and rivals of defrauding federal and state health insurers by using kickbacks to promote sales of pumps and supplies used to feed seriously ill people.Excluding the charge and other one-time items, the company earned 52 cents a share, matching the forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.Abbott shares closed down 13 cents yesterday, at $43.55.The company said second-quarter sales rose 9.5 percent, to $4.72 billion, with 3.7 percent of the gain resulting from favorable currency exchanges.Sales of prescription drugs in the United States rose 27 percent, to $1.26 billion, mostly because of increased demand for the H.I.V. treatment Kaletra, the epilepsy drug Depakote and the prostate treatment Flomax.

Abbott sued Baxter to block Food and Drug Administration approval of the proposed generic drug, claiming it would infringe on an Abbott patent for a method to improve the shelf life of sevoflurane, the active ingredient in Ultane.Baxter received approval to sell the generic version, although it had delayed selling the drug while awaiting the ruling by the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, a Baxter spokeswoman, Deborah Spak, said. The release of the generic version, she said, ''was not something built into any timeline.''A federal judge in Chicago had thrown out the suit, saying the Baxter generic version had a water content different from what was covered by the patent.

At the time, news reports described it as focusing on marketing tactics in which the company gave tubes and pumps used to deliver liquid food directly into patients' digestive tracts in exchange for large orders of the liquids.Some of the hospitals and nursing homes that received the free equipment were suspected of billing Medicaid and Medicare, the government health insurance programs for the poor and the elderly, for the tubes and pumps, according to the reports.Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., noted that patient safety was never an issue in the investigations.Ms. Brotz said the settlement, which a judge still must approve, would resolve all aspects of the investigation, which stemmed from an industrywide inquiry by prosecutors in the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of Illinois.The payment is the latest the company has made to settle fines stemming from federal investigations.In 1999, the company paid what was then a record fine of $100 million to the Food and Drug Administration to settle a long-running investigation into the company's manufacturing plant in Lake County, Ill. Abbott also agreed to remove 125 products from the market and stop making them.On Oct. 3, 2001, TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a joint venture of Abbott and Tadeka Chemical Industries, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and paid $875 million -- still the record for a health fraud fine -- to settle accusations related to its marketing of the cancer drug Lupron. TAP was accused of giving Lupron to doctors who the company knew would bill Medicaid and Medicare for the cost of the drug.The criminal investigation into TAP is continuing. More than a dozen current and former employees have been charged with conspiracy to pay kickbacks to doctors. One employee has pleaded guilty; the rest are contesting the charges.Correction: July 3, 2003, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about plans by Abbott Laboratories to settle an investigation into its sales practices misspelled the name of its partner in a joint venture, TAP Pharmaceutical Products, which earlier settled accusations related to the marketing of a cancer drug. It is Takeda Chemical Industries, not Tadeka.</text></article></page></root>
