The third-quarter profit jumped from a year ago, but was lower than the second quarter and fell short of Wall Street expectations, which had already been lowered because of a slump in global metal prices. Alcoa’s chief financial officer, Chuck McLane, said in a conference call that worries about Europe’s debt crisis prompted customers there to reduce orders sharply, even into September. The first Dow component company to report third-quarter results, Alcoa said earnings were $172 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said income from continuing operations was also 15 cents a share, but down from 28 cents a share in the second quarter. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 22 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Alcoa said revenue rose 21 percent, to $6.4 billion from a year earlier, but was 3 percent lower than the second quarter of this year as metals prices slumped sharply. Aluminum prices fell almost 20 percent in the third quarter on global economic concerns, and Alcoa’s share price fell 41 percent during the same period. Still, aluminum prices could easily rebound if the sentiment about the European economy showed any improvement, analysts said, which would immediately benefit Alcoa.Alcoa, the aluminum producer, said slowing economic growth sent prices for the metal lower, hurting its third-quarter profit.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/business/david-reynolds-leader-of-metals-company-dies-at-96.html?ref=alcoainc">David Reynolds, Leader of Metals Company, Dies at 96<date>Published: August 31, 2011</date><text>David P. Reynolds, a metals manufacturing executive who helped bring aluminum foil and aluminum beverage cans into the American kitchen, died on Monday in Richmond, Va. He was 96.His death was confirmed by his daughter Margaret Mackell. Mr. Reynolds was the last member of his family to lead Reynolds Metals, which was founded in 1919 by his father, Richard S. Reynolds Sr., and grew to become the nation’s second-largest aluminum manufacturer behind Alcoa. Reynolds was sold to Alcoa in 2000, five years after Mr. Reynolds stepped down from its board. Mr. Reynolds joined the family business as a salesman out of college in 1937 and began trying to persuade the major St. Louis breweries to affix aluminum labels to their beer bottles. Almost 50 years later, at 71, he retired as Reynolds’s chairman and chief executive, positions he held for a decade. Mr. Reynolds oversaw the development of aluminum products for the aerospace, automotive and construction industries. But he was best known for bringing the metal to a mass consumer audience. As aluminum sales slowed after World War II, Mr. Reynolds and his brothers hoped to avoid a glut by aggressively promoting aluminum’s use in consumer goods and packaging. Aluminum foil had been sold since the 1920s, largely as an industrial product, but Mr. Reynolds saw an opportunity for Reynolds Wrap to become a household staple. He developed television commercials to show how aluminum foil could be used in cooking. He arranged demonstrations to educate consumers on how to wrap leftovers. “David was really the big pusher of Reynolds Wrap,” said Randolph Reynolds, a nephew, who worked at Reynolds Metals for 32 years. Aluminum beer cans made their debut in the late 1950s, and the Reynolds company was quick to take notice. It began manufacturing 12-ounce aluminum cans for the Theodore Hamm Brewing Company of Minnesota in 1963, and four years later it introduced the first aluminum cans for Pepsi and Diet Pepsi. Today, more than half of all beverages sold in American supermarkets come in aluminum packaging. “It was very important in helping build the American soft drink business,” said John Sicher, the publisher of Beverage Digest. “It provided consumers with a lightweight, low-cost and highly recyclable package.” Mr. Reynolds earned a reputation as an environmentalist — promoting the re-use of aluminum as a solution to litter and waste. In 1987, he received an award from the organization Keep America Beautiful for pioneering efforts in recycling. David Parham Reynolds was born on June 16, 1915, in Bristol, Tenn. He graduated in 1934 from the Lawrenceville School, where he was captain of the football team. Four years later, he graduated from Princeton University and joined his three older brothers — William, Richard Jr. and J. Louis — at Reynolds Metals. Mr. Reynolds, who lost an eye playing polo during his junior year at Princeton, owned dozens of thoroughbred racehorses, including Tabasco Cat, who won the 1994 Preakness and Belmont Stakes, the final two legs of the Triple Crown. In retirement, Mr. Reynolds lived at his homes in Richmond, Del Ray Beach, Fla., and Wequetonsing, Mich. His wife, the former Margaret Harrison, died in 1992. In addition to his daughter Margaret Mackell of Richmond, survivors include two daughters, Julie Swords of Lexington, Ky., and Dorothy Brotherton, also of Richmond; six grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Beyond beverage cans and kitchen wrap, Mr. Reynolds promoted the use of aluminum in everyday life and frequently tested ideas on his family. The Reynolds house was outfitted with an aluminum solar-paneled roof; an aluminum Christmas tree graced their home during the holidays; and the family freezer was stocked with foil-wrapped ice cream from the Eskimo Pie Company, a subsidiary of the family metals business. Mr. Reynolds even gave his wife aluminum jewelry, something she wore sparingly, preferring more precious metals.David P. Reynolds, a metals manufacturing executive who helped bring aluminum foil and aluminum beverage cans into the American kitchen, died on Monday in Richmond, Va.

Sales gained 27 percent to $6.59 billion, exceeding the $6.31 billion average estimate of seven analysts in the Bloomberg survey. Earnings, excluding $38 million in restructuring and debt tender offer costs and other one-time items, were $364 million, or 32 cents a share, missing the 33-cent average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. “The market should be pleased that Alcoa is showing these strong year-over-year trends,” Jorge Beristain, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said on Bloomberg TV. “They are managing to hold the line on costs.” Alcoa’s chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, reiterated his forecast for global demand to increase by 12 percent in 2011 and double by the end of the decade as Asian countries build more offices and buy more aircraft, cars and trains. “Although the economic recovery is uneven, the overall outlook for Alcoa — and for aluminum — remains positive,” Mr. Kleinfeld said in a statement. “Demand for aluminum continues to rise and so does growth in our major markets.” Alcoa, traditionally the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings, was little changed in after-hours trading. Aluminum prices have advanced in the last year in London as demand soared from Chinese and American automotive and aerospace sectors.

Lancz &amp; Associates investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio. “They’ve really improved margins as much as they can, and if you don’t get the top-line growth now or it doesn’t meet expectations, that leaves the market vulnerable.” Net income for the first quarter was $308 million, or 27 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $201 million, or 20 cents a share in the quarter last year, the company said. Income from continuing operations, which excludes special items, was 28 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates for 27 cents a share. “Our outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond remains very positive due to the world’s growing population” and increasing urbanization, the chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said in the earnings statement. Shares of Alcoa slipped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. They also declined 15 cents, or 0.84 percent, to $17.77, in regular trading.

Net income was 24 cents a share. Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.7 billion, said the company which is traditionally the first Dow component to report in the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 19 cents a share and revenue of $5.71 billion. Alcoa said improved earnings were driven by higher pricing, continued strengthening in most end markets and improved productivity as a result of cost-cutting measures. Results were offset somewhat by a weaker dollar and higher energy and raw material costs, it said. Aluminum prices, which slumped significantly during the recession, rose 11 percent last year — 5 percent in the fourth quarter alone — and are now near a two-year peak. “In 2011, we see aluminum growing another 12 percent on top of last year’s 13-percent improvement,” the chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said. “We are well positioned to outpace the recovery in the markets we serve.” Bridget Freas, an analyst at Morningstar, said she was not surprised by Alcoa’s strong earnings. “They’ve done a good job at improving margins and have cut overhead,” Ms. Freas said. “Of course, the better aluminum pricing was what drove the higher-than-expected earnings.” “I think it’s a good sign that they expect global growth up 12 percent this year. It’s optimistic, but reasonable.”The aluminum producer, Alcoa, reported a jump in fourth-quarter profit on Monday, topping Wall Street estimates as aluminum prices and demand rose after two years in the doldrums.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/business/08alcoa.html?ref=alcoainc">Alcoa’s Profit Surpasses Estimates<date>Published: October 7, 2010</date><text>The aluminum producer Alcoa said on Thursday that its third-quarter profit topped Wall Street estimates and that it had increased its outlook for global aluminum demand.Alcoa raised its 2010 global aluminum consumption forecast to 13 percent from 12 percent, noting growing demand for the metal in countries like China and Russia. Net income was $61 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with $77 million or 8 cents a share in the quarter a year ago, the company said, citing a drop in the price of aluminum and a weaker dollar. The results included a negative impact for special items of $35 million, or 3 cents a share. Profit from continuing operations was 9 cents a share, said Alcoa, traditionally the first of the Dow Jones industrial average components to issue quarterly figures. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of 5 cents a share. Sales rose 15 percent to $5.3 billion on higher volumes in aerospace and increased market share in the building and construction market. Analyst Charles A. Bradford of the Affiliated Research Group in New York said the results were better than expected because of cost reductions. “But the metal’s price was pretty obvious. The fourth-quarter metals price ought to be a fair bit better.” Alcoa’s chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said the company had strong performance in its mid- and downstream businesses. While Alcoa shares have bounced higher, they have not kept up with the rising metal price over the past six months. In after-hours trading, shares rose as high as $12.62 from their close of $12.20 in regular trading.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/business/economy/26earnings.html?ref=alcoainc">Companies Wringing Huge Profits From Job Cuts<date>Published: July 25, 2010</date><text>By most measures, Harley-Davidson has been having a rough ride.Motorcycle sales are falling in 2010, as they have for each of the last three years. The company does not expect a turnaround anytime soon. But despite that drought, Harley’s profits are rising — soaring, in fact. Last week, Harley reported a $71 million profit in the second quarter, more than triple what it earned a year ago. This seeming contradiction — falling sales and rising profits — is one reason the mood on Wall Street is so much more buoyant than in households, where pessimism runs deep and joblessness shows few signs of easing. Many companies are focusing on cost-cutting to keep profits growing, but the benefits are mostly going to shareholders instead of the broader economy, as management conserves cash rather than bolstering hiring and production. Harley, for example, has announced plans to cut 1,400 to 1,600 more jobs by the end of next year. That is on top of 2,000 job cuts last year — more than a fifth of its work force. As companies this month report earnings for the second quarter, news of healthy profits has helped the stock market — the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index is up 7 percent for July — but the source of those gains raises deep questions about the sustainability of the growth, as well as the fate of more than 14 million unemployed workers hoping to rejoin the work force as the economy recovers. “Because of high unemployment, management is using its leverage to get more hours out of workers,” said Robert C. Pozen, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and the former president of Fidelity Investments. “What’s worrisome is that American business has gotten used to being a lot leaner, and it could take a while before they start hiring again.” And some of those businesses, including Harley-Davidson, are preparing for a future where they can prosper even if sales do not recover. Harley’s goal is to permanently be in a position to generate strong profits on a lower revenue base. In some ways, the ability to raise profits in the face of declining sales is a triumph of productivity that makes the United States more globally competitive. The problem is that companies are not investing those earnings, instead letting cash pile up to levels not reached in nearly half a century. “As long as corporations are reinvesting, the economy can grow,” said Ethan Harris, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “But if they’re taking those profits and saving them, rather than buying new equipment, it hurts overall growth. The longer this goes on, the more you worry about income being diverted to a sector that’s not spending.” “There’s no question that there is an income shift going on in the economy,” Mr. Harris added. “Companies are squeezing their labor costs to build profits.” The trend is hardly limited to Harley. Giants like General Electric and JPMorgan Chase, as well as smaller companies like Hasbro, the toymaker, all improved their bottom lines despite slowing sales in the second quarter. Among the S.&amp; P. 500 companies that have reported second-quarter results, more than one in 10 had higher profits on lower sales, nearly twice the number in a typical quarter before the recession, according to Thomson Reuters. “Whole industries are operating at new levels of profitability,” said David J. Kostin, chief United States equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. “In the downturn, companies managed to maintain higher profit margins than ever before.” Profit margins — the percentage of revenue left over after expenses — crumble in most recessions, as overall sales fall but fixed costs like infrastructure, commodities and rent remain the same. In 2002, during the recession that followed the bursting of the technology bubble in addition to the Sept. 11 attacks, margins sank to 4.7 percent. Although the most recent downturn was far more severe, profit margins bottomed out at 5.9 percent in 2009 and quickly rebounded. By next year, analysts expect margins to hit 8.9 percent, a record high. The difference this time is that companies wrung more savings out of their work forces, said Neal Soss, chief economist for Credit Suisse in New York. In fact, while wages and salaries have barely budged from recession lows, profits have staged a vigorous recovery, jumping 40 percent between late 2008 and the first quarter of 2010. Harley-Davidson’s profit gain last quarter was helped by a turnaround in its financing unit, as well as more efficient production, but the company is still cutting. Harley has warned union employees at its Milwaukee factory that it would move production elsewhere in the United States if they did not agree to more flexible work rules and tens of millions in cost-saving measures. Even if sales do improve, a surge in hiring is unlikely. “The last thing we’re worried about is when are we going to have to add more capacity, because what we’re really doing is reconfiguring our entire operational system for greater flexibility,” Keith Wandell, the company’s chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts last week. Harley’s evolution is part of longer-term shift in American manufacturing, said Rod Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. At Ford, revenue in its North American operations is down by $20 billion since 2005, but instead of a loss like it had that year, the unit is expected to earn more than $5 billion in 2010. In large part, that is because Ford has shrunk its North American work force by nearly 50 percent over the last five years. “These companies have cracked the code of a successful industrial turnaround,” Mr. Lache said. “They’re shrinking the business to a size that’s defendable, and growing off that lower base.” To be sure, sales are rising for many companies, albeit at a much slower pace than the increase in profits. Among the 175 companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 that have reported earnings for the second quarter, revenues rose 6.9 percent on average while profits jumped 42.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. Still, even at corporations where both the top and bottom lines are expanding, the focus remains on keeping profits high, not rebuilding work forces decimated by the recession. When Alcoa reported a turnaround this month in profits and a 22 percent jump in revenue, its chief financial officer, Charles D. McLane Jr., assured investors that it was not eager to recall the 37,000 workers let go since late 2008. “We have a tight focus on spending as market activity increases, operating more effectively and minimizing rehires where possible,” he said. “We’re not only holding headcount levels, but are also driving restructuring this quarter that will result in further reductions.” Michael E. Belwood, a spokesman for Alcoa, said more than 17,500 of the former workers were employed at units Alcoa has since sold, but added that the company “had to be resized to match the realities of the recession.” “We’re keeping a close eye on costs because there is still uncertainty about the stability of this recovery,” he said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/business/13alcoa.html?ref=alcoainc">Sales Rise, and Alcoa Posts Profit in Quarter<date>Published: July 12, 2010</date><text>The aluminum producer Alcoa posted a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit Monday and raised its estimate for global aluminum consumption, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-hours trading.The company, whose results are often viewed as a bellwether of the United States economy, cited strength in several industrial sectors and raised its estimate for aluminum consumption this year, even as metal prices have been falling recently. Shares of Alcoa rose more than 3 percent in extended trade after closing at $10.87 in the regular session. “It’s constructive and it helps start the earnings season off on a positive note,” said Brian Hicks, portfolio manager of U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio. “From the standpoint of Alcoa, they see the economy continuing to expand. It’s robust enough that they have to increase their forecast for global aluminum production.” Earnings were $136 million, or 13 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $454 million, or 47 cents in the quarter a year earlier, the company said. Earnings from continuing operations, which excludes one time items, were $137 million, or 13 cents a share. Revenue rose 22 percent, to $5.19 billion from $4.24 billion, Alcoa said. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 11 cents a share and revenue of $5.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. In the quarter, Alcoa said there was a 1 percent increase in third-party prices for alumina — the raw material for aluminum. However, that was offset by a 1 percent decrease in realized prices for the metal. Alcoa said there was strong revenue growth over the first quarter in several markets, in particular in packaging, commercial transportation and building and construction. “The top and bottom line growth was driven by higher volumes from stronger end markets and continued gains from our productivity programs,” the chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said in a statement announcing the results. “Based on this improved end-market demand, we are raising our projection for aluminum consumption from 10 percent to 12 percent this year,” he said. On a conference call with analysts, Mr. Kleinfeld said the biggest risk remained “the volatility that could potentially come from financial markets.” In the last three months, the price of aluminum in London has dropped sharply as weak demand for cars, planes and construction, and uncertainty over the strength of the global recovery have weighed on the metal.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/pactivs-shares-climb-as-2-more-bidders-are-seen/?ref=alcoainc">Pactiv's Shares Climb as 2 More Bidders Are Seen<date>May 19, 2010, 4:53 pm</date><text>Shares of Pactiv, the maker of Hefty trash bags, rose as much as 7 percent on Wednesday after a report that two more companies are interested in buying it.

The company is “facing continued headwinds from energy and currency costs.” An earlier version of this article misstated revenue in the quarter. It declined, it did not increase.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/business/08alcoa.html?ref=alcoainc">Alcoa Posted Profit for 3rd Quarter<date>Published: October 7, 2009</date><text>Alcoa posted a surprise profit Wednesday through cost-cutting and higher aluminum prices after three consecutive quarterly losses.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Alcoa Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » The 120-year-old company, which announced several cost-cutting moves last fall, said it now planned to reduce output by 18 percent this year. It also plans to cut its head count by 13,500 employees, or 13 percent, and expects to eliminate another 1,700 contractor positions. Like many other material producers, Alcoa has struggled to cope with the steep decline in demand for fabricated goods during this economic malaise. Aluminum prices, which rose sharply last summer, have since collapsed as aluminum consumption in crucial areas like automotive and consumer sectors has dropped sharply. Calling the moves “aggressive, but prudent,” Klaus Kleinfeld, the president and chief executive of Alcoa, said the moves were necessary for the firm to try to conserve cash and reduce costs. “These are extraordinary times, requiring speed and decisiveness to address the current economic downturn, and flexibility and foresight to be prepared for future uncertainties in our markets,” Mr. Kleinfeld said. Alcoa said it also planned to sell several unprofitable business lines and was stopping all “noncritical” capital investment programs to try to conserve cash. It is freezing all hiring and salaries through 2009, the firm said. While the company said its cost-cutting programs could save it about $450 million a year before taxes, total charges for the fourth quarter of last year are likely to be $900 million to $950 million, or $1.13 to $1.19 a share. Some Wall Street analysts, however, questioned whether the moves would be enough. “I would have liked to see a little bit bigger cut in smelter output and a little bit bigger cut in capital spending, and I’m not sure they can sell the assets they want to sell,” said Charles Bradford, an analyst with Bradford Research. “People just don’t have a lot of money to buy those assets these days. I’m not so sure how much of this is going to get done.” After ending the day up 26 cents at $12.12, Alcoa’s stock was trading down 42 cents, at $11.70, in after-hours trading. Many of the world’s largest aluminum makers  including the Aluminum Corporation of China  have announced plans to reduce capacity. The hope is that if output is sharply reduced, the price of aluminum will rise above current levels. But many Wall Street analysts say despite the fact that falling energy and freight prices are helping aluminum makers, it is tough for Alcoa and its competitors to make money with aluminum prices at such low levels. It has been a challenging time for Mr. Kleinfeld, who took over the reins of Alcoa last spring from its longtime chief executive, Alain J. P. Belda. Before joining Alcoa as its president, Mr. Kleinfeld headed up the electronics and industrial conglomerate Siemens. In a conference call with analysts last October, Mr. Kleinfeld estimated at that time that one-third of the world’s aluminum capacity was “under water.” As prices continued to fall and inventories rose, analysts at Credit Suisse in December estimated that one-half of the aluminum industry was “losing money at current prices.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 7, 2009, on page B2 of the New York edition.Alcoa, one of the world’s largest aluminum makers, described plans on Tuesday to close plants and slash its work force in an effort to contend with the continued economic downturn.

But while proponents of complete independence face little opposition at home or in Copenhagen, they haven’t been able to overcome one crucial calculation: the country depends on Danish assistance for more than 40 percent of its gross domestic product. “The independence wish has always been there,” says Aleqa Hammond, Greenland’s minister for finance and foreign affairs. “The reason we have never realized it is because of the economics.” Climate change has the power to unsettle boundaries and shake up geopolitics, usually for the worse.

The island’s ice cover has already begun to disappear. “Changes in the ocean eat the ice sheet from underneath,” says Sarah Das, a glaciologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “Warmer water causes the glaciers to calve and melt back more quickly.” Hunters who use the frozen surface of the winter ocean for hunting and travel have found themselves idle when the ice fails to form. The whales, seals and birds they hunt have begun to shift their migratory patterns. “The traditional culture will be hard hit,” says Jesper Madsen, director of the department of Arctic environment at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. “But from an overall perspective, it will have a positive effect.” Greenland’s fishermen are applauding the return of warm-water cod.

Gold and diamond prospectors have flooded the island’s south. Alcoa is preparing to build a large aluminum smelter. The island’s minerals are becoming more accessible even as global commodity prices are soaring. And with more than 80 percent of the land currently iced over, the hope is that the island has just begun to reveal its riches.

And while Greenland is still considered an oil exploration frontier, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Canada’s Husky Energy and Cairn Energy and Sweden’s PA Resources are aleady ramping up exploration. In November, Greenlanders will vote on a referendum that would leverage global warming into a path to independence. The island’s 56,000 predominantly Inuit residents have enjoyed limited home rule since 1978.

Alcoa is the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report results for the quarter through June. Earnings at Dow Jones companies probably declined an average of 10 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Klaus Kleinfeld, who took over as chief executive in May, has raised prices to help make up for rising energy expenses, which account for about a third of the cost of producing aluminum. Alcoa sold aluminum for an average $3,058 a ton in the quarter, about 6.2 percent higher than a year earlier. Net income for the quarter fell to $546 million, or 66 cents a share, from $715 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier, Alcoa said.

Aluminum Bahrain, known as Alba, filed suit Wednesday, accusing Alcoa of steering payments for alumina, the crucial material for making aluminum, to companies abroad to pay kickbacks to a Bahraini government official. The company, which is 77 percent owned by the government of Bahrain, also accused Alcoa of overcharging for alumina. According to the suit filed in Federal District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the bribes were sent through a series of shell companies controlled by Alcoa and led to hundreds of millions of dollars in overpayments. Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, supplied the alumina from its Australian unit to a Singapore-based company controlled by Victor Dahdaleh, a Canadian citizen who lives in Britain and who, according to the lawsuit, facilitated the bribes that caused Alba to overpay for the material, starting in 1993. Alba said in the lawsuit that it was seeking damages in excess of $1 billion, including punitive damages. The suit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “The suit was filed very late last night, so we have not had an opportunity to review the allegations,” an Alcoa spokesman, Kevin Lowery, said Thursday. “That said, we are not aware of any wrongdoing by any of our employees or by the company.” Later, Mr. Lowery said that Alba, a 30-year customer of Alcoa, contacted the company two weeks ago and asked Alcoa to investigate and settle the case.

The rejection puts pressure on BHP to raise the price further. Skip to next paragraph Alex Mita/Agence France Presse  Getty Images Marius Kloppers, the chief of BHP, spoke by video Wednesday. Alex Vanselow, the finance chief, listened in the foreground. “BHP Billiton’s offers, while improved, still fail to recognize the underlying value of Rio Tinto’s quality assets and prospects,” Paul D. Skinner, Rio Tinto’s chairman, said in a statement. “Our plans are unchanged, and will remain so unless a proposal is made that fully reflects the value of Rio Tinto.” Marius Kloppers, BHP’s chief executive, said earlier in the day that BHP’s improved offer is “realistic, compelling and rational.” Mr. Kloppers did not exclude raising the offer, but BHP’s shares fell 4.8 percent, to £15.2 ($22.4) on the London stock exchange, indicating that some shareholders worry BHP could get involved in a costly bidding war. BHP sweetened its offer after China unexpectedly acquired a minority stake in Rio Tinto on Friday, widely interpreted as a move to block or complicate BHP’s plan to create a sprawling global resources empire with a market value close to $350 billion. The combination of BHP and Rio Tinto, based in London, would be the second-largest takeover in history, after Vodafone’s acquisition of Mannesmann in 1999. “There will have to be a higher offer,” said David Hart, senior analyst at Fat Prophets in London. “Because they didn’t say it’s a final offer, it leaves them some wiggle room.” Mr. Hart said BHP might have to raise the offer to four BHP shares for each Rio Tinto share from the current offer of 3.4 shares. China paid an equivalent of about 4.1 BHP shares for each of Rio Tinto’s London-traded shares. Beijing has objected strongly to the merger, which it fears would give BHP the upper hand in setting the prices for iron ore and other commodities that China must import to sustain its economy. BHP, under the leadership of Mr. Kloppers, earns almost 20 percent of its revenue from China. The Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chinalco, and Alcoa joined forces on Friday to take a 12 percent stake in Rio Tinto. This week, Chinalco, which contributed $12.8 billion of the $14 billion used to buy the stake, said it was content to sit on what it described as a strategic investment in Rio Tinto. Chinalco, which is controlled by the Chinese government, and Alcoa have not ruled out a competing bid, but any move appears unlikely until next week after the lunar new year holidays, which bring economic activity to a halt in much of China. “Together, we plan to closely monitor further developments, in particular any response from the board of Rio Tinto,” the two companies said Wednesday. “As shareholders in Rio Tinto P.L.C., we believe any offer should reflect the fundamental value of the company.” Some analysts have said the stake held by Chinalco could make a purchase by BHP more difficult, but in a conference call with journalists Wednesday morning in Australia, Mr. Kloppers played down the significance of the Chinese share holding in BHP’s decision to increase its bid. “It was just another factor,” he said. He also hinted that he does not think a successful rival bidder will emerge. Some mining industry experts doubt that China would be prepared to risk an investment of the size needed to top BHP’s bid. And they note that Chinalco would face even greater regulatory obstacles than BHP, particularly in Australia, where both BHP and Rio Tinto have extensive holdings, if it made a counteroffer. The Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, discussed Chinalco’s investment with Australian officials this week but distanced the Chinese government from the move. “This is a decision, independent decision, made by the two companies, one Chinese, one American,” Mr. Yang said in Canberra on Tuesday, according to a transcript of his remarks. The Chinese Communist Party has become increasingly concerned that dependence on imported energy and commodities could make China vulnerable to economic pressure at a time of international tension or conflict. It has scoured the globe in a bid to secure ownership or long-term contracts for minerals and energy to improve the security of deliveries. But as its growth drives up demand for resources, China has also become frustrated with sharp increases in prices. The relationship between BHP and China’s state-owned steel mills has become particularly tense. BHP and other suppliers are seeking a 50 percent increase in the price of iron ore shipped in 2008.

The stealth move was months in the making, but executed in one day, as the Chinese company moved to buy up shares of Rio Tinto, underscoring two fundamental realities: the strategic significance of mining in a resource-stretched age and China’s formidable and still largely untapped economic might. The $14 billion bid by Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chinalco, and Aluminum Corporation of America, Alcoa, to acquire 12 percent of Rio Tinto’s London shares set the stage for a fierce battle for control of the company. It came just days before BHP Billiton, the biggest mining company in the world, was expected to formally offer its own bid to buy all of Rio Tinto for about $130 billion. The deal announced Friday was also by far the largest overseas investment ever made by a Chinese company and the strongest indication yet that state-controlled companies here intend to be global players and to protect China’s strategic interest. China is the world’s largest producer of steel and needs iron ore, which is used in making steel. Though Chinalco has a history of making overseas acquisitions, the move seemed largely intended to block a BHP acquisition of Rio, analysts say. “The Chinese are probably the best capitalists that communism will ever have given birth to,” said Michelle Applebaum, head of an independent steel equity research firm in Chicago. “The J.V. with Alcoa was a key strategic move, in our view,” she said, referring to the joint venture and noting Alcoa’s reputation as “one of the world’s most responsible conservators of capital” and the political pull of its former chairman, former Treasury secretary Paul O’Neill. China knows the power of politics. Three years ago, the state-owned Chinese oil giant CNOOC sought but failed to acquire the Unocal Corporation, the American oil company, for about $20 billion, after opposition arose in the United States Now, China appears to be making another bold play to capture the natural resources it needs to fuel its fast-growing economy. In recent years, it has made aggressive forays into other parts of the world, including Africa, seeking to acquire oil and other increasingly scarce natural resources at a time when commodity prices are soaring. Last year, China’s state-controlled sovereign wealth fund  another increasingly visible and controversial measure of the new wealth of the nation  invested in the private equity firm Blackstone. Later, it paid about $5 billion to buy a small stake in Morgan Stanley. The Rio bid, however, appears to be largely defensive. Analysts say Beijing officials are worried that if BHP and Rio merge, the new entity, which would control 60 percent of iron ore production, would be able to dictate the prices of commodities vital to China’s growth. A merger of BHP and Rio Tinto would be one of the largest in history, creating a global mining giant with a market value close to $350 billion. BHP executives argue that a merger with Rio Tinto would allow the two companies to expand output more rapidly and reduce costs for major customers while reaping fatter profits. Chinalco and Alcoa said they had formed a special corporation based in Singapore called Shining Prospect to acquire the Rio stock Friday. Most of the $14 billion came from Chinalco, which is ultimately controlled by the government in Beijing. Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh, contributed only about $1.2 billion to purchase the Rio stake. But many analysts said the Chinese are unlikely to risk exciting a political or economic reaction by taking over Rio completely. “The Chinese metals ministry has positioned itself to ultimately create a long position  but not a control position  upstream in many of its metals markets that has eluded the nation to date,” Ms. Applebaum said. "We believe that the Chinese recognize that control will likely be elusive  if not impossible  and that ownership of its raw material resources is key to the future.” Shares of most of the companies involved rose Friday in trading in New York, London, Sydney and Shanghai. Shares of Rio soared 13 percent in London. Chinalco and Alcoa said they did not intend to make a bid for all of Rio Tinto, which also has large aluminum holdings, in the coming months, but that if another suitor came along, other than BHP Billiton, they might join such a bid. The statement, analysts say, was a hint that the two could team up with other companies or entities, possibly from China, to bid for all of Rio and wage a tough takeover battle with BHP, driving up the price of Rio shares. Chinalco, which is based in Beijing, issued a statement Friday evening, saying: "Our acquisition of a significant strategic stake in Rio Tinto Friday reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects for the rapidly evolving global mining sector." An Alcoa spokesman was also circumspect. "”As of now, our intention is to make this investment and that is it," the spokesman, Kevin Lowery, said. A Rio Tinto spokeswoman in London, Faeth Birch at Finsbury, a public relations firm, said, "This reinforces our position that BHP’s proposal undervalues Rio Tinto." BHP declined to comment Friday. That a Chinese company would move so decisively into the center of a takeover attempt by BHP is not surprising. Last November and December, when BHP officials were traveling in China to talk to Chinese government officials about what impact a merger with Rio might have on Chinese purchases of iron ore, the state-controlled press was filled with rumors about a Chinese government-backed bid for Rio, possibly from the state-owned steel maker Baosteel, one of the country’s biggest consumers of iron ore. But Baosteel executives later disputed the reports, and analysts said it would be difficult for any Chinese company to bid for a company whose value could climb to well over $160 billion in a takeover battle. Few companies in the world have that kind of cash or stock value, and any Chinese company making a bid would be heavily scrutinized by investors and government authorities in London and Australia, where Rio has many of its operations, partly because of suspicions that the Chinese government could be behind the deal. Now, however, executives involved in the takeover deal have no doubt that the Chinese government is prepared to play a role in the outcome of the Rio takeover battle. Neither Chinalco nor Alcoa have the cash or stock to make a $150 billion bid, analysts say. Shares of Alcoa are worth about $30 billion and Chinalco shares in China are worth about $50 billion.

More Articles in Business »SHANGHAI  The state-owned giant Aluminum Corporation of China and the Aluminum Corporation of America stunned analysts and investors Friday by buying a minority stake in Rio Tinto, the world’s third largest mining company. The stealth move was months in the making, but executed in one day, as the Chinese company moved to buy up shares of Rio Tinto, underscoring two fundamental realities: the strategic significance of mining in a resource-stretched age and China’s formidable and still largely untapped economic might. The $14 billion bid by Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chinalco, and Aluminum Corporation of America, Alcoa, to acquire 12 percent of Rio Tinto’s London shares set the stage for a fierce battle for control of the company. It came just days before BHP Billiton, the biggest mining company in the world, was expected to formally offer its own bid to buy all of Rio Tinto for about $130 billion. The deal announced Friday was also by far the largest overseas investment ever made by a Chinese company and the strongest indication yet that state-controlled companies here intend to be global players and to protect China’s strategic interest. China is the world’s largest producer of steel and needs iron ore, which is used in making steel. Though Chinalco has a history of making overseas acquisitions, the move seemed largely intended to block a BHP acquisition of Rio, analysts say. “The Chinese are probably the best capitalists that communism will ever have given birth to,” said Michelle Applebaum, head of an independent steel equity research firm in Chicago. “The J.V. with Alcoa was a key strategic move, in our view,” she said, referring to the joint venture and noting Alcoa’s reputation as “one of the world’s most responsible conservators of capital” and the political pull of its former chairman, former Treasury secretary Paul O’Neill. China knows the power of politics. Three years ago, the state-owned Chinese oil giant CNOOC sought but failed to acquire the Unocal Corporation, the American oil company, for about $20 billion, after opposition arose in the United States Now, China appears to be making another bold play to capture the natural resources it needs to fuel its fast-growing economy. In recent years, it has made aggressive forays into other parts of the world, including Africa, seeking to acquire oil and other increasingly scarce natural resources at a time when commodity prices are soaring. Last year, China’s state-controlled sovereign wealth fund  another increasingly visible and controversial measure of the new wealth of the nation  invested in the private equity firm Blackstone. Later, it paid about $5 billion to buy a small stake in Morgan Stanley. The Rio bid, however, appears to be largely defensive. Analysts say Beijing officials are worried that if BHP and Rio merge, the new entity, which would control 60 percent of iron ore production, would be able to dictate the prices of commodities vital to China’s growth. A merger of BHP and Rio Tinto would be one of the largest in history, creating a global mining giant with a market value close to $350 billion. BHP executives argue that a merger with Rio Tinto would allow the two companies to expand output more rapidly and reduce costs for major customers while reaping fatter profits. Chinalco and Alcoa said they had formed a special corporation based in Singapore called Shining Prospect to acquire the Rio stock Friday. Most of the $14 billion came from Chinalco, which is ultimately controlled by the government in Beijing. Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh, contributed only about $1.2 billion to purchase the Rio stake. But many analysts said the Chinese are unlikely to risk exciting a political or economic reaction by taking over Rio completely. “The Chinese metals ministry has positioned itself to ultimately create a long position  but not a control position  upstream in many of its metals markets that has eluded the nation to date,” Ms. Applebaum said. "We believe that the Chinese recognize that control will likely be elusive  if not impossible  and that ownership of its raw material resources is key to the future.” Shares of most of the companies involved rose Friday in trading in New York, London, Sydney and Shanghai. Shares of Rio soared 13 percent in London. Chinalco and Alcoa said they did not intend to make a bid for all of Rio Tinto, which also has large aluminum holdings, in the coming months, but that if another suitor came along, other than BHP Billiton, they might join such a bid.

The earnings report, the first this quarter from a company in the Dow Jones industrial average, exceeded Wall Street expectations. Alcoa reported after the close of regular trading. Alcoa shares rose as much as $1.20, to $32.45, in after-hours trading. In regular trading, the shares were up 25 cents, to $31.25. The strong results, coupled with a bullish forecast from the chemical maker DuPont earlier in the day, bode well for the raw materials group heading into 2008, analysts said. “It’s kind of an early indication of the earnings trend, but more importantly, it might be a sign if the DuPont numbers hold true,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical adviser at Delta Global Advisors. “Those are the sectors that have been actually the strongest.” Alcoa said profit increased to $632 million, or 75 cents a share, from $359 million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The company received a lift of 38 cents a share from its agreement to sell its packaging and consumer business. Before items, the company earned 36 cents a share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected 34 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Alcoa said revenue dropped to $7.39 billion from $7.84 billion because of lower metal prices and the loss of revenue from its soft alloy extrusion business, which is now part of a joint venture. Alcoa said operating income for its alumina business declined in part because of higher freight and energy costs and unfavorable currency rates. On Monday, Credit Suisse cut its profit outlook for the company, citing lower aluminum prices, adverse currency and energy price changes and more pronounced weakness in some markets. Alumina Lowers Forecast SYDNEY, Australia (Reuters)  Alumina of Australia cut its 2007 forecast by 17 percent on Thursday, citing lower aluminum prices, a higher Australian dollar and increased costs.

Alcoa said in April that it was considering shedding the units, which have felt a pinch from the same rising commodities prices that have driven profits in the aluminum giant's core operations. And amid massive consolidation within the industry, some analysts have said that overseas rivals with bulging coffers may take advantage of the weaker dollar and acquire the 119-year-old company. The sale may be aimed at warding off would-be buyers. The divisions generated about $3.2 billion in revenue last year, or 10 percent of Alcoa's overall revenues. They employ about 10,000 people in 22 countries. The Rank Group is the investment vehicle of Graeme Hart, one of New Zealand's richest businessmen.

Alumina precedes aluminum. Aluminum has always been something of an outsider in the mining industry. Its unusual cost structure leads some people to call it solidified electricity. A lightweight metal, its raw material, bauxite, is neither scarce nor particularly difficult to find and extract. The recent offer of $38.1 billion for the aluminum giant Alcan by Rio Tinto, a British-Australian diversified mining company known for commodities like iron ore, may be a sign that aluminum is no longer an estranged cousin. And Alcan may not be the end of the deal making. Alcoa, which was outbid by Rio Tinto and withdrew its hostile offer for Alcan, may itself become a target. Like almost everything related to commodities, the possibility that North Americas two large aluminum producers may enter the fold of mainstream mining is largely a result of Chinas voracious appetite for metals. But the story for aluminum may not be one in which China-based producers emerge triumphant. In the short term, the boom in commodities has left diversified mining companies with an embarrassment of cash and market valuations that dwarf those of aluminum producers. The market capitalization of the Australian mining giant BHP Billiton is $197 billion, slightly more than five times Alcoas current value. If, or when, the current commodities rush wanes, aluminum may get its revenge on traditional mining. Over time, the highly concentrated aluminum industry has been much more successful at maintaining stable prices than markets for commodities like copper, currently trading at high levels. While that means that Alcan and Alcoa have missed the bonanza enjoyed by other metals producer, it also suggests that aluminum prices are unlikely to crash in a downturn.  John Meyer, the head of mining equities at Numis Securities in London, said that for diversified mining companies, aluminum offered a form of insurance. The hope is that there will be growth in the business, Mr. Meyer said, and that growth will be a little more consistent and predictable than other metals. Some in the mining industry maintain that BHP is the only company with the means to buy Alcoa, probably in the $50 billion price range, given Rio Tintos offer for Alcan. Mr. Meyer, however, said it might be possible that two other huge companies  Anglo American, the diverse South African-founded conglomerate now based in London, or Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil, which bought the Canadian nickel company Inco last year  may also have designs on Alcoa. On Monday, the Brazilian company announced plans to build an alumina refinery in the northern part of the country with Hydro, a leading Norwegian producer of aluminum. It said in a statement that it had strategic focus on bauxite and alumina. Representatives of Alcoa and BHP both declined to comment, although reports last week from Australia suggested that BHP was not interested in bidding for Alcoa. But an executive with knowledge of Alcoas strategy, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company expected to receive a buyout offer, most likely from BHP. The timing remains the unknown. Although there is no reason for BHP to be in a hurry to follow Rio Tintos lead, a prolonged delay in making a bid for Alcoa would give other would-be purchasers time to organize financing. Coming up with cash is less of an issue for BHP, which posted earnings of $12.3 billion in the last 12 months. Rio Tinto, if it acquires Alcan, and any mining company that buys Alcoa, will find themselves in some unfamiliar territory. On many levels, aluminum companies have much more in common with steel makers. Across the industry, aluminum companies have three significant costs: bauxite, the raw ore that is refined into alumina; electricity, which smelters use to turn alumina into aluminum; and capital, used mostly to build smelters. Like steel makers, but unlike most mining companies, Alcan and Alcoa also run large research and development operations to create products for customers including the automotive and aerospace industries. Even more distant from mining, the two aluminum companies manufacture and market products including packaging, truck wheels and aluminum foil. China is the one country where aluminum production is not consolidated into a small number of large companies. Alcoa, Alcan and United Company Rusal of Moscow dominate the rest of the market. But China has become a major aluminum producer and is rapidly increasing production. According to the International Aluminum Institute, 5.29 million tons of aluminum were produced in China in the first five months of the year compared with 3.86 million in the similar period of 2006. Global production in that time was over 11 million tons.  Unlike in some other industries, China has only one advantage when it comes to making aluminum: its low capital requirements. A new smelter can be built in China for about a third the cost of one in North America. Once a smelter is up and running everything changes. China relies mainly on high-cost, coal-burning power stations for its smelters electricity. Alcan, by contrast, gets about half its power from low-cost hydroelectric dams. In the current period of high prices and high demand for aluminum, Chinas power costs are not particularly problematic. But Mr. Meyer said that could quickly change if demand fell and China had surplus production. The cost of aluminum is really the cost of electricity, he said. Thats the reason why China is our friend. In hard times, Chinas power costs make it among the highest-cost producers of aluminum. That, Mr. Meyer said, would make it hard for China to sell surplus aluminum on the world market. Nor, he added, is it likely to divert inexpensive hydroelectric resources to aluminum production when its electricity systems struggle to keep up with the needs of higher-value industries, like the Chinese aerospace companies that use aluminum from Alcoa to fabricate components for Boeing 737s. In Mr. Meyers view, the Chinese are much more likely to reduce the production of aluminum and import it in a slowdown. If he is correct, hard times for industry could mean even better times for Alcan, Alcoa and anyone who acquires them today. Correction: July 26, 2007 Because of an editing error, the Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about buyouts in the aluminum industry, referred incorrectly to Alcoa. The company expects to get a buyout offer, probably from BHP; it has not already received one. More Articles in Business »Correction Appended TORONTO Skip to next paragraph Alcan South Pacific, via Associated Press An Alcan alumina refinery in the Northern Territory of Australia. Alumina precedes aluminum. Aluminum has always been something of an outsider in the mining industry. Its unusual cost structure leads some people to call it solidified electricity. A lightweight metal, its raw material, bauxite, is neither scarce nor particularly difficult to find and extract. The recent offer of $38.1 billion for the aluminum giant Alcan by Rio Tinto, a British-Australian diversified mining company known for commodities like iron ore, may be a sign that aluminum is no longer an estranged cousin. And Alcan may not be the end of the deal making. Alcoa, which was outbid by Rio Tinto and withdrew its hostile offer for Alcan, may itself become a target. Like almost everything related to commodities, the possibility that North Americas two large aluminum producers may enter the fold of mainstream mining is largely a result of Chinas voracious appetite for metals. But the story for aluminum may not be one in which China-based producers emerge triumphant. In the short term, the boom in commodities has left diversified mining companies with an embarrassment of cash and market valuations that dwarf those of aluminum producers. The market capitalization of the Australian mining giant BHP Billiton is $197 billion, slightly more than five times Alcoas current value. If, or when, the current commodities rush wanes, aluminum may get its revenge on traditional mining. Over time, the highly concentrated aluminum industry has been much more successful at maintaining stable prices than markets for commodities like copper, currently trading at high levels. While that means that Alcan and Alcoa have missed the bonanza enjoyed by other metals producer, it also suggests that aluminum prices are unlikely to crash in a downturn.  John Meyer, the head of mining equities at Numis Securities in London, said that for diversified mining companies, aluminum offered a form of insurance. The hope is that there will be growth in the business, Mr. Meyer said, and that growth will be a little more consistent and predictable than other metals. Some in the mining industry maintain that BHP is the only company with the means to buy Alcoa, probably in the $50 billion price range, given Rio Tintos offer for Alcan. Mr. Meyer, however, said it might be possible that two other huge companies  Anglo American, the diverse South African-founded conglomerate now based in London, or Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil, which bought the Canadian nickel company Inco last year  may also have designs on Alcoa. On Monday, the Brazilian company announced plans to build an alumina refinery in the northern part of the country with Hydro, a leading Norwegian producer of aluminum. It said in a statement that it had strategic focus on bauxite and alumina. Representatives of Alcoa and BHP both declined to comment, although reports last week from Australia suggested that BHP was not interested in bidding for Alcoa. But an executive with knowledge of Alcoas strategy, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company expected to receive a buyout offer, most likely from BHP. The timing remains the unknown. Although there is no reason for BHP to be in a hurry to follow Rio Tintos lead, a prolonged delay in making a bid for Alcoa would give other would-be purchasers time to organize financing. Coming up with cash is less of an issue for BHP, which posted earnings of $12.3 billion in the last 12 months. Rio Tinto, if it acquires Alcan, and any mining company that buys Alcoa, will find themselves in some unfamiliar territory. On many levels, aluminum companies have much more in common with steel makers. Across the industry, aluminum companies have three significant costs: bauxite, the raw ore that is refined into alumina; electricity, which smelters use to turn alumina into aluminum; and capital, used mostly to build smelters.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Christinne Muschi/Reuters From left, Richard Evans, Alcans chief; Thomas Albanese, chief of Rio Tinto; Yves Fortier, chairman of Alcan; Paul Skinner, chairman of Rio Tinto. While it remained to be seen if the unusually rich offer prevented a bidding war, within hours of the announcement Alcoa abandoned the bid that it started in May. The high price will not be the only impediment to rival offers. Alcan, whose board unanimously endorsed the offer, must pay Rio Tinto various fees totaling $1.24 billion if the deal fails. If successful, the offer will create the worlds largest aluminum producer and the largest miner of bauxite, the ore from which almost all aluminum is extracted. Rio Tinto will borrow $40 billion to complete the purchase but plans to reduce that debt by selling some assets, including Alcans packaging unit, which has its largest base of operations in Europe. At $101 a share, Rio Tintos all-cash offer is 32.8 percent higher than Alcoas failed bid. At this price level, we have more attractive options for delivering additional value to shareholders, Alain Belda, Alcoas chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. While a purchase of Alcan by Rio Tinto avoids many of the competition questions related to the Alcoa offer, it does not escape another issue that plagued that bid. The deal follows a series of takeovers of major Canadian resource companies, making it politically delicate. Although both Rio Tinto and Alcan executives emphasized the benefits to Canada from the deal, Alcan will vanish from Canadian stock exchanges and will be controlled by Rio Tinto, which is based in London but operated from Australia. Realistically it will enter the debate, Richard Evans, the president and chief executive of Alcan, said in an interview. This will be a case study. But at the end of the day, this is one that will be seen as positive. We believe in Canada, we have done business here for 50 years, Paul Skinner, the chairman of Rio Tinto, said at a news conference. We know how important this sector is to Quebec and Canada. Alcans business relies heavily on political good will. In both its home province of Quebec as well as British Columbia, it has received generous terms for the use of river water to produce hydroelectricity, a major cost of aluminum production. The Montreal Economic Institute, a business research organization, estimates that the water rights and other benefits from Quebec alone reduce Alcans costs by 2.7 billion Canadian dollars ($2.55 billion). Rio Tinto will combine its existing aluminum operations, which are mostly in mining, with Alcan to create a Montreal-based subsidiary, Rio Tinto Alcan. That operation will be led by Mr. Evans who will join Rio Tintos board with two other current Alcan directors. The Canadian government, which must approve the transaction under foreign investment laws, did not comment on the announcement Thursday. Rio Tinto will substantially increase its debt with the deal. The chief executive, Thomas Albanese, said the company was probably underleveraged with a debt to equity level of 5 percent. After the purchase however, that will soar to 60 percent. He said Rio Tinto will work quickly to reduce debt but declined to outline a timetable or a target. In making its bid, Rio Tinto was in a better financial position than Alcoa. While both companies have benefited from high commodity prices, Alcoa has been afflicted by increased costs, particularly for energy. Nevertheless, several credit rating agencies put Rio Tinto under review on Thursday. In a note, Moodys Investors Service said that while its review could result in a multiple notch downgrade it is not likely that Rio Tintos rating will go under A. Mr. Albanese, a mining engineer and economist who became Rio Tintos chief executive last year, will lead a changed company if the Alcan bid succeeds. Copper, which currently is its largest sector, will fall to 30 percent of Rio Tintos overall business from 40 percent. Aluminum, by contrast, will increase to 31 percent from 10 percent. If strict greenhouse gas emissions limits are introduced, owning Alcan will leave Rio Tinto well placed, at least in aluminum. Most of its power is produced with clean hydroelectricity. Rivals, particularly in the developing world, rely on coal and other fossil fuels that produce substantial amounts of greenhouse gases to generate power. Unlike Rio Tintos primary metals businesses in copper and iron ore, Alcans operations offer some protection from commodity price swings. Alcan fabricates a variety of high margin products from its aluminum, particularly for the aerospace industry. Mr. Evans confirmed that Alcan reviewed several possible alternatives to Alcoa, including making a bid for Alcoa itself. Although he declined to name the companies involved, there is widespread speculation that they included Brazils Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. Last year, CVRD acquired the Canadian nickel mining giant Inco in a protracted bidding war. Rio Tintos exceptionally high offer for Alcan may be an attempt to eliminate a repeat of the Inco battle. As for Alcoa, speculation immediately emerged that the failure of its Alcan offer has made it a takeover target. Large international mining conglomerates have made no secret that they wish to enlarge their aluminum portfolios, Scott Burns, an analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note saying the likelihood of a bid for Alcoa is slightly greater than 50 percent. More Articles in Business »MONTREAL, July 12  The mining company Rio Tinto made a sizable and friendly $38.1 billion offer for Alcan, the Canadian aluminum producer, on Thursday, easily pushing aside an earlier $27.5 billion hostile bid from Alcoa.

The unanimous vote by leaders of the union, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing 8,000 Northwest attendants, followed no-confidence resolutions against management by the pilots and mechanics unions. The airline said in an e-mailed statement that Northwest’s board had “expressed its confidence in Doug Steenland’s leadership by retaining him as president and chief executive.” Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., said June 29 it would cut flights starting in July and hire more pilots after scrapping 12 percent of its schedule in the last week of June. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) BURGER KING TO USE HEALTHIER OILS Burger King said it will use trans-fat-free cooking oil at all its United States restaurants by the end of next year, following in the footsteps of other leading fast-food restaurants. Trans fats, listed on food labels as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, can raise bad cholesterol and lower healthy cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease. Critics have said Burger King was taking too long to move toward healthier oils. The Center for Science in the Public Interest sued Burger King in May, saying it was moving too slowly and had failed to set a definite timetable for removal of trans fats.

First came the recent takeovers of the mining giant Inco, the steel maker Dofasco and the Hudson’s Bay Company, the retailer established long before Canada itself. The prospect that Alcan of Montreal might go to Alcoa of the United States and that a group including American private equity firms might acquire Bell Canada’s parent company has intensified the controversy. On Monday, in the latest sign that the takeovers had become a growing political issue, the opposition Liberal Party said that it wanted to freeze foreign takeovers of Canadian companies for three months to allow a review of investment laws. “The Conservative government should immediately review the rules governing foreign takeovers to better promote both global champions and the fair treatment of Canadian companies,” the leader of the Liberal Party, Stéphane Dion, told a news conference. The Liberals are not alone. Some prominent executives have expressed concern that Canada is losing its dominance in industries like mining. Among the critics is Ian W. Delaney, executive chairman of the mining company Sherritt International, who told The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, last week that London had replaced Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia, as his industry’s hub. Peter Munk, founder and chairman of Barrick Gold in Toronto, has warned that an exodus of head offices to other countries will cause, among other things, lower levels of charitable donations and fewer opportunities for skilled workers. Gordon Nixon, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Canada, has also raised the issue. “I sometimes worry that we may all wake up one day and find that as a nation, we have lost control of our affairs,” Dominic D’Alessandro, the president and chief executive of Manulife Financial, told shareholders on May 3. Unlike some other executives, Mr. D’Alessandro, whose company’s holdings include John Hancock in the United States, has suggested broadening the sectors covered by foreign ownership limits. Canada’s current restrictions on foreign control are largely limited to financial services, transportation, broadcasting and telecommunications companies. In 1973 the Liberals, under Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, introduced a Foreign Investment Review Act that tried to minimize foreign control of the economy. But that move was unpopular with much of the business community, and a Conservative government passed legislation in 1985 creating a review body, Investment Canada. It is believed not to have turned down a single takeover since then, although it does not publicly disclose information about decisions. John McCallum, the Liberals’ finance critic and a former chief economist of the Royal Bank, said Canadian companies should have the same protection from takeovers that other governments provide their corporations. He noted that if Alcan tries a reverse takeover of Alcoa, a step the Canadian company has said it might take, it will encounter laws in Alcoa’s home state of Pennsylvania intended to block takeovers. Speaking at a news conference in Toronto, Jim Flaherty, the Conservative government’s finance minister, rejected Mr. Dion’s proposal. “Well, I wonder what they’d say to Canadian companies that are acquiring businesses abroad,” Mr. Flaherty said. “Would we have a three-month moratorium on Canadian companies like Thomson Corporation acquiring companies like Reuters in a transaction worth more than $17 billion in the United Kingdom?” More Articles in Business »OTTAWA, May 28  A recent series of acquisitions of Canadian corporations has prompted a growing public debate over foreign control.

The Tracinda Corporation of Kirk Kerkorian sought to buy two Las Vegas properties for an estimated $12 billion, and Coca-Cola moved to broaden its noncarbonated beverage portfolio with a $4.1 billion deal. Alcan, the Canadian aluminum producer, rebuffed a $27.4 billion hostile bid from Alcoa this week. But Alcan's position that the offer is inadequate and may run into antitrust problems was not unexpected. Two years of secret negotiations between the companies collapsed late last year. Alcan said it was talking to other potential merger partners, which it did not identify, and suggested that it might make a reverse takeover bid for Alcoa. If it does, the State of Pennsylvania, where Alcoa has its headquarters, may be a problem. After the state lost several head offices to takeovers in the 1980s, it approved new laws that allow companies to include the interests of communities and employees when reviewing bids. It also gives target companies other defensive measures. By considering interests other than those of its shareholders, Alcoa, legally at least, may be able to fend off any reverse bid from its Canadian rival.

Alcan said that it was in talks with other companies and added that it was considering the possibility of turning the tables with a counterbid for Alcoa. Skip to next paragraph Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press, via Associated Press Richard B. Evans is president and chief executive of Alcan. Related Alcan Press Release (micro.newswire.ca) Alcan said in a statement that its directors had unanimously concluded that the bid by Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh, did not reflect the Canadian company’s full value or offer its shares a sufficient premium. Yves Fortier, Alcan’s chairman, said that “the company is evaluating all options in the interest of shareholder value.” When asked during an interview whether those options included Alcan reversing the situation through a hostile bid for Alcoa, Richard B. Evans, the president and chief executive, replied: “All means ‘all.’ ” In a statement, Alcoa said it was “reviewing Alcan’s response and will provide a more in-depth response after we have had time to examine it further.” Mr. Evans declined to name which other companies were in negotiations with Alcan. But the mining companies BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce have all been named as potential buyers, as have several aluminum producers in Russia and China. While the idea of a counteroffer by Alcan for Alcoa  often called a Pac-Man bid, after the video game in which characters try to gobble up opponents before being eaten themselves  has been floated by analysts, most expect that Alcoa will simply enrich its offer. Not all analysts, however, view Alcan’s rejection as a ploy to bolster its takeover value. Carol Levenson, a debt analyst with Gimme Credit in New York, wrote in a note to debt holders after Tuesday’s announcement that while another offer for Alcan was possible “we think the company is more likely to attempt to remain independent.” Alcan and Alcoa held secret talks for almost two years before negotiations broke down late last year. “Despite two years of approaches by Alcoa,” Mr. Evans said in the Alcan statement, “at no time was Alcan presented a compelling proposal  either in terms of economics, structure or conditionality  that was in the best interests of our shareholders.” Mr. Evans said that although Alcoa’s chief executive, Alain J. P. Belda, told him last year that a hostile bid was his company’s “fallback position,” he was nevertheless “somewhat surprised” when Alcoa took that step on May 7. “We felt it would be somewhat risky for them,” Mr. Evans said. “Based on everything we had seen, it would be very difficult for them to execute.” The hostile offer, Mr. Evans said, did not vary substantially from the friendly proposal that Alcoa had made earlier. It was also, he added, no more appealing to Alcan. Alcoa’s current bid, according to regulatory filings, includes $22 a share in cash and 0.9418 of an Alcoa common share for each Alcan share. “There are certain elements of the combination that do make industrial sense, as there would be with other companies,” he said. One of Alcan’s concerns, Mr. Evans said, was the possibility that any merger would have a difficult time with antitrust regulators in Canada, the United States and Europe. Combined, the two companies would have about $54 billion in sales in 2006 figures and would have produced 7.8 million metric tons of aluminum. While Alcoa has identified some assets it would shed, most in aerospace products, Mr. Evans contended that the company did not have a clear plan for dealing with antitrust issues. “Any list that might be floated out for this asset or any asset is just a starting point,” he said. Mr. Evans added that even though Alcan had a “clear solution” for competition issues surrounding its 2003 acquisition of the French aluminum producer Pichiney, approval still required months of talks. Another sticking point is headquarters locations of a merged company. Alcan is prominent in Canada and its home province of Quebec. As a result, Mr. Evans said that it insisted that Montreal act as the head office of a merged operation. Alcoa continues to propose that Montreal act as a joint head office with New York, where it has its executive offices. Alcan, which is slightly smaller than Alcoa, will probably encounter difficulties with the state of Pennsylvania if it attempts a reverse takeover. Alcoa did not opt out of a series of anti-takeover laws that were adopted by the state in 1990 to stem the loss of head offices from its cities. Because Alcoa is not based in Canada, its bid for Alcan must be approved by the Canadian government. While Investment Canada, the agency responsible for such reviews, does not publicly discuss its decisions, it is thought to have never turned down a merger. While word of the secret talks emerged only after Alcoa’s bid, Mr. Evans said that the much stronger share price performance of Alcan compared with Alcoa over the last five years was an endorsement of his company’s decision not to merge. From May 1999, when Mr. Belda became Alcoa’s chief executive, to last February, when takeover speculation lifted share prices, Alcoa’s stock rose by 3 percent. Alcan shares increased 48 percent.

LINGUA FRANCA<date>Published: May 13, 2007</date><text>When Alain J. P. Belda, chief executive of the aluminum producer Alcoa, tapes video messages for his company's employees, he often does five takes. But that is not the result of any shortcomings before the camera. Mr. Belda, who was born in Morocco but raised mainly in Brazil and Canada, is proficient in five languages: English, Portuguese, French, Spanish and Italian. Conveniently, Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, has operations in countries where those languages are spoken. Mr. Belda spent five years working in Quebec, and his abilities in French were particularly useful last week when he was in Montreal to announce a $27 billion hostile bid for Alcan, a rival based in that city. He could not have expected a warm welcome, given that Quebec's premier, Jean Charest, recently described Alcan's relationship to the city as ''a great love story that has gone on for more than 100 years.'' Many Canadian companies have moved their headquarters out of Quebec or downsized operations there. Alcan, however, recently announced plans to expand its headquarters in Montreal. But Mr. Belda's Quebec connection, and his ability to field questions in either of Canada's official languages at a news conference, may have softened concerns about one of Montreal's largest corporations falling under American control. Even if it didn't, it was a performance that could not be matched by Alcan's chairman, Richard B. Evans. While Mr. Evans, a native of Oregon, is a prominent booster of Montreal, he does not speak French. However, an Alcan spokeswoman, Anik Michaud, said Mr. Evans understands the language well enough that it is unwise to say anything in French in front of him that a speaker would rather he not hear.

But, because of potential antitrust issues, few anticipated that Alcoa of Pittsburgh would be the likely buyer. But on Monday, Alcoa surprised the industry with a hostile bid for Alcan valued at $27 billion. Perhaps even more surprising was the news that the two companies had negotiated a friendly merger for about two years without the talks leaking out. Alcoa's biggest hurdle may prove to be the province of Quebec. Alcan has arrangements with the province that allow it to produce or buy power at discount rates. The catch is that the arrangements require Alcan's headquarters to be in Montreal, something that will no longer be the case under Alcoa's ownership.

The Dow Jones industrial average passed 13,300. The move by Alcoa, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow index, gave much of the market a lift because investors often regard merger-and-acquisition activity as a bullish bet by companies on future profit. The Dow rose 48.35 points, or 0.36 percent, to 13,312.97. It has gained in 24 of the last 27 sessions. Broader market indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index moved up 3.86 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,509.48, a bit closer to its record high of 1,527.46 in March 2000. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.20 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,570.95. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies slipped 1.01 points, or 0.12 percent, to 831.87. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 1.32 billion shares. Crude oil for June delivery fell 46 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $61.47 a barrel. Investors had little earnings data to go on as they tried to determine if Wall Streets gains would continue. They are also awaiting the Federal Reserves decision tomorrow on interest rates.

The Dow Jones industrial average passed 13,300. The move by Alcoa, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow index, gave much of the market a lift because investors often regard merger-and-acquisition activity as a bullish bet by companies on future profit. The Dow rose 48.35 points, or 0.36 percent, to 13,312.97. It has gained in 24 of the last 27 sessions. Broader market indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index moved up 3.86 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,509.48, a bit closer to its record high of 1,527.46 in March 2000. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.20 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,570.95. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies slipped 1.01 points, or 0.12 percent, to 831.87.

Skip to next paragraph Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press Alain Belda, chief executive of Alcoa, said his company decided to proceed with a hostile bid to protect itself from Russian and Chinese rivals. Announcement of the offer, which would restore Alcoas status as the worlds largest aluminum business, came Monday after attempts by the two companies to negotiate a friendly merger over the last two years. The deal would probably draw intense antitrust scrutiny. A larger issue in the short term is that the prospect of Alcans coming under foreign control is politically sensitive in Canada, particularly in Alcans home province, Quebec. Politics will be quite critical, said Karl Moore, an associate professor at the Faculty of Management at McGill University in Montreal. Quebec politics may mean there is some poison in swallowing Alcan. Shares of Alcan, which is based in Montreal, rose 34 percent Monday, or 23.02 Canadian dollars (about $20.79), to 90.57 Canadian dollars. Its shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange soared $21.08, to $82.11. At a news conference in a hotel down the street from Alcans aluminum-clad headquarters, Alcoas chairman and chief executive, Alain J. P. Belda, said his company decided to proceed with a hostile offer to protect itself from Russian and Chinese rivals. Bigger is better in this business, Mr. Belda said. As my father used to say:  You have to be bigger than the hole you can fall in.  Mr. Belda declined to say what led to the collapse of the earlier merger negotiations in November. He estimated the pretax savings from combining the companies at $1 billion a year. In a brief statement, Alcan said that its directors would review the offer. Combined, the two companies would have had about $54 billion in sales in 2006 and would have produced 7.8 million metric tons of aluminum. In March, the Russian aluminum producers United Company Rusal and Russian Aluminum joined to become the worlds largest aluminum producer. In recent interviews, Alcans president and chief executive, Richard B. Evans, dismissed the need for his company to grow larger through a merger. He also warned that any hostile takeover of Alcan might endanger the companys agreements with Quebec, which provides it discount rates for electricity, a major cost of producing aluminum. The specific terms of those arrangements are confidential, making it difficult to judge their potential impact, but the government has indicated they require Alcan to maintain its headquarters in Montreal. Sensitive to those concerns, Mr. Belda arrived in Quebec on Saturday to brief provincial politicians, including Premier Jean Charest. Mr. Belda, who was born in Brazil, spent most of his teenage years in Quebec. Unusual for the chief executive of American company, he easily slipped between English and French during Mondays news conference. Alcoa is promising that if it acquires Alcan, it will move some of its head office functions to Montreal and make the city the headquarters for its primary materials unit as well as its research and development operations. The merger news comes at a difficult time for Mr. Charest. A recent election left his government without a majority in Quebecs legislature where he faces two opposition parties with nationalist leanings. As well, many in Quebec believe that even though the Molson Coors Brewing Company maintained headquarters in Denver and Montreal after a 2005 merger, that brewer is now run from the United States. Mr. Charests government did not comment on Mondays announcement. The federal cabinet minister responsible for Montreal, Michael M. Fortier, however, stopped short of endorsing the deal, despite his Conservative Partys general inclination to leave businesses alone. Mr. Fortier told reporters Alcoa pledged to maintain jobs in Canada before adding: Well, well have to see. As a foreign takeover, the bid will also require federal approval. Alcoa itself has substantial operations in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada that in some cases include special cheap electricity deals with governments. Even if another bidder comes forward for Alcan, that relationship should give Alcoa a considerable advantage, Professor Moore said. Professor Moore is skeptical that Alcoa can save $1 billion a year without reducing employment in Canada. Any prospect of job cuts will only inflame the political issues surrounding the deal, he said. The bid offers Alcan shareholders $58.60 a share in cash plus 0.4108 of an Alcoa share, representing a 20 percent premium over Fridays closing price. In a note to investors, an analyst at Morningstar, Scott Burns, said the current offer exceeds his estimate of Alcans stand-alone value, adding with $1 billion of synergies planned, we think that Alcoa has left itself room to further raise its bid before it begins to destroy value. Alcan will be returning to its parent if the takeover is completed. The Canadian company was founded in 1902 by the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, Alcoas predecessor. While Alcan was spun off as a separate company in 1928, the two companies maintained cross ownership until the arrangement was ended by court order in 1951. Alcoa noted in a statement that some operations of the merged company would have to be sold to satisfy antitrust concerns in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe and the United States. Correction: May 9, 2007 An article in Business Day yesterday about Alcoa’s $27 billion offer for the rival Alcan included incorrect information from Alcoa about the country of birth for Alcoa’s chairman and chief executive, Alain J.

One of the first issues that the group, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, plans to address is how American factory owners and workers have been hurt by what the group says is the Chinese governments improper currency manipulation and industry subsidies. The United States has lost one-sixth of its factory jobs over the last six years because of many factors, including automation, imports and relocation overseas in search of lower-cost labor and proximity to developing markets. The hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs is hurting America down to the local level, said Terrence D. Straub, United States Steels senior vice president for public policy and government affairs. Until and unless there is a political understanding of that  and political attention paid to that  our fear is much wont change and in 10 years the American manufacturing base could be gone. The alliance, which plans to announce its formation today in newspaper and online advertisements, asserts that the decline of manufacturing undercuts Americas long-term competitiveness, its research capabilities and its ability to produce sophisticated weapons needed for national security. The alliance aims to be partly a policy research organization, tackling subjects like international trade practices and what alliance officials say is inadequate enforcement of trading regulations by the American government. The group also plans to focus on health policy because of concerns that high health costs have hurt American competitiveness. Another focus will be energy policy; for example, the group may examine ways to produce renewable energy in a way that creates manufacturing jobs. The image of manufacturing has taken a beating  quite unfairly  especially with the younger generation that views information technology and services as being hip and cool, said Scott Paul, the alliances executive director, who used to work in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.s industrial department. He said the group wants to reconnect the American people with the importance of manufacturing and what it means in their lives and what it has meant in terms of creating good, middle-class jobs. The alliance is financed through labor contract provisions requiring the companies to contribute to public education and policy efforts. The alliances other members are Allegheny Technologies, Mittal Steel and AK Steel, and participants say they hope other companies and unions will either join the alliance or cooperate with it. Leo W. Gerard, the president of United Steelworkers, which is based in Pittsburgh, said his union pushed to create the alliance because it believed that the National Association of Manufacturers had not been forceful enough in seeking to preserve American manufacturing jobs. The fundamental reason weve formed this is weve lost three million manufacturing jobs, and there doesnt appear to be a strong pro-American manufacturing voice out there, said Mr. Gerard, whose union represents 800,000 steel, aluminum, rubber, paper and chemical workers. The so-called manufacturers organizations that exist are part of the problem. The National Association of Manufacturers promotes the loss of manufacturing. The N.A.M. has become the voice of multinationals giving away our jobs, of setting up operations overseas. Mr. Gerard asserted that the National Association of Manufacturers had not been forceful enough in challenging Chinas trade violations because many members of the association had operations in China and did not want to anger Chinas government. Patrick J. Cleary, a senior vice president with the National Association of Manufacturers, welcomed the formation of the alliance, but he took issue with claims that his group was not doing enough to promote and protect American manufacturing. Our mission statement is, were here to promote manufacturing in America and were here to create a climate in America where manufacturing can not only survive, but can prosper, Mr. Cleary said, adding: We take a back seat to no one on fighting the battle on Chinese currency. We started it, we led it and we put it on the administrations radar screen. Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based policy research organization that has long promoted American industry, said of the new alliance, In a way, you can look at this as the last stand of American manufacturing. Mr. Prestowitz, who is not working with the alliance, said the group was an outgrowth of tensions within the National Association of Manufacturers. Theres a civil war going on within the American manufacturing establishment, he said. Its a divide between companies that are global manufacturers and companies that are mainly U.S. manufacturers. These companies have clashed over such issues as how vigorously Washington should challenge Chinas trade practices and whether promotion of free-trade agreements helps financial companies at the expense of its manufacturers.

Separately, the company said that it would also explore strategic alternatives for its electrical and electronic solutions unit and its automotive castings business. Were going to look at all options available, said Kevin Lowery, an Alcoa spokesman.

Net income rose 8.9 percent, to $662 million, or 75 cents a share, from $608 million, or 69 cents, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 11 percent, to $7.91 billion. The company, which has its headquarters in New York, is the first on the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings this quarter. Aluminum prices rose 15 percent in the quarter and have more than doubled in the last five years. Citigroup says global demand may exceed supply this year. The market environment is fundamentally very good, Charles A. Bradford, an analyst at Soleil Securities in New York, said before the earnings were released. Aerospace executives are pleading with the aluminum companies to boost output, and world economies, especially China, are doing well. Excluding revamping costs and a loss of 2 cents a share from discontinued businesses, profit was 79 cents a share. That beat the 78-cent estimate of analysts. The company sold metal at $2,902 a metric ton, on average, in the quarter, compared with $2,534 a ton a year earlier. Metal production rose to 899,000 tons, from 867,000 tons, while shipments rose to 518,000 tons, from 488,000 tons. Total aluminum product shipments rose 1 percent, to 1.37 million tons. Shares of Alcoa were the best performers on the Dow during the quarter, rising 13 percent. Part of the rally reflected speculation that the company would be a takeover target. Alcoa, which rose 3 cents, to $34.90, in regular trading, gained as much as 85 cents in after-hours trading. The earnings were released after the market closed.

Net income rose 8.9 percent, to $662 million, or 75 cents a share, from $608 million, or 69 cents, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 11 percent, to $7.91 billion. The company, which has its headquarters in New York, is the first on the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings this quarter. Aluminum prices rose 15 percent in the quarter and have more than doubled in the last five years. Citigroup says global demand may exceed supply this year. The market environment is fundamentally very good, Charles A. Bradford, an analyst at Soleil Securities in New York, said before the earnings were released. Aerospace executives are pleading with the aluminum companies to boost output, and world economies, especially China, are doing well. Excluding revamping costs and a loss of 2 cents a share from discontinued businesses, profit was 79 cents a share. That beat the 78-cent estimate of analysts. The company sold metal at $2,902 a metric ton, on average, in the quarter, compared with $2,534 a ton a year earlier. Metal production rose to 899,000 tons, from 867,000 tons, while shipments rose to 518,000 tons, from 488,000 tons. Total aluminum product shipments rose 1 percent, to 1.37 million tons. Shares of Alcoa were the best performers on the Dow during the quarter, rising 13 percent. Part of the rally reflected speculation that the company would be a takeover target. Alcoa, which rose 3 cents, to $34.90, in regular trading, gained as much as 85 cents in after-hours trading. The earnings were released after the market closed.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEFDC1731F937A35750C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=alcoainc">OPENERS: SUITS; On the Way Out But Feeling O.K.<date>Published: March 4, 2007</date><text>What's one year and 335 days between brothers? At Alcoa, where Ricardo E. Belda was a senior executive until last fall, it is nothing. Mr. Belda, the younger brother of the chairman and chief executive, Alain J. P. Belda, retired after 38 years and one month, but was given credit for an even 40 years, Alcoa's 2007 proxy statement shows. That gift of time maximized his retirement benefits, increasing the value of his pension by $284,700, the company said. That was in addition to an unidentified ''retirement gift'' that the company valued at $2,200. On his way out, he collected an initial pension payout of $141,180, an additional $166,667 ''salary continuation payment'' and $50,000 for signing a waiver and release. Since the elder brother does not serve on the compensation committee, he didn't have to vote for -- or against -- his brother.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Map Enlarge This Image Dean C. K. Cox for The New York Times Wild reindeer grazed recently near a road leading to the Karahnjukar Hydropower Project in eastern Iceland. But tucked into Icelands central highlands, where the Karahnjukar mountain meets two powerful rivers flowing north from Europes largest glacier, a nearly completed jigsaw of dams, tunnels and reservoirs has begun to reshape the wilderness. This is the $3 billion Karahnjukar Hydropower Project, a sprawling enterprise to harness the rivers for electricity that will be used for a single purpose: to fuel a new aluminum smelter owned by Alcoa, the worlds largest aluminum company. It has been the focus of the angriest and most divisive battle in recent Icelandic history. The culmination of years of effort by the center-right government to increase international investment in Iceland, the project has already begun to revitalize Icelands underpopulated east. But it has also mobilized an angry and growing coalition of people who feel that the authorities have sacrificed Icelands most precious asset  the pristine land itself  to heavy industry from abroad. Now, with proposals on the table for three more power-plant-and-aluminum-smelter projects, environmentalists say the chance to protect Icelands spectacular, and spectacularly fragile, natural beauty is running out. If all of these projects get through, then its a total environmental apocalypse for the Icelandic highlands; theyll have developed every single major glacial river and geothermal field for heavy industry, said Olafur Pall Sigurdsson, one of the organizers of Saving Iceland, a coalition of groups opposing further development. It is a very rare nature that we are the guardians of, and we are squandering it, he said. The basic issue of how to balance development and nature is the same here as in environmental fights everywhere. But the details are always slightly askew in Iceland, which sits temperamentally as well as geographically on its own, floating between Europe and America. One of the most unspoiled places in the developed world, Iceland is slightly larger than Indiana, with a population of about 300,000 people (Indianas is 6.3 million). Two-thirds live in the capital, Reykjavik; the rest are spread across 39,800 square miles of volcanic rock, treeless tundra and scrubby plains. Seventy percent of the land is uninhabitable. Icelanders tend to view their unpredictable environment  carved from volcanoes and ice and full of stunning waterfalls, geysers, fjords and glaciers  with respect and awe. The air is so pure that the Kyoto Protocol gave Iceland the right to increase its greenhouse emissions by 10 percent from 1990 levels. The pending proposals call for four more dams, as many as eight new geothermal and hydroelectric power plants, two new smelters (one owned by Alcoa) and the expansion of capacity at an existing smelter. If all are built, foreign companies would have the capacity to produce as much as 1.6 million tons of aluminum in Iceland a year. They are also allowed to pollute: another Kyoto exception gave power-intensive industries that use renewable energy in Iceland the right to emit an extra 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year until 2012. As a whole, the new smelters would require about eight times the amount of electricity currently used for all of Icelands domestic consumption, putting a huge strain on the countrys rivers and thermal fields, said Hjorleifur Guttormsson, who was Icelands energy and industry minister from 1980 to 1985. Mr. Guttormsson, a naturalist, said pollution was another concern: aluminum plants are heavy emitters of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride and other chemicals. But Alcoa says it has fitted state-of-the-art pollution controls in its new plant and has already fulfilled its companywide pledge to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent from their 1990 level. A spokesman for the company, Kevin Lowery, said the new smelter would produce 1.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide for every metric ton of aluminum it produced  a total of 541,000 metric tons a year  compared with 13 metric tons of carbon dioxide per metric ton of aluminum for a coal-fired smelter. The emissions from this facility will be less than for any other facility of this size elsewhere in the world, he said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in International »NORTH OF VATNAJOKULL GLACIER, Iceland  In the depths of winter there is almost nothing to see here but snow and rock: snow across the uneven, unearthly landscape, snow on the mist-shrouded mountains, snow stretching to what looks like the edge of the world.

The frothy mergers-and-acquisition market bubbled along, with bids, battles and, well, one bomb. TOUCH AND GO The American economy seems to have made a so-called soft landing after the housing market peaked last year, and appears to be taking off again, the latest economic data suggested. A tight labor market is pushing up many workers wages, consumers are spending more at shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country. A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month, and the Consumer Price Index, the nations best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months  on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. The numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when it meets at the end of this month, and may actually have to raise rates later in the year. ROLLING BACK BREAKS House Democrats passed legislation to rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for domestic oil producers and use the money for alternative energy and conservation technologies. The bill would rescind $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies that Congress passed in 2004 and 2005 and add $6.3 billion in royalties from companies that pump oil and gas in publicly owned waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska. It would also correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that will let oil companies avoid paying billions of dollars in royalties over the next decade. Senate leaders say they have the votes to send the bill to President Bush. The president opposes the measure, but is not expected to veto it. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa and seven other major companies joined with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. Members of the group  which also includes the utilities Duke Energy in North Carolina, PG&amp;E in California, the FPL Group in Florida and PNM Resources in New Mexico  have expressed concern that the absence of a national policy could lead to a scattershot system of state-by-state regulation or to even harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels. Earlier, a coalition of 16 business, medical and consumer groups  including AARP, the American Medical Association, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States  proposed to extend health coverage to people now uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. The environmental groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, a day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address. BURST OF BUYING General Electric announced a pair of big acquisitions, agreeing to pay $8.13 billion for two Abbott Laboratories diagnostics units and $4.8 billion for Smiths Aerospace, an aviation electronics maker in London. Including its offer earlier in the month to buy Vetco Gray, an oil and gas drilling services company in Houston, G.E. has committed itself to almost $15 billion worth of takeovers in January alone. The New York Times reported on Jan. 9 that G.E. was in talks to sell its plastics unit, a slow-growing business that could nonetheless sell for as much as $10 billion. Additional deals may have to wait for a decision on the plastics business because G.E.s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said last month that G.E. had $7 billion in cash on hand for industrial acquisitions this year. JUST SAY NO In a rare example of a board denying a request by a controlling shareholder, the directors of Cablevision Systems rejected an $8.9 billion buyout offer from its founding family, the Dolans. The board said in a letter to the family that the offer does not represent fair value for the companys public shareholders nor does it contemplate a transaction that is in their best interest. Cablevision remains publicly owned, but the Dolans, who own 20 percent of its equity but control 70 percent of its votes, have said they will not sell the company to anyone besides themselves. TRIBUNE BIDS Two firm bidders stepped up with offers to buy the Tribune Company, a media company with television stations and newspapers in the nations biggest media markets, but neither offered much of a premium over the companys flagging stock price. One bid came from Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, two billionaires in Los Angeles, where the Tribune Company owns The Los Angeles Times and KTTV. The other came from the Chandler family, which sold the Los Angeles paper and several others to Tribune in 2000. A private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, offered to buy only the TV stations. Tribune directors will review the situation this weekend and may ask for new bids. RAISING THE STAKES Express Scripts began a $24.8 billion hostile takeover attempt for a rival pharmacy benefits manager, Caremark Rx, prompting a competing bidder, the CVS Corporation, to raise its offer. Caremark rebuffed Express Scripts in favor of CVSs lower offer. Some shareholders sued Caremarks board, saying the directors put their financial interests ahead of shareholder interests. CVS, the drugstore chain, said it intended to conclude the takeover by April. STIFF SENTENCE A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., sentenced Walter A.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic A New Alliance in the Climate Debate Related The Pew Center on Global Climate Change World Resources Institute Environmental Defense Natural Resources Defense Council Introduction of this group, which includes industry giants like General Electric, DuPont and Alcoa, is aimed at adding to the recent impetus for Congressional action on emissions controls and the creation of a market in which allowances to emit carbon dioxide could be traded in a way that achieves the greatest reduction at the lowest cost. The diversity of the coalition  some members had already come out for other forms of emissions control, like a carbon tax or voluntary controls, but others had been silent on climate-change issues until now  could send a strong signal that businesses want to get ahead of the increasing political momentum for federal emissions controls, in part to ensure that their long-term interests are protected. Many energy producers and manufacturers have expressed concern that various state efforts, if not coordinated, could lead to a scattershot system of regulation. Others worry that harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels, the biggest contributor to global-warming gases, could be imposed if they do not reach a consensus on a legislative approach. The groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, the day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address and offer the administrations newest basket of proposals to promote energy security and combat global warming. Aside from General Electric and Alcoa, Caterpillar is the leading manufacturing company among the group, which also includes four utilities  Duke Energy, based in North Carolina; PG&amp;E of California; the FPL Group of Florida; and PNM Resources of New Mexico. The group counts the multinational oil company BP and Lehman Brothers as members as well. Jonathan Lash, the president of the World Resources Institute, said Thursday that this signals that the differences in the interests between these sectors and within these sectors can be resolved. Peter A. Darbee, chief executive of PG&amp;E, said, My hope and expectation is that Congress, the White House and the public will look at these chief executives and note that companies with a motive to oppose emissions controls are nonetheless saying, Heres a serious problem; it needs to be dealt with, and it needs to be dealt with now. The negotiations, conducted primarily by the chief executives of the companies, did not produce a model piece of legislation, but rather a detailed set of principles that they suggest as a guide to any legislation. In the Senate, there are already four Democratic proposals for limiting carbon emissions and creating a market-based system, under which the government gives or sells permits to businesses, allowing them a certain level of emissions. Once established, such a system would allow better-performing companies to sell or trade unneeded credits, and all companies involved would be able to determine whether it would be more efficient for them to clean up their own emissions or buy credits from others. The groups principles include recommending a range of emissions levels  from 100 to 105 percent of current levels within five years, then down to 90 to 100 percent of current levels in 10 years, and 70 to 90 percent of current levels in 15 years. In addition, the chief executives agreed after some discussion, to strongly discourage further construction of stationary sources that cannot easily capture carbon dioxide. This comes close to a rejection of almost all new coal-fired power plants on the drawing boards, including the 11 plants recently proposed by TXU, a Texas utility. The technology that would isolate carbon dioxide emissions and bury them is still in the earliest phases of development, so this near-repudiation of existing coal technology would have a disproportionate impact on utilities that depend largely on coal, like TXU and the Southern Company. But Jeff Sterba, the chief executive of PNM Resources, whose company gets about two-thirds of its power from coal and is a member of the coalition, explained why he supports such an approach. The most important thing for us is to have a viable, diverse portfolio of resources, and coal has got to be part of that mix, he said. Today, the biggest problem coal has is uncertainty about carbon. The group, called the United States Climate Action Partnership, had its origin in conversations last spring among Mr. Lash; Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense; and Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Mr. Lash had worked with Mr. Immelt on the rollout of GEs Ecomagination program in 2005  which combined pledges of emissions reductions with a new emphasis on energy-efficient and climate-friendly technologies. Mr. Sterba and the leaders of the other environmental groups, which also includes Frances Beinecke of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Eileen Claussen of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that an efficient, flexible cap-and-trade system would stimulate the development of new technologies to cut energy use and provide renewable energy. General Electric claims significant advances in these areas already. According to Peter OToole, a company spokesman, Revenues from the sale of energy-efficient and environmentally advanced products and services hit $10 billion in 2005, up from $6.2 billion in 2004. The chief executives in the group met for the first time in July. During the meeting, Mr. Krupp said, it became clear that cap-and-trade is an element of the deal that is good for everybody. Its good for the environmental community, he said, because a hard cap guarantees the integrity of the environment and industry likes it because its so efficient. Timing also played a role in the executives thinking. As Mr. Darbee said, We have the opportunity to construct something more pragmatic and realistic while President Bush is in office. A future political climate, after 2008, he said, might produce solutions less sensitive to the needs of business. Correction: January 26, 2007 A chart in Business Day last Friday about recommendations by industry and environmental groups on how to limit greenhouse emission misstated a goal of the coalition. The group wants to cut greenhouse emissions to 20 to 40 percent of current levels by 2050, not 60 to 80 percent of current levels.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic A New Alliance in the Climate Debate Related The Pew Center on Global Climate Change World Resources Institute Environmental Defense Natural Resources Defense Council Introduction of this group, which includes industry giants like General Electric, DuPont and Alcoa, is aimed at adding to the recent impetus for Congressional action on emissions controls and the creation of a market in which allowances to emit carbon dioxide could be traded in a way that achieves the greatest reduction at the lowest cost. The diversity of the coalition  some members had already come out for other forms of emissions control, like a carbon tax or voluntary controls, but others had been silent on climate-change issues until now  could send a strong signal that businesses want to get ahead of the increasing political momentum for federal emissions controls, in part to ensure that their long-term interests are protected. Many energy producers and manufacturers have expressed concern that various state efforts, if not coordinated, could lead to a scattershot system of regulation. Others worry that harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels, the biggest contributor to global-warming gases, could be imposed if they do not reach a consensus on a legislative approach. The groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, the day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address and offer the administrations newest basket of proposals to promote energy security and combat global warming. Aside from General Electric and Alcoa, Caterpillar is the leading manufacturing company among the group, which also includes four utilities  Duke Energy, based in North Carolina; PG&amp;E of California; the FPL Group of Florida; and PNM Resources of New Mexico. The group counts the multinational oil company BP and Lehman Brothers as members as well. Jonathan Lash, the president of the World Resources Institute, said Thursday that this signals that the differences in the interests between these sectors and within these sectors can be resolved. Peter A. Darbee, chief executive of PG&amp;E, said, My hope and expectation is that Congress, the White House and the public will look at these chief executives and note that companies with a motive to oppose emissions controls are nonetheless saying, Heres a serious problem; it needs to be dealt with, and it needs to be dealt with now. The negotiations, conducted primarily by the chief executives of the companies, did not produce a model piece of legislation, but rather a detailed set of principles that they suggest as a guide to any legislation. In the Senate, there are already four Democratic proposals for limiting carbon emissions and creating a market-based system, under which the government gives or sells permits to businesses, allowing them a certain level of emissions. Once established, such a system would allow better-performing companies to sell or trade unneeded credits, and all companies involved would be able to determine whether it would be more efficient for them to clean up their own emissions or buy credits from others. The groups principles include recommending a range of emissions levels  from 100 to 105 percent of current levels within five years, then down to 90 to 100 percent of current levels in 10 years, and 70 to 90 percent of current levels in 15 years. In addition, the chief executives agreed after some discussion, to strongly discourage further construction of stationary sources that cannot easily capture carbon dioxide. This comes close to a rejection of almost all new coal-fired power plants on the drawing boards, including the 11 plants recently proposed by TXU, a Texas utility. The technology that would isolate carbon dioxide emissions and bury them is still in the earliest phases of development, so this near-repudiation of existing coal technology would have a disproportionate impact on utilities that depend largely on coal, like TXU and the Southern Company. But Jeff Sterba, the chief executive of PNM Resources, whose company gets about two-thirds of its power from coal and is a member of the coalition, explained why he supports such an approach. The most important thing for us is to have a viable, diverse portfolio of resources, and coal has got to be part of that mix, he said. Today, the biggest problem coal has is uncertainty about carbon. The group, called the United States Climate Action Partnership, had its origin in conversations last spring among Mr. Lash; Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense; and Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Mr. Lash had worked with Mr. Immelt on the rollout of GEs Ecomagination program in 2005  which combined pledges of emissions reductions with a new emphasis on energy-efficient and climate-friendly technologies. Mr. Sterba and the leaders of the other environmental groups, which also includes Frances Beinecke of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Eileen Claussen of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that an efficient, flexible cap-and-trade system would stimulate the development of new technologies to cut energy use and provide renewable energy. General Electric claims significant advances in these areas already. According to Peter OToole, a company spokesman, Revenues from the sale of energy-efficient and environmentally advanced products and services hit $10 billion in 2005, up from $6.2 billion in 2004. The chief executives in the group met for the first time in July. During the meeting, Mr. Krupp said, it became clear that cap-and-trade is an element of the deal that is good for everybody. Its good for the environmental community, he said, because a hard cap guarantees the integrity of the environment and industry likes it because its so efficient. Timing also played a role in the executives thinking. As Mr. Darbee said, We have the opportunity to construct something more pragmatic and realistic while President Bush is in office. A future political climate, after 2008, he said, might produce solutions less sensitive to the needs of business. Correction: January 26, 2007 A chart in Business Day last Friday about recommendations by industry and environmental groups on how to limit greenhouse emission misstated a goal of the coalition. The group wants to cut greenhouse emissions to 20 to 40 percent of current levels by 2050, not 60 to 80 percent of current levels.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/business/11stox.html?ref=alcoainc">Shares Gain as Investors Shrug Off Declining Oil Prices<date>Published: January 11, 2007</date><text>Investors fretted over falling oil prices, but Wall Street still managed a modest gain yesterday after upbeat news from Alcoa and Apple. The market began the session with fresh concern that oil’s decline would hurt profits in the energy sector and scare off money from sources like hedge funds that have helped push stocks higher in recent months. Adding to that sense was a profit warning from Chevron. But investors eventually turned their attention to bullish news, like US Airways Group’s raising of its bid for Delta Air Lines by 20 percent, to $10.2 billion. They were also pleased by Apple’s long-awaited announcement of plans to offer a mobile phone, as well as by a solid profit report from Alcoa. “There are good underlying economic fundamentals. The buyers are starting to get a little more courageous in coming off the sidelines,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist with A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons.

Bonds fell on the slide in oil prices and a report that the United States trade deficit narrowed in November. Both trends were seen as making a rise in interest rates more likely. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to 9917/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.68 percent, from 4.65 percent. Yesterday’s trading resembled Monday’s, in which stocks were lower for much of the session before moving higher near the close. Light crude was down $1.62, at $54.02 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have been hurt as warm temperatures have weakened demand in large parts of the United States and Europe. Oil fell further after weekly domestic inventory data from the Energy Department showed a drop of 5 million barrels of crude and an increase of 5.4 million barrels of distillates like home heating oil. The aluminum producer Alcoa, one of 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, advanced $1.71, or 6 percent, to $30.23, after reporting late Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 60 percent. Shares of Compañía Anónima Nacional Teléfonos de Venezuela, or CANTV, rebounded somewhat after a Venezuelan official said the government would compensate companies whose assets could be seized under a plan by President Hugo Chávez to nationalize CANTV as well as electrical companies and several oil projects. The company’s American depositary receipts rose $1.80, or 14.8 percent, to $14.

The company also recognized a gain related to the sale of its home exteriors business on Oct. 31. In the third quarter, Alcoas profit had almost doubled, but results fell below Wall Street forecasts because of lower aluminum prices, higher costs and weakness in the North American automotive and home building sectors. Alcoa said last October that it expected to improve primary aluminum metal production by 2 percent and that costs for alumina and power would decline.

Jim Southwood, president of Commodity Metals Management in Wexford, Pa., said, We have prices about twice the long-term historical average for aluminum, which is quite positive for producers, adding, The risk is on the demand side, where these high prices could be adversely affecting demand. On Monday, a Russian company, Rusal, and the smaller Sual Group, along with a Swiss commodity-trading firm, announced a merger that will surpass Alcoa, based on output. The new business, to be known as the United Company Rusal, is expected to produce about 4 million tons a year. Alcoa had output of 3.55 million tons last year.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/business/11stox.html?ref=alcoainc">Dow Sets Record, Barely, as Earnings Data Is Awaited<date>Published: October 11, 2006</date><text>Stocks ended slightly higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching a record close after a seesaw session, as investors proceeded cautiously before the unofficial start of the third-quarter earnings period. This market just doesnt want to go down.

The deal continues a pattern in Russia of uniting companies separated in the breakup of the Soviet Union and the subsequent privatization in the 1990s into large, new monopolies, a crucial part of the economic policy of President Vladimir V. Putin. Analysts say the mergers have been driven partly by national pride and partly by the efficiencies that large companies can create. Its a very important deal for the image of Russia. It creates a global leader, No. 1. This is good for Russia, Aleksandr S. Bulygin, the chief executive of Rusal, who will have the same post in the merged company, said in a telephone interview. Like Gazprom and the government-owned oil company Rosneft, the new merged aluminum company intends to list shares on Western stock exchanges, leveraging its size and high commodity prices to get access to international capital. Under the deal, Rusal, now Russias largest aluminum company, would merge with its smaller domestic rival, Sual, and mining assets belonging to the Swiss company, Glencore, to create a company with an estimated value of $25 billion to $30 billion. It will be controlled by Oleg V. Deripaska, owner of Rusal and one of the countrys richest men. Sual is majority-owned by Viktor Vekselberg, another wealthy Russian. Glencore was founded by Marc Rich, the American commodities trader who fled the United States to avoid facing charges of tax evasion, racketeering and fraud and was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in January 2001. Glencore is now owned by its employees. The new company intends to place shares on the London Stock Exchange in 18 months, executives said on Monday. Rusal would own 66 percent, Sual 22 percent and Glencore 12 percent. The annual revenue would be $10 billion, Mr. Bulygin said. The combined company, also to be known as Russian Aluminum, or Rusal, will produce about 4 million tons a year of aluminum for use in cans, foil and automotive parts, compared with the 3.5 million tons made by Alcoa in 2005. The deal, which company executives said should be closed by April 1, would need regulatory clearance in Russia, the European Union and possibly the United States, along with Jamaica, Ireland and other countries where bauxite mines are located, Mr. Bulygin said. Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, is a century-old company and a storied name in American business. Alcoas competitive edge has been dulled because the rising price of electricity, a major factor in the production of aluminum. Rusal has a distinct advantage. Its plants are supplied with some of the worlds cheapest electricity, produced by hydropower dams on Siberian rivers, a legacy of the Soviet Unions efforts to develop Siberia. That power is cheap because it is too far from any large city to be sold for higher prices to residential consumers. The Russian company, now the worlds third-largest by volume of production, will also leapfrog Alcan of Canada, the current No. 2. Dmitry O. Afanasiev, a partner at the Russian law firm Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasiev &amp; Partners, who was a lead negotiator on the merger, said the merger would better position the companies for an initial public offering. Separately, they would be valued comparably to developing-market aluminum companies, he said, but after the merger, the sheer size and prestige of being the worlds largest will invite value comparisons with Alcoa and Alcan. The foundation is being built for a very, very powerful company that will be the leader for many years to come, Brian Gilbertson, the chief executive of Sual, said on Monday. He will become the nonexecutive chairman of the merged company. The goal, he said, is to raise cash through a public offering for a broad international expansion plan. We have the financial resources, Mr. Gilbertson said, and may I say the ambition in the management team, to pursue global projects. The combined company would have 110,000 employees, operate in 17 countries on five continents and produce 11 million tons of alumina, the basic ingredient of aluminum, each year. Kirill S. Chuiko, a metals and mining analyst at UralSib brokerage, said that he expected the Russian government to buy a stake in the combined company within a year or two. Even now, he said, the Kremlin probably had a strong say Rusals strategic business plan, as is the case in many large Russian companies, both state-owned and nominally private. Nobody can argue that at one level or another, Mr. Chuiko said, the government isnt influencing this company. More Articles in Business »MOSCOW, Oct. 9  Two Russian companies and a Swiss commodity trader announced a merger on Monday that would form the worlds largest aluminum maker, overtaking Alcoa of the United States.

Should Alcoa drop from its No. 1 spot  which has been forecast for some time by analysts  it would be partly a reflection of wider industrial shifts that now favor Russias commodity-driven economy, which benefits from cheap domestic energy prices. A merger would give Russia a second corporation that is the worlds largest in its industry. Gazprom, the Russian natural gas producer, is the worlds largest in that field. For Russia, corporate size has become a symbol of pride, in stark contrast to most of the 1990s, when Russian businesses were flat on their backs from the chaos during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Under the deal, Rusal, now Russias largest aluminum operator, would merge with its smaller domestic competitor, Sual, along with the Swiss commodity trader Glencore International, which was founded by Marc Rich, the financier who fled the United States to avoid facing charges of tax evasion, racketeering and fraud and was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in January 2001. If it goes through, the deal would be a boon for Rusal and its owner, the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska, a former nuclear physicist turned corporate raider and one of the countrys richest men. Any monopoly creates the potential of price setting, dominating the market, and competing for resources around the world, said Konstantin Remchukov, a former senior vice president at Sibirsky Aluminum, which was a precursor to the company that became Rusal. The president of any company wants to be No. 1 in the world, he said in a telephone interview. Then, they are listened to. Its important for our reputation and makes a lot of business sense. The company owners have been in backroom talks for about a month but signed a memorandum of understanding laying out the shape of the potential new company last week, according to a banker who is advising on the merger. Rusal, Sual and Glencore have not publicly announced the merger negotiations. A banker advising on the deal and company officials, who refused to speak for attribution because of continuing discussions, confirmed the talks on Wednesday. Russias Kommersant newspaper reported the negotiations earlier this month and The Financial Times reported this week that the memorandum had been signed. In the merger talks, the London office of Morgan Stanley is advising Rusal, while J. P. Morgan-Cazenove and UBS are advising Sual. Glencore does not have an adviser, according to the banker. Under the deal, Rusal would use its stock to buy Sual and the aluminum assets of Glencore. Mr. Deripaska would own 64.5 percent of the resulting company through his holding company, Basic Element. Sual, one of the properties in the empire of the Russian tycoon Viktor Vekselberg, would own 21.5 percent, and Glencore 14 percent, according to the banker, who is a managing partner at his firm. Glencore would contribute only its aluminum trading business and stakes in bauxite mines. Glencores other commodity trading business would remain privately held. An initial share float is planned within three years, according to the banker advising on the deal. The company would have a capitalization conservatively estimated at $30 billion, he said. The merger would be a marriage of cheap production in Russia with bauxite mines abroad. Glencore owns mines in Ireland and Jamaica. Rusal now controls smelters but is short on bauxite, the raw ingredient of aluminum, in spite of a recent global buying spree. The other two companies have the opposite problem, with more bauxite than they can smelt. The merged company would blend the two strengths, according to the company official. In a possible hint to the direction the Russians would steer the new company, a former chief executive of the global mining giant BHP Billiton is set to become chairman of the board. Mr. Gilbertson is currently chief executive of Sual. Elsewhere, oil and gas are being consolidated into Gazprom and Rosneft, the state energy companies, and aircraft building is being merged into the state-owned Unified Aircraft Corporation. Some automotive and machine building have come under the state weapons trader, Rosoboronexport. The proceeds from the initial public offering would be invested in mining assets outside of aluminum to meet a long-term strategy to form a global mining empire under Russian control, a company official said. He was not authorized to speak on the record because the company had not formally announced the talks. The goal would be to transform the merged company with a wide business plan embracing most materials that are dug from the earth, like coal and nickel, and capable of competing with the likes of other diversified mining companies like BHP Billiton, the company official said. Immediately after the merger, however, the combined company would produce about 4 million tons of aluminum a year, more than the 3.55 million tons Alcoa reported in 2005. Alcoa, a famous name in American business and a century-old company, has said its global growth strategy is not focused on maintaining a No. 1 position, but rather on meeting its internal goals to maintain profitability. The merged company would bring together three businessmen who all have a sense of swagger and colorful reputations, and who also all face varying degrees of legal risks. Mr. Rich made his fortune as an independent oil trader in the 1970s, as the world switched from longer-term oil contracts to the spot market deals that persist today. He specialized in conflict trading, buying oil from distressed parts of the world such as Sudan and Libya. Mr. Deripaska, Rusals owner, emerged the winner of a struggle for the Siberian aluminum industry, known as the aluminum wars, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He cemented his position in the Russian establishment in 2001 by marrying a woman who would soon be the stepgranddaughter of former President Boris N. Yeltsin.

With no economic data scheduled, the market focused on the impact of higher interest rates and energy costs on corporate profits. Disappointments from Alcoa and Lucent dragged the major indexes sharply lower before they rebounded late in the session  a sign that uncertain investors lacked information to drive stocks in one direction. “When the question is how much economic growth is going to slow, people are going to wait and see how profit reports come in before they make new commitments,” said Susan Malley of Malley Associates Capital Management. “We’re continuing to put money into the market, but not racing. In certain areas, we want to get as much information as we possibly can.” The Dow rose 31.22 points, or 0.28 percent, to 11,134.77, after tumbling as much as 75 points earlier. Broader stock indicators also reversed course to post moderate gains. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index added 5.18 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,272.52, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 11.93 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,128.86. Bonds rallied, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note rising 6/32, to 1006/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.10 percent, from 5.12 percent on Monday. The uncertain trading yesterday came amid further evidence of Wall Street’s confusion about the economy. Investors have become fearful that while rising interest rates are keeping inflation contained, they may be stunting economic growth and eating into corporate profits. Those worries were realized when Lucent, the diversified manufacturer 3M and the software maker EMC said their results would miss analysts’ predictions. Analysts were nonetheless upbeat about second-quarter earnings given the anticipated slowdown in economic growth in the latter half of 2006. “I think although earnings are going to be strong, they’re going to grow at a slower rate than over the last six months,” said Steve Neimeth, senior vice president at AIG SunAmerica. “With interest rates and energy going higher and the consumer weakening, there may be risks to those higher estimates.” Rising oil prices added to the market’s anxiety as energy traders monitored developments in talks with Iran over its nuclear arms program, and as they awaited the weekly update on United States reserves today. A barrel of light crude gained 55 cents, to $74.16, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The United States dollar slipped against the Japanese yen and was barely changed versus European currencies.

The telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies, which is being acquired by a French rival, Alcatel, said its income and sales for the June quarter would be less than analysts expected.

The Pepsi Bottling Group gained $1.61, to $33.96, after posting better-than-forecast earnings and revenue for the quarter and increasing its annual guidance. Here are the results of yesterday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills: More Articles in Business »By Associated Press Stocks recouped earlier losses to end modestly higher yesterday as investors set aside concern over an uneasy start to the second-quarter earnings season, which included weak results from Alcoa and a sales warning at Lucent Technologies. With no economic data scheduled, the market focused on the impact of higher interest rates and energy costs on corporate profits. Disappointments from Alcoa and Lucent dragged the major indexes sharply lower before they rebounded late in the session  a sign that uncertain investors lacked information to drive stocks in one direction. “When the question is how much economic growth is going to slow, people are going to wait and see how profit reports come in before they make new commitments,” said Susan Malley of Malley Associates Capital Management. “We’re continuing to put money into the market, but not racing. In certain areas, we want to get as much information as we possibly can.” The Dow rose 31.22 points, or 0.28 percent, to 11,134.77, after tumbling as much as 75 points earlier. Broader stock indicators also reversed course to post moderate gains. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index added 5.18 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,272.52, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 11.93 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,128.86. Bonds rallied, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note rising 6/32, to 1006/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.10 percent, from 5.12 percent on Monday. The uncertain trading yesterday came amid further evidence of Wall Street’s confusion about the economy. Investors have become fearful that while rising interest rates are keeping inflation contained, they may be stunting economic growth and eating into corporate profits. Those worries were realized when Lucent, the diversified manufacturer 3M and the software maker EMC said their results would miss analysts’ predictions.

"Rapidly rising health care costs depress the returns of our pension fund," said George Diehr, a health benefits official at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, with more than $180 billion in assets. Skip to next paragraph Ted S. Warren/Associated Press Boeing says its doesn't have the assets to cover its retiree health and other nonpension obligations. General Motors brought the issue to the fore last month, when Rick Wagoner, the company's chief executive, warned that "the health care crisis is putting our future at stake." And last Wednesday, discussing G.M.'s second-quarter loss, the company's chief financial officer, John M. Devine, said in a conference call with analysts that health care remained the company's biggest cost issue. But G.M. is hardly alone. Financial professionals say health costs are also a big drag on the investment value of the stocks and bonds of many other companies in heavy industries, as well as airlines, railroads, telecommunications and others. The companies under pressure are ones that promised medical coverage to their employees and retirees, in many cases long before the surging prices of new drugs and procedures sent costs spiraling. David Zion, an accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, estimates that companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index spent $30 billion on health care and other nonpension benefits for retirees in 2004. "It's a cash-flow issue for a lot of these companies," he said, "a cost that may be growing faster than the underlying business." While the financial risks of corporate pension obligations have been better publicized, portfolio managers and their advisers say health costs may pose even greater uncertainty. Compared with their pension safeguards, however fragile, most companies have no reserve funds at all to cover their future health outlays. Mr. Zion has analyzed pension commitments, as well as the health care promises that are listed as "other postretirement employee obligations" on Securities and Exchange Commission filings. "Time and again we noted that these 'other' plans were in worse shape than the pension plans," he said. Because of the soaring costs of health care coverage, an estimated 40 percent of companies with more than 5,000 employees no longer offer retiree health benefits. Among those that do, many finance employee and retiree health care on a pay-as-you-go basis. "Credit analysts see those promises as just more debt that a company owes," notes Ed Heilbron, a consultant with Mercer Investment Consulting. "And stock prices do reflect this." Larry Puglia, the lead portfolio manager of the Blue Chip Growth fund at T. Rowe Price, acknowledges that health obligations influence his investment strategy. "We typically would not have big exposure to General Motors and some of the manufacturers that have big pension and health care liabilities," he said. His fund, for example, does not include Boeing, which estimated its retiree health and other nonpension obligations at $8.14 billion at the end of last year, and has assets of less than $100 million to cover them. Nor does Mr. Puglia's fund hold shares of DuPont, which reported $4.8 billion in nonpension retiree obligations - with no assets to cover the obligations. The T. Rowe Price fund does have a big position in General Electric, mainly because G.E. is growing robustly, despite having reported $9.25 billion in retiree health obligations. The company has set aside assets of $1.65 billion toward covering those future benefits and says it plans to add $710 million this year. Richard Bernstein, the chief United States strategist for Merrill Lynch, says stock investors are probably less likely than bond holders to monitor health care pressures. Bond buyers, he said, "are very worried about the longer-term obligations of the company and the company's ability to pay those longer-term obligations." Standard &amp; Poor's, the bond-rating firm, said in April 2003 that it was putting two dozen companies on "credit watch with negative implications" to reflect, among other concerns, their poorly funded benefit commitments to retirees. One was Alcoa, whose credit rating was lowered a notch by S.&amp; P. to A- from A, "based on erosion of the company's financial profile, largely caused by its postretirement benefit costs." Alcoa recognized $3.8 billion in obligations to future retirees as of Dec. 31, 2004, according to a regulatory filing. Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Alcoa, said his company had strong cash flow - $2.2 billion last year - to amply cover its obligations, which included payments to retirees of $355 million in 2004. Like many employers, Alcoa has sought to rein in its commitments by curtailing its health care promises to recently hired workers. Employees hired after Jan. 1, 2002, will not receive health coverage as retirees. Recognizing the pressures on private employers, the federal Medicare program will give companies $50 billion in tax benefits to help with prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees over the next eight years, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office estimate. The credits are an incentive to keep private companies paying for drugs, one of the fastest-growing drivers of medical inflation, after Medicare starts its new drug program next year. "The Medicare bill was a very good first step," said Jerry Dubrowski, a General Motors spokesman. "It provided very significant savings to companies like G.M., but all of that was overwhelmed by the increasing medical costs." G.M., which does set aside money for future retiree benefits, has reported that the sum of its health care promises to retirees was $77.47 billion in 2004. That was up $9.93 billion from 2003 and included an estimated $4 billion in future Medicare drug subsidies. Scott Sprinzen, a bond analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, notes that health care inflation has moderated somewhat but that is still is far higher than general inflation and revenue growth rates, which remain in the low single digits for most companies. H.M.O.'s are listing premiums for 2006 that are up 12.9 percent from this year, according to a survey of large employers by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. Mr. Zion, the analyst, says that as health costs continue to outpace average corporate revenue growth, companies have dwindling options. "Either they keep covering these benefits, or try to cut the costs, pass more of costs to retirees, for example, or try to get the taxpayer to help through government subsidies," he said. Mr. Bernstein, at Merrill Lynch, sees "a big moral hazard issue embedded in this issue." "If we are not careful," he said, "we'll see a lot of corporations default on both their health care and their pensions. It's like a bond: cash flow runs short, you default on the bond."

Net income fell to $260 million, or 30 cents a share, from $355 million, or 41 cents a share, a year ago.

Those results include charges of 9 cents a share for the reorganization, tax on the sale of its Elkem investment, and integration and start-up costs for Russian plants. Sales rose 13 percent, to $6.29 billion, from $5.59 billion a year ago, driven by higher primary metal and aluminum prices as well as strength in the flat-rolled products, extruded products and engineered services segments. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting the company to post earnings of 39 cents a share before charges in the latest quarter on sales of $6.34 billion. Alcoa's earnings of 40 cents a share from continuing operations before charges beat the forecast by a penny a share, Thomson Financial said. "Underlying business performance improved in the quarter as we captured the benefits of higher metal prices and a stronger economy in North America," said Alain J. P.

H. Krome George, Who Led Alcoa, Dies at 86<date>Published: September 9, 2004</date><text>. H. Krome George, a former chairman and chief executive of Alcoa, who was credited with overseeing the company's expansion into a global concern, died on Monday in Mars, Pa. He was 86 and lived in Sewickley, Pa. The cause was complications of a heart attack and stroke he had last fall, his wife, Jean, said. Mr. George, a director of the company from 1967 until his retirement in 1988, spent most of his career at Alcoa. Under his leadership, it grew from a closely held domestic company to an international enterprise. Advertisement Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, is the world's leading producer of aluminum, doing business in more than 40 countries and known for brands like Reynolds wrap. "He was in the early ranks of C.E.O.'s that understood what it meant to be in a business that was defined as a world business," Paul O'Neill, the former treasury secretary, said yesterday. Mr. George helped bring Mr. O'Neill, a director and later chief executive of Alcoa, to the company in 1986. Mr. George became chief operating officer in 1972, chief executive in 1975 and chairman the same year. During his tenure, Alcoa's revenues increased to $5.3 billion in 1983 from $2.3 billion in 1975, the company said. William Henry Krome George was born in St. Louis on March 27, 1918, the son of Robert and Ann Krome George. Known as Krome, Mr. George was named for his grandfather, William Henry Krome, a chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court. After two years at the Virginia Military Institute, Mr. George transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and business administration in 1940. He joined Alcoa, then the Aluminum Company of America, in 1942 as a chemical engineer in its East St. Louis, Ill., plant. For industry executives, the metal's possibilities seemed boundless, from cookware to aluminum dresses (Paco Rabanne designed one). "There were a group of people, and Krome was one of them, that thought everything in the world ought to be made out of aluminum," Mr. O'Neill said.

The company, which is based in Pittsburgh, will have a pretax cost of $20 million this quarter for the job cuts, which will take effect around Oct. 1 and include hourly and salaried employees. The Wenatchee Aluminum Trade Council, which represents 325 hourly workers at the facility, rejected a proposal to join the company's health care plan and instead wanted free health care, an Alcoa spokesman, Kevin Lowery, said. Alcoa closed Wenatchee in 2001 when a dry summer pushed power prices to record highs.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/13/business/world-business-briefing-americas-brazil-packaging-unit-sold.html?ref=alcoainc">World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Packaging Unit Sold<date>Published: July 13, 2004</date><text>Alcoa, the aluminum maker, said it had sold its Brazilian flexible-packaging business, Itaipava, to Dixie Toga.

The investment includes $680 million to more than double alumina-refining capacity and $130 million to increase its smelting capacity by about a third at the Alumar plant in SÃ£o LuÃ­s, Brazil, a joint venture with BHP Billiton. Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, said it was also considering investing $350 million to develop a bauxite reserve. Alcoa owns 54 percent of the Alumar smelter on Brazil's northern coast and 35 percent of the plant's alumina-refining capacity. Alcoa shelved its Brazilian expansion plans in January, saying that the country's new electricity authority could hinder investment returns.</text></article></page></root>
