Madoff’s giant Ponzi scheme.In a decision released Tuesday, Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court in Manhattan ruled that the trustee, Irving H. Picard, did not have the legal right to pursue $20 billion in combined damage claims against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company and UBS. JPMorgan Chase served for decades as Mr. Madoff’s banker and also created and sold derivatives pegged to his investment performance. UBS provided various banking and administrative services to a host of European investment funds that steered money into Mr. Madoff’s hands. The ruling on Tuesday echoed the reasoning offered in July by Judge Jed S. Rakoff, also of United States District Court, when he barred the trustee from seeking a combined $8.8 billion in similar damage claims against HSBC, the London-based banking giant, and UniCredit, one of Italy’s largest banking groups. The banks’ arguments before Judge Rakoff persuaded him to dismiss the disputed claims, Judge McMahon noted in her opinion. “I am persuaded as well,” she said. As in the cases before Judge Rakoff, the issue before Judge McMahon was whether Mr. Picard, as the trustee for Mr. Madoff’s bankrupt estate, could sue the banks for harm they supposedly caused to Mr. Madoff’s investors, as opposed to harm inflicted on the bankrupt estate. And like Judge Rakoff, Judge McMahon determined that when Mr. Picard sued third parties for damages, he stood in the shoes of Mr. Madoff, the Ponzi schemer, not in the shoes of Mr. Madoff’s victims. Therefore, he could sue only if the defendants had harmed Mr. Madoff, which they clearly had not done, since their banking services facilitated the flow of cash into his fraud from around the world. Therefore, only Mr. Madoff’s creditors — his victims — have legal standing to sue the various bank defendants for damages, Judge McMahon said. Underlying Mr. Picard’s arguments was the question of whether those victims had the practical means or the leeway under bankruptcy law to individually pursue multibillion-dollar claims against a roster of global banks. The trustee’s lawsuits accused the defendant banks of willfully turning a blind eye to evidence that Mr. Madoff was operating a fraud, thereby allowing his scheme to continue and increasing the financial destruction it caused. Mr. Picard argued in court that federal law gave him the power to pursue those damage claims on behalf of the creditors. Judge McMahon acknowledged that “allowing the trustee to pursue claims that belong properly to individual creditors would accrue to the benefit of all creditors by augmenting the bankruptcy estate,” the primary source from which Mr. Picard hopes to compensate the cash losers in Mr. Madoff’s scheme. And she noted that if Mr. Picard were able to collect enough in damages, he could also make payments to those who lost only their paper profits in the scheme, although they would not receive as much as the cash losers. But those practicalities did not tilt her ruling in favor of Mr. Picard’s legal theory. “This theory is not supported by the statute’s text and history or by any persuasive case law,” Judge McMahon concluded. She said the points of law put forward by the trustee before her and before Judge Rakoff were “no more persuasive to me than they were to him.” As a result of her ruling, the trustee’s claims against the two giant banks will be limited to those that fall under the terms of the federal bankruptcy code, which allows Mr. Picard to recover fictional profits withdrawn during a specific period before the collapse of the Madoff fraud in December 2008. For JPMorgan Chase, according to the trustee’s calculations, those claims are less than $500 million, a fraction of the $19 billion Mr. Picard was seeking. However, he remains free to pursue just over half of the $2 billion he sought from UBS in the bankruptcy court. In a statement, the trustee’s lawyers said they had appealed Judge Rakoff’s ruling and intended to appeal this latest decision as well. The trustee and his counsel “remain confident in the cases,” the statement continued.For the second time this year, a federal judge has barred a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee from seeking billions in damages from big banks and other third parties to help compensate victims of Bernard L.

This is not a scam. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Nigeria, the West African nation that has gained notoriety for the illicit e-mail spammers aiming for Western bank accounts, is attracting attention for legitimate financial opportunities — investing its own savings. In an effort to preserve and increase its oil revenue, the country recently established a so-called sovereign wealth fund, following the path of many resource-rich countries. Now, Wall Street titans like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are courting top government officials, aiming to grab a piece of a portfolio that could eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars. “The country is at a point of inflection, and what we do in the next few years will set the pace,” said Olusegun Aganga, the former Nigerian finance minister and current minister for trade and investment, who helped create the sovereign wealth fund. “It’s a land of opportunities, which unfortunately has not been tapped well.” More than half a century after discovering oil in the Niger Delta, the country continues to subsist barrel to barrel. Poverty is rampant. Public corruption is pervasive. And the government coffers are bare, even though Nigeria is the 10th-largest oil producer in the world. By saving and investing the petro dollars, Nigeria hopes to break the resource curse. The nation, which derives 80 percent of its revenue from oil, created the sovereign wealth fund to buffer its economy from volatile commodity prices and impose fiscal discipline. The government so far has set aside $1 billion for the fund, and it could funnel as much as $2.5 billion a year, if oil prices remain high. “One of our biggest problems in civil society is the time horizon that we’re operating on — whether election cycles or quarterly reports,” said Ashby H.B. Monk, a research associate at the University of Oxford who studies sovereign wealth funds. “The idea of a sovereign fund is to give government bureaucrats an opportunity to make long-term policy knowing that the buffeting winds of capitalism won’t blow them off course.” Such funds have become powerful investment forces over the years. Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars by plowing their oil riches into stocks, bonds and other global assets. During the financial crisis, sovereign wealth funds provided critical capital to banks and other troubled firms. To grab a piece of the lucrative business, big banks and asset managers have tirelessly cultivated relationships with governments worldwide and added teams dedicated to sovereign wealth funds. In recent months, bankers, lawyers and consultants flew to the Nigerian capital of Abuja to pitch officials on their services. The government chose JPMorgan Chase as one of its advisers on the structuring of the fund. In other countries, the Wall Street feeding frenzy has drawn criticism. The Libyan Investment Authority, which was started in 2006, has complained that it lost millions of dollars on several investments, while money managers generated huge fees, according to documents leaked this summer to Global Witness, an advocacy group. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether American money managers, in trying to land business with sovereign wealth funds, violated antibribery laws, according to people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about the inquiry. “If you don’t get these organizations designed correctly as sophisticated investment operations, you can lose a lot of money,” Mr. Monk said. “It’s the power of finance — for good or bad.” Nigeria’s new fund is the brainchild of Mr. Aganga, a Nigerian native who worked at Ernst &amp; Young’s London office before joining Goldman Sachs in 2001. Last year, the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, asked Mr. Aganga to join his cabinet. As the minister of finance, Mr. Aganga pushed to start a sovereign wealth fund almost immediately. He had helped oversee part of Goldman’s Africa business, and knew Nigeria was among the last oil-rich nations without an investment portfolio. “It’s important that we have some savings for the future generations,” Mr. Aganga said. “It just makes sense for your economy. You’re completely exposed otherwise.” But Nigeria has a spotty record managing its money. In 2004, the country started plowing extra oil revenue into a separate account, as a way to build savings. At one point, the portfolio held an estimated $20 billion, analysts say. The funds did not last long. State and federal authorities leaders regularly siphoned off money to fill budget holes, build utilities or pay for other projects. By last year, the assets had plummeted to less than $1 billion. “There were no rules about withdrawals or whom it belonged to among the three tiers of government in Nigeria,” said Razia Khan, head of African research at Standard Chartered Bank. To avoid making the same mistakes, Nigeria is earmarking assets for different purposes in a structure that mirrors older sovereign wealth funds. One portfolio, which will invest in stocks and bonds, is focused on long-term growth in preparation for the day when the oil wells run dry. An infrastructure portfolio will support upgrades to the country’s bridges, roads, buildings and railways. During periods of weakness, the government will have an emergency account to prop up the economy. But officials will be able to access the money only under certain circumstances, like a steep drop in oil prices. Commitment will be crucial. Some politicians are already grumbling that the sovereign wealth fund will divert assets that the economy desperately needs now, and they are threatening to derail the effort. Such pressure, said John Campbell, a former United States ambassador to Nigeria and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research center, could prompt the country to “raid the cookie jar” to deal with short-term issues. “Unless there is the political will to live up to those aspirations,” he said, “it’s not going to work very well.” “My view is, better mute the trumpets for the time being,” Mr. Campbell said. It will come down to execution, say Nigerian officials and outside analysts. The government is tapping an independent board to oversee the investment process and to ensure compliance. While critics point to the delay in naming those directors as a potential concern, authorities defend their position. They argue that the new finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former managing director at the World Bank, who was sworn in this August, needs time to learn all about existing matters. The board “will define how effective this becomes,” said Fola Oyeyinka, an adviser to the Nigerian minister of finance. “The flavor of that board will dictate not just to Nigerians but to the world how serious we are.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/the-bank-buyback-boom/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">The Bank Buyback Boom<date>October 20, 2011, 12:34 pm</date><text>JPMorgan Chase bought more of its own stock in the third quarter than the amount of its earnings.

With the bank shrinking its balance sheet and selling off assets, the company, based in Charlotte, N.C., surrendered its title as the country's biggest bank Tuesday, another sign of how a money-losing giant assembled over decades is being reshaped into a smaller and, investors hope, more profitable institution. Bank of America, with $2.22 trillion in assets reported Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings, is now second to JPMorgan Chase, which has $2.29 trillion assets. It also ranks second to JPMorgan Chase in terms of branches and total deposits. Analysts said it was more evidence of how Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, is reversing the legacy of his controversial predecessor, Ken Lewis, an empire builder who craved being the biggest in United States banking and whose creation ultimately needed two federal bailouts to survive the financial crisis. ''There's been a huge philosophical change in who they want to be,'' said Mike Mayo, a veteran bank analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. ''This is a milestone that marks the end of a two-decade-long period during which they aspired and eventually became the largest bank.'' In today's slow-growth economy, though, bigger is not necessarily better. And the challenges Bank of America still faces were evident in the numbers it released Tuesday. Buoyed by one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, Bank of America reported a $6.23 billion profit for the third quarter, but the headline number camouflaged weak results in many of its businesses. Still, investors cheered the news, pushing the bank's shares up 10 percent to $6.64 a share. Although its investment bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has been a crucial source of profit recently as other businesses like mortgage lending hemorrhaged money, the slow trading environment and financial uncertainty in Europe caused trading revenue to drop. The company's global banking and markets revenue fell to $5.2 billion from $7 billion, and the unit reported a $302 million loss in the third quarter, a sharp contrast to the $1.46 billion gain a year ago. Mr. Mayo estimated that the bank's underlying core revenues dropped 17 percent, as other businesses like global commercial banking, card services and consumer real estate services also posted declines from a year ago. One exception was the company's wealth management business, where revenue and net income both rose. Still, the story behind the $6.23 billion profit was mostly a tale of one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, including $4.5 billion from positive adjustments to the value of its outstanding debt, a $1.7 billion accounting gain on the perceived riskiness of its debt and a pretax gain of $3.6 billion from the sale of half its stake in China Construction Bank. ''It's not like 2007 or 2008 where there are losses that threaten the bank's capital's position,'' said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. ''But nothing was particularly great and trading was very weak.'' Without the special items, Bank of America would have earned about $2.7 billion, which included pulling back $1.7 billion it had set aside, largely for borrowers who fail to pay their consumer and credit card loans. Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, counted 15 special items in the quarter, down from 16 in the second quarter but more than the 12 in the first quarter. ''It's a big company undergoing a transformation.'' The bank reported net income of 56 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.3 billion or 77 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts had been expecting the bank to earn 28 cents a share in the third quarter. Revenue rose to $28.7 billion from $26.9 billion, although that too was pumped by one-time gains. For investors, the red ink flowing from Bank of America's disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant, remains the biggest worry. Both the federal government and private investors are seeking compensation for tens of billions of dollars in losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/bank-of-america-gives-up-its-title-as-biggest-in-u-s/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Bank of America Loses Title as Biggest in U.S.<date>October 18, 2011, 9:07 pm</date><text>Jeffrey Camarati/Bloomberg NewsBrian T.

For investors, the red ink flowing from Bank of America’s disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant, remains the biggest worry. Both the federal government and private investors are seeking compensation for tens of billions of dollars in losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages. Part of the reason investors breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday was that the red ink from subprime mortgages eased in the last quarter. Provisions for so-called put-backs, in which investors try to force the bank to buy back soured mortgages by arguing they were improperly originated and bundled into securities, fell to $278 million. In the second quarter, these provisions totaled a whopping $14 billion, including an $8 deal billion with investors that include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Litigation costs fell to $290 million from $1.5 billion in the second quarter. In 2006, Bank of America surpassed Citigroup to become the biggest bank by market capitalization, an event that can be seen as a high-water mark of Mr. Lewis’s era. Today, its $67 billion market value lags Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Bruce R. Thompson, the company’s chief financial officer, said he expected assets to keep shrinking in the coming months, as some loans come due and are not renewed and the company’s Canadian credit card business is sold in the fourth quarter. “We’re not focused on the size of the balance sheet, what we’re focused on is getting the balance sheet that’s best for our customers and best for us,” he said. In fact, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup showed slight growth in terms of total loans in the third quarter, Bank of America’s overall loan portfolio declined by about 0.9 percent compared with the second quarter, Mr. Goldberg noted. The company’s headcount is also set to drop sharply from the 290,509 recorded during the third quarter. Roughly 2,000 employees were told last quarter their jobs were being eliminated, and 30,000 more are set to go over the next three years as part of Project New BAC, an efficiency initiative aimed at cutting $5 billion in expenses in its first phase. Mr. Moynihan defended Bank of America’s controversial new $5-a-month debit card fee Tuesday, arguing that customers who bring more of their banking business to the company will be able to avoid it.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/banks-start-to-make-more-loans/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Banks Start to Make More Loans<date>October 17, 2011, 9:58 pm</date><text>Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot. Loan growth is still modest. And it remains heavily weighted toward the strongest corporate and consumer borrowers. But after several quarters of having their loan balances plunge or flatten out, several of the nation’s biggest banks are reporting increases. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink On Monday, Citigroup officials said the bank recorded loan growth, compared with a year ago, in almost every one of its businesses during the third quarter, and in almost every corner of the globe. Wells Fargo executives said new loan commitments to small businesses were up 8 percent, while lending to bigger companies has been growing for 14 months in a row. Across the industry, analysts expect credit card loan balances will start increasing before the end of the year. “The narrative that banks aren’t lending is incorrect,” Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “Lending is strong, and based on what we’re seeing,” he added, it will “continue to grow.” Still, the stocks of both banks, and the sector as a whole, dropped on Monday as the sluggish economy and revenue figures pointed to broad drags on the banks, including low returns on making loans and exposure to the European debt crisis. But the new lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but it looks like the recovery is still here,” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chairman and chief executive, said after heralding his bank’s lending data last week. There are myriad explanations behind the uptick in loan growth, including more customers taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates and borrowers in need of cash drawing on their credit lines. Others believe the downbeat headlines in recent weeks have been overblown. If the confidence clouds hanging over Europe and the United States were removed, the lending figures would be even stronger, analysts and bankers say. Housing remains the banking industry’s Achilles’ heel. Mortgage and home equity loans have fallen more than 6.2 percent since their peak in late 2007 and early 2008, according to weekly data from the Federal Reserve. Most banks have ratcheted up the underwriting criteria so that fewer new borrowers qualify for a loan, especially in the housing markets along the coasts that were hit hard by the recession. As existing loans end, they are less likely to replace them with a new one. But there has been a modest increase in lending elsewhere. Over all, corporate lending has rebounded 7.2 percent after bottoming out in October 2010. Consumer lending, with the exception of housing-related loans, turned positive during the second quarter and has been gradually increasing since then, the data show. All told, total loan balances are near where they stood in mid-2007. “The banks want to lend,” said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. After all, he said, more than 70 percent of their income is tied to that activity. And the Federal Reserve survey of loan officers shows that banks have been gradually relaxing their underwriting requirements. Others, however, say the banks are still clinging to their purse strings. For a broader recovery, they will need to make loans more available to more consumer borrowers with blemished credit histories and a broader array of small businesses, the critics say. “I don’t think the lending window is open near enough to what you need to see to get the economy growing, businesses expanding, and to bring the unemployment rate down,” said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm. So far, the revival in lending has not been strong enough to significantly move the revenue needle for the nation’s biggest banks, either. The poor performance of their Wall Street-related businesses and the elimination of once-lucrative overdraft and credit card penalty fees have weighed on their results. Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013. On Monday, Citigroup reported that its core revenue fell 8 percent, even as it squeezed out a $3.8 billion profit with some favorable accounting. It booked a $1.9 billion paper gain since the cost of retiring its debt had, theoretically, declined because of concerns over its financial condition. It also delivered about $1.4 billion to its bottom line, using money it had previously set aside to cover credit card and other loan losses. Together, those moves accounted for 67 percent of its pretax earnings. Wells Fargo also reported a 6 percent drop in revenue, as several major divisions, like its vast mortgage operations and its investment banking businesses, reported a decline from last year. But the bank still managed a record $4.1 billion profit, thanks in part to a sharp reduction in charge-offs and the release of $800 million in loan loss reserves. But buried in the numbers of both big banks were signs that loan growth was modestly improving. Citigroup pointed to healthy demand in emerging markets, which have only recently started to feel the impact of the global slowdown. In Asia, for example, corporate loans grew 22 percent, while card lending increased by about 4 percent, excluding the impact of the exchange rate. Citi’s Latin American operations showed similar resilience, while even the North American business showed a slight increase in lending, with the exception of mortgages. Much of it is not “forced lending” as borrowers tap credit lines because they are in desperate need of money to pay their bills, Citi executives said. Small-business customers are “drawing them down because they have real needs and we are extending additional commitments,” said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. “Absent the continued uncertainty, you would likely have loans growing and the economy growing at a faster rate.” Executives at Wells Fargo, whose giant lending operations are largely focused on consumer and corporate borrowers in the United States, said that “customer sentiment is good” even though some of the economic data worsened during the third quarter. “It’s not just energy or commercial real estate; it’s really across the board,” said Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer at Wells Fargo. Some of the growth was due to foreign lenders ceding some ground to Wells and other large American banks, rather than an overall increase in demand. The uptick in Wells Fargo’s commercial lending business was aided, in part, by a $1.1 billion commercial real estate portfolio it bought from the Bank of Ireland. Even its mortgage business, which reported more than a 50 percent jump in home loan applications, owed some of the lending growth to consumers refinancing existing loans — not people obtaining new ones. On Thursday, Mr. Dimon was keen to highlight JPMorgan’s lending numbers in an otherwise sobering quarter. Lending to small businesses with less than $50 million in revenue was up 70 percent through this year compared with the same period in 2010, while lending to middle-market customers was up 18 percent. “These are pretty powerful numbers,” Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with journalists. “We look at loan growth translating to jobs.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/opinion/the-big-banks-falter.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">The Big Banks Falter<date>Published: October 13, 2011</date><text>As the first of the major banks to report its earnings each quarter, JPMorgan Chase is a barometer of conditions in the financial industry. The mercury is falling.JPMorgan reported on Thursday that its third-quarter revenue had dropped by 11 percent from the second quarter; its profit fell by 4 percent from a year earlier. And since JPMorgan is arguably one of the nation’s healthier banks, results for firms like Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are likely to be considerably worse. These declines are worrisome in the sense that they reflect the weakness of the broader economy. Joblessness, damaged credit and falling home values have left people unable to borrow or to repay debt and businesses reluctant to hire and invest. But the results also reflect how the banks built profits abusing their customers. Long overdue federal restrictions on hidden overdraft charges and excessive debit card fees have begun to take a bite out of bank profits, and that should be happening. But the banks and their investors tend to see any rules and regulations that slow revenue growth as undue and overly burdensome, and they are pushing back. The question is whether lawmakers and regulators will stand up for the new fee restrictions and other rules as banks resist. Banks, habituated to gouging their customers, are already trying to recoup lost revenue with dubious new charges, like Bank of America’s $5 monthly fee for using a debit card. The move has infuriated customers and led President Obama to rightly warn against mistreatment of customers in the pursuit of profit. But Bank of America has yet to relent — a stubbornness that may be from of a belief that aggrieved customers won’t do better elsewhere. On Thursday, five Democratic congressmen led by Peter Welch of Vermont asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the big banks were engaging in “price signaling,” a form of collusion in the setting of prices. The big banks are also resisting proposed regulations on capital levels, derivatives and investing practices. If successfully implemented, the new rules will help to curb the kind of reckless trading and irresponsible lending that caused the crash and recession. That will slow revenue growth, but it is the price of a more stable system. The banks also have gotten themselves into a legal mess for which they have no one to blame but themselves. JPMorgan had to set aside another $1 billion last quarter to prepare for legal claims from investors who want to recoup their loss from mortgage bonds backed by bad loans. The banks face legal challenges from federal and state governments over foreclosure abuses and other mortgage-related issues. In all, analysts say mortgage problems could cost JPMorgan up to $9 billion. Bank of America, the most exposed of the big banks to mortgage-related litigation, is potentially on the hook for far more. Investors, meanwhile, are pricing banks’ stocks below the banks’ book value — a sign that they don’t believe the banks are worth what the banks say they are. The questions generally involve whether banks are properly valuing their loans and investments and the extent of their exposure to shaky European debt. Banks could fix this with increased and detailed disclosure. Government officials and regulators could compel that disclosure. The general failure on this front feeds the air of skepticism. One of the lessons from the financial crash is that there is no substitute for transparency. In the new earnings season, investors are still in the dark.As the first of the major banks to report its earnings each quarter, JPMorgan Chase is a barometer of conditions in the financial industry.

Citigroup dropped 5.3 percent, Morgan Stanley 4.4 percent and Bank of America 5.5 percent. JPMorgan is the first big American bank to announce quarterly results. Next week Wells Fargo &amp; Company, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley will report. JPMorgan is considered one of the industry’s leaders, so its results do not bode well for other financial companies, said Jason Lilly, a portfolio manager at Rockland Trust Investment Management Group. An afternoon rally in technology stocks trimmed some of Wall Street’s losses. Yahoo rose 1 percent as investors speculated the company might be bought. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite rose 15.5 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,620. “There’s a mounting interest in Yahoo and that has filtered out into tech stocks,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. The S.&amp; P. 500 index fell 3.59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,203.66. Financial stocks fell 2.4 percent, the most of the 10 company groups that make up the index. Investors were also disappointed by a report that China’s trade surplus narrowed for a second month in September. That suggests the Chinese economy is slowing more than previously thought, which could hurt demand for exports from the United States. The United States trade deficit was essentially unchanged in August at $45.6 billion, with exports and imports both slipping. Lower imports are a bad sign for the United States economy, since it shows weakness in demand. Before Thursday, stocks had soared for a week on signs that Europe was starting to get a handle on its financial crisis. The Dow had rallied 8.1 percent since last Tuesday, when it hit its lowest point of the year. The S.&amp; P. Poor’s 500-index rose even more in that time, 9.8 percent. That was the biggest seven-day jump for the S.&amp; P. since March 2009, when the market hit 12-year lows. The sharp highs and lows are typical of the volatility that has plagued markets since August, when investors began reacting to fears that indebted economies in Europe would collapse and the United States would slide back into recession. Many analysts say they think the market is in for more big swings until a resolution to Europe’s debt is reached. “Europe will definitely contribute to more volatility. That story isn’t done,” said Mr. Lilly. In corporate news, the BlackBerry maker Research in Motion fell 1.13 percent after a three-day outage that cut off service to users across the world. The company said it fixed the problem, which resulted from a breakdown in its European infrastructure. The Blackstone Group lost 5.4 percent after a Citi Investment Research analyst dropped the private equity firm from a list of favorite stocks, saying the firm would not be able to make strong real estate investments for some time because of the weak economy. Netflix rose 3 percent after the company secured a deal with Warner Brothers Television Group and CBS to stream programs from the CW television network. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 16/32. The yield fell to 2.18 percent, from 2.21 percent late Wednesday. In Europe, Britain’s FTSE 100 closed down 0.7 percent, while Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 were both 1.3 percent lower. Oil prices meanwhile tracked European equities lower — benchmark oil was down $1.33 to $84.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday, weighed down by bank stocks after JPMorgan Chase reported that a slowdown in investment banking had hurt its results in the third quarter.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/jpmorgan-profit-falls-4-to-4-26-billion/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Profit Falls 4%, to $4.26 Billion<date>October 13, 2011, 7:26 am</date><text>8:57 p.m. | Updated Despite a paper gain that helped lift earnings by nearly $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company reported on Thursday that profit fell 4 percent in the third quarter amid lingering mortgage troubles and weak investment banking results. Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States. The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60. Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but the recovery is still here,” Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter. The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter. That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit. Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank’s results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth. One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan’s investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank’s employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 — an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions. As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses. The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company. Investors are so concerned about the banks’ prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits. What’s more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies. The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan’s investment bank’s results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank’s large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets. Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September. Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. “We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails,” he said. Chase Home Lending, the bank’s mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon. “We don’t expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers,” Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. “It’s hard not to be cautious.” On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion. The bank’s other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase’s large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations. JPMorgan’s asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE3D81E39F930A25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">DealBook Online<date>Published: October 13, 2011</date><text>CLEANING THE CLOSET Liz Claiborne, the women's apparel maker, announced on Wednesday the sale of its namesake brand and Monet to J.

The aim of Wednesday’s event, according to the demonstrators’ Facebook event page, is this: We’ll be headed to 1 Chase Plaza (Pine and William, just off Wall Street) with a bunch of our friends from #OccupyWallStreet to ask why New York State is going to give Jamie Dimon over $436,000 in a new state tax cut next year. Bebeto Matthews/Associated PressProtesters marched on Wednesday toward One Chase Manhattan Plaza in downtown Manhattan, near Occupy Wall Street’s base camp in Zuccotti Park. The organizers acknowledge that Chase Manhattan Plaza is one of JPMorgan’s offices. Mr. Dimon’s actual offices are at 270 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, as are most of the banking giant’s operations. JPMorgan continues to occupy significant space at Chase Manhattan Plaza, though the building mostly houses the firm’s treasury and security services, as well as administrative functions. In case protesters want to check out JPMorgan’s other offices, they can look at the map DealBook created of the firm’s Midtown Manhattan offices in 2008, following the firm’s takeover of Bear Stearns. Some things have changed: JPMorgan no longer occupies space at 245 Park Avenue or 345 Park Avenue. But most of the firm’s top brass is at 270 Park, while the investment bank is largely located at the old Bear building at 383 Madison Avenue.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/between-the-lines-morgan-stanley-faces-deficit-of-trust/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Between the Lines, Wall St. Banks Face a Deficit of Trust<date>October 12, 2011, 12:16 pm</date><text>Ramin Talaie/Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley shares are down 42 percent this year. All big bank stocks had double-digit dips. By almost any measure, Morgan Stanley is fine. Look at this impressive rundown of the bank’s critical numbers and ratios from Paul Gulberg, an investment banking analyst with the independent research firm Portales Partners. Morgan Stanley has much more capital and lower leverage than it did at the height of the financial crisis, which I like to think of as 9/08. It has almost $60 billion in common equity, compared with $36 billion before September 2008, and its ratios are stronger. Its trading book — which is volatile and where any bank can take sudden, large losses — is smaller than it was. Morgan Stanley has more long-term debt and higher deposits, both of which stabilize its finances. The bank has more cash available in case there’s a crunch and a smaller amount of Level III assets, which don’t have an independently verifiable value and so must be estimated by the bank. Hedge funds have parked a smaller amount of assets at Morgan Stanley. That’s good because in the financial crisis, they pulled them from the bank. Yes, Morgan Stanley by any measure is a safe and solid investment bank. Except for one: The amount of trust people have in the whole financial and political system. It’s just about zero. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink That’s why the bank’s shares are down 42 percent this year. That’s why all the big bank stocks have had double-digit dips. True, they start their next round of quarterly reporting in a matter of days. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, and its earnings may calm fears temporarily. But the essential problem will still be there, a slow burn beneath the global financial system that flares up at the worst moments. Banks don’t have faith in other banks, investors are deeply scarred and wary, and nobody believes that the governments around the world could grapple with the magnitude of the problems, even if they wanted to. Three months ago, the French-Belgian bank Dexia passed the European stress tests. By that measure, it was fine. Then it collapsed. This weekend France, Belgium and Luxembourg swooped in to save Dexia and pledged to figure out how to recapitalize European banks as a whole. So investors had a moment of euphoria on Monday: Governments will save institutions! While they probably won’t hesitate to wipe out equity holders in failed financial institutions and will perhaps force the value of bondholders’ investments to be trimmed, they will do everything they can to protect counterparties so that the system doesn’t collapse. That’s the hope, at least, and it has a rational basis. Almost universally, regulators and political leaders believe that letting Lehman fail in the fall of 2008 was a disastrous mistake. Its downfall cascaded throughout the global financial world, collapsing money markets, terrifying lenders to banks and accelerating the implosion of multiple financial institutions. So investors and policy makers, burned by the recent crisis, are all supposed to be acting more prudently and forcefully. Yet, the moment one examines almost any detail of the global financial system, faith falters once again. Take the uncertainty about the derivatives markets. Morgan Stanley has a face value of $56 trillion in derivatives. That’s really nothing. JPMorgan Chase has more — amounting to the G.D.P. of large countries — a face value of $79 trillion in derivatives. If something goes wrong with just one-tenth of 1 percent of those trades, it’s kablooie. Now those are gross numbers. Many people would dismiss those totals as ridiculous and misleading. Anyone who brings them up is merely displaying ignorance. The banks’ derivatives portfolios are full of off-setting trades that net out at a smaller number. Derivatives can be dismissed as a popular bugaboo, but they really are just a symbol of the larger problem. A recitation of daily stories reveals all kinds of reasons that banks don’t trust each other. To take just one news item, almost at random: Bloomberg News reported the other day that a Danish bank was refusing French sovereign debt as collateral. Nobody really knows how much exposure the American banks have to the European financial and political crisis. The Treasury Department minimizes the issue while other outlets raise the specter of catastrophic problems. So trust, naturally, is the casualty. “If you get in a period of stress, everyone starts questioning whether the hedges will hold up and whether the collateral is good enough,” said Mr. Gulberg, the banking analyst. Surely no bank would be so reckless as to accept dodgy collateral these days. It would hold out for something unassailable, like, say, Triple A mortgages on American homes. Wait, scratch that. It would accept sovereign debt, perhaps from some European realm that has been around for centuries. Whoops, no, no. Well, O.K., maybe United States Treasuries — and we’ll agree to ignore that one of the country’s two major political parties was willing to plunge the United States into default to achieve its aims. So there’s concern about the collateral. But what about the hedges? Of course, they wouldn’t hedge with some bank like Dexia, which at year-end had $700 billion worth of loans, undrawn commitments, financial guarantees and the like. Some financial institutions have to be on the other side of Dexia’s commitments. Some might even be those supposedly strong and prudent banks that were supposed to have learned so much from the financial crisis. Did Morgan Stanley learn its lesson from the crisis?

Woolery left one of the plum legal jobs in the world, as a partner at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, to become the co-head of North America mergers and acquisitions alongside Chris Ventresca at JPMorgan Chase. At Cravath, Mr. Woolery was one of the rising young superstars at the firm, advising Air Products on its $6 billion hostile offer for Airgas, Affiliated Computer Services in its $6.4 billion acquisition by Xerox and TXU in the largest private equity deal in history, its sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG. He is off to a strong start at JPMorgan, already advising on two of the biggest deals of the year: AT&amp;T on its $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA and Meco Health Solutions in a $29.1 billion acquisition by Express Scripts.

Q. You turned investment banker from a lawyer and partner at Cravath. What has been the big difference between the two jobs? A. JPMorgan is a large, diverse company. The number of different people I come into contact with, internally and externally, in a given week is enormous. I enjoy the people side of the business — so it’s a plus. Cravath is an amazing firm. By definition, you are deeply involved in a fixed number of client projects there — rewarding work. The number of people you interact with in the job is greater here. Q. Do you find your law background useful? A. Very useful. Every transaction has a financial and a legal side to it. To marry the two in a way that prioritizes issues for the client and achieves the client’s goals is helpful to me — and more importantly is of great value to the client. The law — and great lawyering — is a worthwhile, important profession. It is very important to folks who have spent time in the practice – regardless of their career path. Q. What’s your day-to-day life like? A. I spend a good part of the day with clients of JPMorgan — whether they are engaged in a transaction or not. I travel a fair bit — so the old saw about bankers and airplanes is true. I spend the balance of my time with my partners across the company — Jimmy Lee in the investment bank, Doug Petno and Rob Holmes in the commercial bank, John Duffy in the private bank, Jim Casey and Andy O’Brien in leveraged finance, Isabelle Seillier and Severin Brizay in Paris, and so on. We are in a unique position to deliver JPMorgan across industries, across products and across regions. In order to do that, we maintain an incredibly active dialogue with each other, and in between all of that, my partner, Chris Ventresca, and I spend time on the M.&amp;A. floor every day, in the analyst bullpen and in the managing directors’ offices. There is simply no substitute for personal interaction in our business. Q. I would suspect that you are pitching business much more now. What have you learned about how to make a good “pitch”? A. This business is extremely competitive. To win a pitch, you have to demonstrate that you have the team and the ideas to deliver for the client. You also have to sell it straight — some of the best advice we give is not to do a deal. So put M.&amp;A. with capital markets, industry know-how, rollout capability, market and investor relations, senior JPMorgan leadership and stay with it — and you will be successful. I find I pitch better when I let my partners do most of the talking. Q. What about AT&amp;T and Medco in terms of approval? These are big deals — lots of implications. A. Both deals are in review and the clients are managing the process, so I would defer to them to comment specifically. I will say in general that antitrust policy in this country should be struck in terms of what is good for consumers and what will enhance a consumer-centric economy. You cannot benefit the consumer by locking up the economy. Our businesses must be fit to compete in a global arena. Given the velocity of the global economy, we must be careful not to fight the last war in terms of policy, but the government has a job to do — that it is mandated to do — and it’s a process. Patience with the process is a necessity. Q. To what extent is your job balance-sheet banking? How much do your skills matter versus the fact that you can provide the necessary financing for deals? A. Strategic advisory skills are crucial to achieving an M.&amp;A. role. Clients are sophisticated. They can choose financing banks and M.&amp;A. advisers. If it were otherwise, boutiques would not exist. So the notion that providing the balance sheet delivers the M.&amp;A. role is just plain wrong — and the numbers bear that out. We have more sell-side assignments this year with no financing role than we have assignments with financing — and we still lead the tables when you take out deals with our financing. Having said that, combining M.&amp;A. advice with financing advice — particularly in these challenging markets — is a winning combination. You need both to deliver a complete advisory service to clients. Q. How do you see the M.&amp;A. market unfolding over the next year or so? A. This market is trading on macro concerns that have a political and regulatory genesis. The market wants clarity and resolution. It will be a bumpy ride for a few months — with continued volatility — and then the market will begin to look to the U.S. elections in the spring for direction. What is different now versus 2009 is that many companies are well capitalized with access to attractive financing. Investors want that capital deployed to achieve growth, including through synergistic, scale, core acquisitions. The market has rewarded buyers who move in that direction. We have many clients who want to play offense in these markets to drive shareholder value. So deals will occur and will gather steam into the second quarter of next year. But overall deal volume will probably be challenging until the market gets the clarity it wants and equity values level off. The sooner we get clarity, the sooner volumes will return. The demand for deals is there. Q. It is almost four years after the credit crisis began and private equity still has yet to do a $7 billion deal. What will it take for this to happen? A. The market for large, leveraged deals is choppy right now. Deals of size demand more equity and carry more risk. Having said that, when the economy begins to grow at a sustainable, foreseeable rate, leverage will be more attainable, valuations will be more robust and shareholders will want the opportunity to take money off the table, including through larger LBOs. We aren’t there yet, but sponsors are creative — and they will adapt and deploy capital in a variety of ways to achieve returns. We believe more sponsors will look to bridge companies through choppy markets and will of course look to public company carve-outs, including large carve-outs, in which to invest. A large LBO will happen at some point — and then we will stop talking about when and if. Q. You represented Air Products in its hostile bid for Airgas. The Delaware court now famously refused to redeem Air Products poison pill. Now that you have had almost a year to reflect on that, do you have any thoughts on the decision? A. The bylaw and the pill decision are the Delaware law now. Litigation is not a forum that lends itself to deal-making — though it can sometimes provide a backdrop for negotiation. The key issue is and will remain the balance of governance power between shareholders and boards. Looking at the market as a whole, it may be that shareholders who have more of a say on important deals may be less concerned with legislating individual issues like compensation — where shareholders are not positioned to act. The best defense is not lawyered; it is good shareholder relations and good performance. I will leave the rest to the commentators who are still writing about these decisions. Q. When you advise potential bidders on hostile transactions now, what do you advise them? A. We now have a regime that falls into three buckets: (1) staggered boards, (2) annual elections and (3) action by written consent. The ability to achieve a transaction through the shareholder franchise is very different depending on which bucket you are in. Look at what we have gone through this year — in terms of changing markets. Look at how fast information flows and how quickly markets, global markets, move. The notion that a public company is going to take a transaction through two election cycles over a two-year period in these markets is pretty far-fetched. Very few will attempt that path. Annually elected boards and companies with written consent will see more shareholder offers. Q. When you were a partner at Cravath, you were featured in an article in The Dallas Morning News talking about how you did well in Texas because you could “talk Texan” since you were raised by a small-town Kentucky lawyer. Does it work as well in banking? A. It’s not where you come from that matters. Identifying with people who don’t live in New York City — who run businesses in small towns and large cities — does matter. We are in a client-service business. Approaching clients with humility, combined with know how that is offered from the client’s point of view, makes a difference. Clients appreciate straight talk. They taught straight talk in Kentucky. We have a straight-talking C.E.O., so I think they teach that in more than one place. Q. Some say you are following in the steps of Rob Kindler who also left Cravath and is now global head of M.&amp;A. at Morgan Stanley. Who would win in a steel cage wrestling match, you or Kindler, and why? A. Rob Kindler is one of the funniest, quick-witted people you will meet. He is also a great banker. So he may have an advantage in the cage because he would get you laughing — then move in on you. Maybe I would take him on the basketball court. We could sell tickets for the March of Dimes, a great cause of his; Rob would be tough no matter what the game was. I’ll take that as a challenge, and DealBook will sponsor if Rob accepts.

Campaign Cash News and analysis on campaign fund-raising. Many of them are picking Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who has avidly courted Wall Street. In the last 48 hours Mr. Romney has personally called some of the party’s top uncommitted donors and “bundlers” to persuade them to join his team, focusing on those who had held out hope for a White House bid by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. One of Mr. Romney’s latest and most high-profile recruits is James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of the JPMorgan Chase and a Christie fan, according to two people with knowledge of Mr. Lee’s discussions with the Romney campaign. Mr. Lee raised over $500,000 for Senator John McCain‘s 2008 presidential campaign and has been among the most sought-after Republican donors in the country. Mr. Lee joins two other JPMorgan executives on Mr. Romney’s finance team: Frank J. Bisignano, the firm’s chief admimistrative officer and head of mortgage banking, who will host a December event in New York for Mr. Romney with other JP Morgan executives; and Mary Callahan Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan Chase’s asset management unit, those people said. Mr. Romney has also picked up the support of two financiers who once supported President Obama: Daniel S. Loeb and Clifford S. Asness, both of them prominent and outspoken hedge fund managers who have emerged in recent months with sharp criticism of the president and his fiscal or regulatory policies.

Now, as regulators in Washington and abroad mandate larger capital cushions at the world’s largest financial firms, the industry is railing against what it describes as too much of a good thing. The Clearing House Association, one of Wall Street’s oldest and most influential trade groups, warned in a new report that requiring layers of bank capital protection would devastate the industry’s returns and have a chilling effect on the economy. The report, sent this week to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve‘s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, argued that Wall Street was already well-capitalized, at least compared with the dark days of the financial crisis. The report, according to the Clearing House, “strongly suggests that additional capital requirements may serve little benefit at best, and most likely will burden market participants with unnecessary costs.” Since the crisis, the report said banks had added some $200 billion in Tier 1 common equity, a crucial measure that regulators use to assess the health of an institution. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Clearing House Association report But that is not saying much. When Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, it had a debt-to-equity ratio of about 30 to 1, meaning it was borrowing $30 for every dollar in capital it held. Bear Stearns, another dangerously undercapitalized firm, also collapsed. Some 700 other banks collected more than $200 billion in taxpayer bailout funds to keep afloat. A collection of international financial regulators, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, approved far-reaching new rules last year that raised minimum capital requirements for big banks across the world. The so-called Basel III rules will require banks to raise the amount of common equity they hold to 7 percent of assets from 2 percent. This summer, the committee proposed increasing the capital levels even further, by 1 to 2.5 percentage points, for the biggest and most interconnected banks. And that does not even count the new requirements stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the so-called too-big-to-fail banks like Goldman Sachs that have more than $50 billion in assets will face higher capital requirements and broader federal oversight. The Clearing House study posed the question in the title of its report, “How much capital is enough?” It said the new rules would decrease return on equity for most American banks by up to 4.9 percentage points. The new requirements have touched off a heated debate in Washington and on Wall Street. Regulators and a number of lawmakers argue that without a capital buffer, the banking industry could once again drive the economy to the brink. But the rules have become the bane of many Wall Street executives, who argue that their firms are already sufficiently capitalized. The debate came to a head earlier this year, when JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, publicly confronted Mr. Bernanke at a conference. Mr. Dimon questioned the Fed chairman about whether “anyone bothered to study the cumulative effect of all these things?”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/business/banks-to-make-customers-pay-debit-card-fee.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Banks to Make Customers Pay Debit Card Fee<date>Published: September 29, 2011</date><text>Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases. It was just one of several new charges expected to hit consumers as new regulations crimp banks’ profits.Wells Fargo and Chase are testing $3 monthly debit card fees. Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to start charging a $4 fee next month, while SunTrust, another regional powerhouse, is charging a $5 fee. The round of new charges stems from a rule, which takes effect on Saturday, that limits the fees that banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer uses a debit card to make a purchase. The rule, known as the Durbin amendment, after its sponsor Senator Richard J. Durbin, is a crucial part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Until now, the fees have been 44 cents a transaction, on average. The Federal Reserve in June agreed to cut the fees to a maximum of about 24 cents. While the fee amounts to pennies per swipe, it rapidly adds up across millions of transactions. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which went into effect in July 2010. And even though retailer groups had argued that lower fees were important to keep prices in check, consumers were not likely to see substantial savings. In fact, they are simply going to end up paying from a different pot of money. Or as Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, put it after passage last year of the Dodd-Frank Act, “If you’re a restaurant and you can’t charge for the soda, you’re going to charge more for the burger.” Chase is now charging customers for a paper statement. It also, like many other banks, scrapped its debit card rewards program. And customers that Chase inherited from Washington Mutual no longer enjoy free checking accounts. The bank is also exploring a number of other fee increases, including for online banking, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Bank of America’s debit fee is steeper than most of its competitors’, reflecting the broader challenges the bank is facing after the financial crisis. The bank has introduced an online-only account that charges customers for doing business at a local branch. It also plans to apply its new debit card fees to anyone who uses the card to make recurring payments like gym fees or cable bills. Citibank is one of the few that said it would not introduce a charge for debit card use. “We have talked to customers and they have made it abundantly clear that ‘if you charge me to use my debit card, I would find that very irritating,’ ” said Stephen Troutner, head of Citi’s banking products. Still, the bank has made it more difficult to qualify for free checking, among other moves. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo estimated that the Durbin rules would cost the bank $250 million in revenue every quarter. It hopes to make up half that gap with a variety of new products and customer fees, including the monthly debit card fee of $3. The change is part of a “pilot program” the bank will begin on Oct. 14 in five states across the country, including Washington and Georgia. As of Saturday, the bank will discontinue its debit card rewards program. Meanwhile, HSBC said that it recently increased an A.T.M. fee — to $2.50 from $2 — for certain customers when they used a competitor’s A.T.M. It also recently introduced a debit transaction fee of 35 cents, though the first eight transactions are free. And at TDBank, customers will now have to pay $2 for using A.T.M.’s outside their network. “Durbin essentially moves the cost of debit away from merchants, and now it’s more focused on consumers,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin. “There are all sort of things happening where banks are saying, where can we put fees in place for our service to generate revenue or how can we reduce our costs?” Over the last few years, consumers have increasingly shifted their spending to debit cards from credit cards, in large part to curb their spending. But some analysts predicted that the new fees could prompt consumers to return to credit cards — a more lucrative alternative for the banks. Consumers have already begun to react to the changes. Patrick Shields, 48, said he had decided to leave Citibank, where he has held a small-business account for his residential window cleaning business since 1986. He was contemplating opening a personal checking account, but realized he could do better at a credit union. “At the credit union, they opened it free of charges, which Citi could not and would not do,” said Mr. Shields, who noted that a personal checking account would have cost more than the one he uses for his New York business. “Now I have both accounts covered, and I am fee-free.” The so-called Durbin rule quickly emerged as one of the thorniest provisions of Dodd-Frank, touching off a long and furious fight in Washington. Wall Street dispatched an army of lobbyists to tame the rule, ultimately yielding mixed results. In June, the Senate defeated a measure that would have delayed the new rule. But just three weeks later, the Federal Reserve decided to cap the fees at 21 to 24 cents for each debit card transaction, a much lighter blow than once expected. In a statement on Thursday, Senator Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said that small businesses would benefit from the new limits. “Swipe fee regulation will still allow banks to cover the actual costs of debit transactions but will rein in the banks’ excessive profit-taking.” Ann Carrns contributed reporting.Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases.

The world’s biggest retailer turned its eyes to a continent where it has little presence: Africa. Wal-Mart announced last fall that it would seek to buy Massmart, its closest counterpart in sub-Saharan Africa, and this year it won approval to buy half of the retailer for $2.4 billion. Special Section Fall 2011 View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section Fall 2011 It is the latest company from the economically stagnant developed world to seek growth in perhaps the last untapped area of international commerce. Corporations and investors alike are raising their bets on so-called frontier markets by buying mines in Zimbabwe, leasing airport stores in Uruguay and acquiring lenders in Sri Lanka. While mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets over all have slowed this year from a robust 2010 — they are down 9 percent from the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data — more and more new markets are being sized up for opportunities by deal makers. “You’ve got high growth rates and relatively large populations that are underserviced,” said Colin Coleman, the head of Goldman Sachs’s sub-Saharan Africa team. “That’s what’s driving a lot of institutional and private equity investments.” The traditional risks, like capricious or corrupt local governments and sudden eruptions of violence, are still present in many places. Billions of dollars’ worth of investments in the Middle East suffered this year as the Arab Spring revolutions swept through Libya, Tunisia and Egypt. “The concept of airtight doesn’t exist in these markets,” said Anthony Armstrong, co-head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse. “You can never control it completely, and you don’t know what you don’t know.” But as many of these countries develop, outside investors are seeking to harness the growth of middle classes. While in developed economies the middle class is well established, populations in these countries are growing wealthier and more sophisticated and are demanding a wider array of luxuries, like cellphones and clothing. That was the thinking of Wal-Mart last year. Having suffered several consecutive quarters of falling same-store sales, the retailer thought again of bolstering its one area of growth, its international operations. Wal-Mart already is in China and South America. To help round out its portfolio, the company looked to Massmart, a retailing giant with stores in 13 sub-Saharan countries. While the bulk of its Marko warehouse stores and Builders Warehouses are in relatively developed South Africa, Massmart also has beachheads in countries like Botswana, Nigeria and Uganda. “South Africa presents a compelling growth opportunity for Wal-Mart and offers a platform for growth and expansion in other African countries,” Andy Bond, Wal-Mart’s top executive for Africa, said at the time of the company’s initial Massmart offer. Bankers, lawyers and consultants that advise companies like Wal-Mart are racing to expand their presence in these regions, with the expectation that they are entering the next Brazil or China. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, opened an affiliate in Dhaka, Bangladesh, last fall. Deal makers say that some countries remain highly risky, including Zimbabwe and Venezuela. But huge pools of resources like oil and minerals are like the sirens’ song to companies and investors. Those types of riches prompted the Essar Group, an Indian conglomerate, to form a natural resources joint venture with the Zimbabwe government. The $750 million deal was meant to revive the ailing Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company, splitting it into a mining company and a steel maker. Yet it requires working with Robert Mugabe, a leader whose takeover of Zimbabwe’s farms a decade ago decimated the country’s economy and drove out foreign investors. Essar was apparently undaunted. “We view this union as a long-term partnership with Zimbabwe and its people,” Ravi Ruia, Essar’s vice chairman, said in a statement after the deal. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Such forays into precarious political climates don’t always end well. African Barrick Gold learned a tough lesson with a gold mine it bought in Tanzania. Local miners have repeatedly tried to steal scraps of gold, leading to bloody conflicts with the company’s security forces and local police officers. In May, five people were killed by police forces when a gang of several hundred people tried to storm the mine with machetes and stones. Local knowledge, experts say, is irreplaceable. Companies and investors often work with governments or other local business specialists before making an entry. The beverage giant SABMiller is among the most active companies in the world when it comes to tapping frontier markets. Having operated in the tumult of South African apartheid, the company was accustomed to operating in uncertain, atypical conditions, from sub-Saharan Africa to Latin America. That has helped shape its philosophy when approaching new acquisitions or business ventures. In 2009, SABMiller executives flew to southern Sudan, which was still healing from civil war, to negotiate the opening of a new plant. But instead of sitting around a conference table signing deeds, the officials followed local custom. They bought a tractor for the community and promised to pay royalties and provide clean water. They also slaughtered a cow. “One can’t just send in a bunch of guys with briefcases to try and do deals,” said Mark Bowman, managing director of SABMiller’s Africa business. “You can’t just buy your way in from the outside. You have to be an insider or know what’s going on to try to create a transaction.” Deciding which countries are worth the risks can be difficult. Many businesses in Venezuela, mostly oil companies, are profitable, but are often forced to reinvest their earnings in the country. And Angola ranks 10th on Transparency International’s 2010 list of the most corrupt countries in the world. But it possesses a significant portion of the continent’s arable uncultivated land. One thing has changed this calculus. Earlier investors often sought to withdraw their investments at the first sign of trouble, but this latest wave of development appears more durable, deal makers say. “There was often a withdrawal of capital from risky places,” said Tihir Sarkar, a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. “But the difference now is that investors have become a bit more sophisticated, and they are more willing to keep money in.” The education of investors has followed recognition of a pattern in frontier markets. The first deals struck are those related to commodities like oil or metals. As countries grow more advanced, consumer goods companies and media and telecommunications concerns are the next to be scooped up. In August, the Swiss retailer Dufry acquired airport store space in five emerging markets for about $1 billion. The deal gave it 21 shops in airports in Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Armenia and Martinique. And Bharti Airtel, the Indian telecommunications giant, bought Zain Africa for $9 billion last year, bolstering its presence in 15 African countries like Gabon and Burkina Faso. With landlines rare and prohibitively expensive to build and maintain in most of sub-Saharan Africa, cellphones have long been seen as an industry with potentially explosive growth prospects. The deal also highlighted another phenomenon: the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China are also hunting for new areas of growth. One class of investors that is also growing is private equity firms. While heavyweights like the Carlyle Group have recently raised Africa-focused funds, many of the longtime players in frontier markets are smaller firms like Helios Capital and Actis. Increasingly, those leading the efforts at these firms are local. They are part of a generation that left their native countries to pursue Ivy League degrees and careers at top Wall Street firms. Helios, for instance, was co-founded by Tope Lawani, a Harvard-educated investor who spent years working at the buyout shop TPG Capital. Helios said earlier this year that it had raised the largest private equity fund ever dedicated to sub-Saharan Africa, about $1 billion.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/chinese-policies-put-squeeze-on-the-banks/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Chinese Policies Put Squeeze On the Banks<date>September 28, 2011, 6:47 pm</date><text>Harry Campbell Globalization has been kind to Wall Street. The opening of European capital markets to American investment banks quickly led to United States financial domination of the Continent and of a large part of the rest of the world. American private equity firms have been equally successful at capturing the global market. But as they say on Wall Street, past performance is no indication of future results. Can Wall Street continue its winning streak? The question boils down to whether it can succeed in Asia, particularly in China. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section - Fall 2011 Investment banks in the United States and in Europe have historically dominated the Asian capital markets, but this dominance has been spotty of late. In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs was the best American performer in the rankings for Chinese debt raised offshore, ranking sixth with a 5.9 percent market share. For all Asian debt offerings, only two United States banks, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, were ranked in the top 10. Still, in other areas, the United States is competing strongly. Dealogic reports that for the first half of 2011, five of the top 10 investment banks underwriting equity in Asia were based in the United States. And Western banks occupy seven of the top 10 slots for providing advice to Asian companies on takeovers. Yet in China, domestic banks held five of the top 10 slots for providing takeover advice on Chinese acquisitions, according to Thomson Reuters. The performance highlights an ominous failure in China. The American banks compete in international offerings with only spotty success. But they don’t compete at all for Chinese companies raising money domestically. According to Dealogic, in the first half of 2011 no American investment banks ranked in the top 10 for locally raised Chinese debt denominated in renminbi. The reason is China’s exclusionary policies. Until this year, China did not allow non-Chinese firms to operate in domestic markets. Previously, American firms were forced to operate through partnerships with domestic Chinese firms. Not surprisingly, these Chinese domestic partners have viewed American banks as merely short-term partners to provide capital and expertise. For example, the China International Capital Corporation, one of China’s biggest investment banks, was formed by a partnership between Morgan Stanley and China Construction Bank. Morgan subsequently grew disenchanted with the relationship as C.I.C.C. grew and Morgan was squeezed out of its day-to-day operations. Morgan sold its stake for $1 billion in 2010. Even with the rule change, American banks remain hobbled in the Chinese domestic market. China recently allowed Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase to form their own mainland ventures, but with the condition that they observe certain operational restrictions, including doing business through a Chinese partner with less than a one-third ownership stake. Morgan Stanley has now established a joint venture with Huaxin Securities to replace its C.I.C.C. relationship. Chinese investment banks are now big enough to compete for international offerings. China’s biggest domestic underwriter of initial public offerings, the Guosen Securities Company, has doubled its staff in Hong Kong in the last year. Guosen, which is controlled by the city of Shenzhen, will compete with American banks for more international offerings by Chinese companies from Hong Kong. Chinese investment banks are entering this new beachhead by hiring staff members trained by the Western investment banks. Guosen Securities, for example, lured Cheng Gang from HSBC Holdings to head its Hong Kong operations. And these domestic banks are being aided by the Chinese government, which often pushes local companies to include Chinese investment banks for its international offerings. Bank of China picked three Chinese banks but only two international banks for its recent $7 billion Hong Kong offering. The Chinese government is thus doing in investment banking what it is doing in other industries. It is strong-arming foreign investment banks to provide capital and expertise as a bridge to building a bigger market share for domestic players. Presumably, the goal is for these Chinese investment banks to compete throughout Asia and globally represent Chinese companies. Underwriting fees in Hong Kong have fallen to as low as 1.9 percent for the recent Prada offering, from a range of 2 to 3.5 percent. One reason is the increased competition among investment banks. Underwriting fees remain at about 6 percent in the United States. Given the obstacles, one would think that American private equity firms might try a different approach in China. Instead, these firms also appear to be striking Faustian bargains, trading their capital and expertise for a Chinese presence. Private equity firms cannot buy whole companies because Chinese regulations largely prohibit such ownership. Instead, the private equity firms have teamed up with local entities for minority stakes or have otherwise bought interests in publicly traded Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong or abroad. These investments, however, have succeeded in part because of the bubbly nature of the Chinese markets. It remains to be seen how these firms will do with these investments if China’s markets slow. Private equity has been rushing to take advantage of this growth by establishing renminbi-denominated funds. Carlyle formed one with the Beijing municipal government. Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also teamed up with local Chinese governments to form these funds. Because the funds are denominated in renminbi and have mostly Chinese investors like municipalities, they have much freer investment rein. The Chinese government is also experimenting with a program to allow limited foreign investment in these funds. It is unlikely, however, that Chinese governments will allow private equity firms to take the kinds of profits they can realize in the United States. For one thing, American private equity firms, like American investment banks, are seeing more competition. According to a recent McKinsey report, local private equity firms occupy 20 percent of the market — double the number from 2007. These Chinese firms are more likely to attract Chinese government investment than are their foreign rivals. The same dynamic at work in investment banking will work in private equity as these local Chinese firms gain experience and hire Western private equity firm employees. Last year, TPG and Goldman Sachs lost senior private equity employees who left to start their own domestic funds. The $300 billion Chinese sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, has bought 10 percent of Blackstone and is earmarking more funds for private equity investment, some of it to be spent abroad. Ultimately, these local private equity firms are likely to rise to advise C.I.C. and other Chinese investors on this foreign investment. It is hard to blame American investment banks and private equity firms, though. They are going for half a loaf rather than nothing at all. While the Chinese financiers are likely to keep elbowing out United States banks in China, it remains to be seen if they can become international bankers in Asia, or, like the Japanese banks, remain local players. One thing appears certain: Wall Street is going to have to fight to preserve its global and Asian position, let alone to grow in places like China. Wall Street will have to be doubly careful it doesn’t give away its business in the headlong sprint into China and Asia, by buying short-term growth in a way that creates long-term global competitors.

Vikram S. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, boldly promised in 2009 that “we will be the single largest emerging markets financial services company.” Goldman Sachs’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at a conference last year that one of his firm’s big goals was “to be Goldman Sachs in more places.” Special Section Fall 2011 View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section Fall 2011 But there’s a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks. “A lot of big banks are looking to developing markets, but historically it’s tended to be a volatile move,” said James Sinegal, a bank analyst at the research firm Morningstar. “It might not be as easy as they expect.” Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. The economies of countries like China, India and Brazil are growing faster than that of the United States. Such places also represent an untapped client base, with a growing middle class and a large number of wealthy individuals. As profits wane on the home front, Wall Street firms are increasingly dependent on the emerging markets to bolster their bottom lines. Citicorp, a division of Citigroup, draws about half of its revenue from emerging countries, up from roughly 25 percent in 2005. International markets account for 47 percent of Goldman’s profits. Morgan Stanley generated nearly a third of its net revenue from outside the Americas. “With the United States slowing down, it is not surprising that institutions are looking in the emerging markets,” said Hamid Biglari, a Citicorp vice chairman and chief of emerging markets. But the perils can be plentiful, with economic, political and regulatory challenges. Foreign regulators have scolded banks, fined them and even banned their activities in various countries. Citigroup twice ran into problems with Japanese authorities. In turn, Wall Street says it has cleaned house at overseas offices, taken greater control of foreign ventures and tapped local bankers to lead new projects. Local knowledge is especially critical, as firms try to navigate the regulatory and political environment that is crucial to a bank’s business. Earlier this year, Citigroup found itself in hot water with Indonesian regulators. After an investigation into suspected embezzlement by an employee and the death of a client after meetings with the bank’s outside debt collectors, the country’s central bank imposed sanctions on Citigroup, including a one-year ban on opening new branches. In June, the bank removed its top country officer, replacing him with a native Indonesian, Tigor M. Siahaan, a seasoned banker experienced in dealing with local regulators and government officials. Now, the bank is tweaking its internal controls, bringing its debt collecting in-house and regularly rotating back-office personnel. The bank said it was also working closely with Indonesian authorities. “How to behave responsibly in these markets comes with experience,” Mr. Biglari said. “You have to figure out how to work with the cultural norms.” Financial firms have also realized that they need to commit to a market, because it can take years if not decades to build up local relationships and understand the country’s customs. While Goldman says on its Web site that it has had a presence in Russia since 1998, the firm has had its troubles in the country. Not long after opening in Russia, Goldman downsized its operations, concerned about the financial crisis that prompted the government to devalue the ruble. It closed the Moscow office and reassigned staff members. Christopher Barter, co-chief executive for Goldman’s Russia business, said the investment bank should not have left the country. “We missed out on years of a footprint there,” he said. “When you go into a country, you have to maintain your commitment.” It took years to build up the business in Russia again. Goldman reopened the Moscow location in 2001, but it didn’t fully ramp up there until 2006, when it obtained a brokerage license. Today, the firm has 140 employees in Russia, up from 30 people five years ago. The company has established stronger ties in the country since it has returned. In 2008, Goldman held a board meeting in Russia, a nod to its re-emergence there. Michael Sherwood, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, now visits Russia several times a year. And Mr. Blankfein, along with other Wall Street chiefs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, has joined a committee set up by the Russian government to help bring more foreign money to the country. Firms have also realized they need more management oversight of overseas investments. Morgan Stanley was one of the first investment banks to establish a joint venture in China. In 1995, it teamed up with China Construction Bank to form the China International Capital Corporation. But the Wall Street bank was a passive investor, owning just one-third of the business, the limit for foreign securities firms under Chinese rules. It also ceded management control to its partners. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold the stake to a group of private equity firms. Since then, Morgan Stanley has forged a new relationship with Huaxin Securities. While it still owns a one-third stake in the venture, called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, it has seats on the firm’s board and plays a role in the day-to-day management of the firm. A Morgan Stanley managing director, Yang Kai, is the chief executive of the company. While foreign business is hardly a guaranteed win, financial firms are willing to take the risks. It’s one of the industry’s few options as banks deal with costly new regulations, sluggish economic growth in their home markets and a volatile market — all of which are weighing on profits. “These guys are hurting and it gets worse by the day,” said Michael J. Driscoll, a professor at Adelphi University’s business school and former senior trader at Bear Stearns. “You can only squeeze so much till you go looking elsewhere for a return.”</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/placing-a-bet-on-brazil/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Placing a Bet on Brazil<date>September 27, 2011, 8:13 pm</date><text>MEXICO CITY — As the United States and Europe face a bleak financial reality, Latin America hums along with continued growth and optimistic predictions for the next few years. View From Latin America Dispatches on the economic landscape. The latest rosy report came Tuesday from J.P. Morgan, which released a survey of 40 institutional investors in North America and Europe, finding them upbeat about investment opportunities in Latin America over the next three years and applauding improvements in investor relations. A majority of these investors, who together hold approximately $57.3 billion of actively managed equity in Latin American companies, view Brazil as the country with the highest investor-relations standards. Mexico, along with Peru, ranked last, partly because of the disparity in investor relations standards between blue-chip companies (which make it easy to find and obtain information for investors and shareholders) and smaller companies (which tend not to be as open with their information). Survey participants named Brazil and Colombia as the most promising countries for investment opportunities over the next three years; Brazil’s rapidly expanding middle class promises to yield tremendous growth, while Colombia’s pro-business government is attractive to investors. Argentina and Venezuela were viewed as the least promising, because of the perception of unstable or unpredictable governments. The economy in Latin America is getting a fair amount of attention as a relative bright spot. A World Bank report published last week attributes the region’s growth to its increasing economic ties to China. Ten years ago, there was almost no commerce between the two; today, China is one of the biggest trading partners for some of the region’s economic powerhouses, including Brazil and Chile. But the commercial honeymoon between China and Latin America may be coming to an end. Francisco J. Sánchez, the United States under secretary of commerce for international trade, visiting Mexico City on Tuesday to promote business, said that high transportation costs, extended delivery times and high import tariffs were reversing this trend. “We are seeing more and more businesses returning to this hemisphere,” Mr. Sánchez said. Investors are taking note.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/business/spinoff-lesson-learned-tyco-treads-carefully.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Spinoff Lesson Learned, Tyco Treads Carefully<date>Published: September 19, 2011</date><text>Shareholders appreciate a good breakup story, and Tyco is giving them more to love. The company, an industrial manufacturing group, divided itself into three parts in 2007. Now one of them, Tyco International, is being carved into three more pieces. The company’s shares gained on Monday amid a broad market sell-off. But while equity investors often see value in a less sprawling conglomerate, the same isn’t always true for bondholders.Corporate debt is often an afterthought in breakups or, worse, a tool to help one unit look better at the expense of another. Tyco knows this. Last time around, an ugly fight with creditors ensued after it tried to buy them out on the cheap, nearly derailing the breakup. This time, the company is paying them more heed. Lenders to other companies haven’t fared as well. Sunoco, for example, retained some $3 billion of investment-grade borrowings when it spun off its coal mining subsidiary. Now, the debt is rated junk and the company is scrambling to get out of the refining business. Meanwhile at Dynegy, creditors are in a pitched battle with the activist investor Carl Icahn over a split of sorts. The company transferred assets away from the holding company and, more important, out of the reach of bondholders should Dynegy ever stumble into bankruptcy — something management warned was a real danger before Mr. Icahn acquired a significant minority stake. Tyco seems to have learned a lesson. The company alienated debt investors four years ago. This time, by promising to redistribute $4 billion of borrowings relatively fairly among the residential alarms, pipeline widgets and fire and security units to retain their investment-grade status, Tyco seems to be going out of its way to keep bondholders on its side. Investors in other conglomerates may not be so lucky. Over 60 companies have announced spinoffs this year and more seem destined to come. Weak debt covenants held over from the boom and from more recent issues mean bondholders should be mindful of their vulnerability amid breakup fever. Tyco’s creditors got a second chance. Others may not. Voodoo Merger Math The numbers just aren’t adding up on Wall Street. To support the merger ambitions of their clients, investment bankers routinely claim the sum of a deal will be greater than its parts. Yet in the three years or so since JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns, Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch and Barclays bought the American arm of Lehman Brothers, each firm has shed, not gained, market share. These results undermine Wall Street’s deal math. Though the 2008 deal was originally intended as a rescue of Merrill, Bank of America can comfort itself with the knowledge that Merrill has propped up the bank’s results through its mortgage crisis. Barclays, meanwhile, has solidified a role in the United States by plucking Lehman out of bankruptcy. And Bear Stearns fortified JPMorgan’s prime brokerage business, which provides services to hedge funds. But in dispensing advice to corporate clients, the deals have disappointed. At the end of 2007, Lehman sat in third place in United States merger league tables, with a little over 9 percent market share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Barclays, which had virtually no M.&amp; A. presence in the United States at the time, has less than 6 percent share so far in 2011. On a global basis, Bank of America and Merrill commanded 8 percent between them before they merged. Together, the entity clocks just 6 percent today. JPMorgan and Bear boasted more than 9 percent when separate, but JPMorgan’s share is now just 8 percent. Market forces and strategic decisions explain some of this. Boutiques, and some large rivals, capitalized on the disarray. Bank of America struggled to keep senior Merrill bankers, especially in Europe. Much of Lehman’s merger success was structured around leveraged buyouts, a business yet to recover. And JPMorgan’s investment banking head count dwindled by more than the number added with Bear within two years of the deal. The mergers fell short of their potential in other ways. In stock and debt underwriting, none of the combined firms has gained business, and in some cases they’ve lost significant market share. That doesn’t mean Bank of America, Barclays and JPMorgan will regret doing these deals. Their clients, however, should keep the outcomes in mind the next time they are presented with a pitch book professing that one and one make three. AGNES T.

In a bellwether for other large financial firms, JPMorgan Chase warned that third-quarter trading revenue was likely to fall about 8 percent from a year ago. Investment banking income is also expected to drop by one-third from a year earlier, as corporations get cold feet about acquisitions as well as stock and debt offerings. “I think you can safely expect a decline in our markets revenue,” Jes Staley, the head of JPMorgan’s investment bank, said in remarks at the Barclays financial services conference on Tuesday. There are still 13 trading days left in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, and Wall Street firms will not release their final numbers until the middle of next month. But a sharp fall-off in summer trading seems poised to weigh heavily on the banks’ earnings — and perhaps accelerate another round of layoffs expected in the coming months. After helping lift Wall Street’s results during the financial crisis, trading revenue is projected to fall for a second straight quarter. On average, it is expected to be down by about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also expected to have weak third-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the latest bad news as shares of the biggest banks rose slightly on Tuesday in relatively calm trading. But bank stocks have been pummeled recently. The KBW index, a widely cited gauge of the banking sector, has fallen more than 28 percent since January. Although Wall Street firms can land windfalls making speculative bets with the banks’ own capital, the bulk of their trading revenue comes from transactions made on behalf of clients. But with the heightened volatility over the summer, many companies and investors remained on the sidelines — causing a significant slowdown in trading activity. The lackluster trading results come at a bad time for the industry, when profits and revenues have slipped to the levels attained before the housing boom. Many are bracing for a slowdown in lending, as consumers grow nervous about their job prospects and businesses put off expansion plans. Banks still face an endless stream of legal headaches and litigation fees from the foreclosure mess. In addition, new regulation has ratcheted up compliance costs and caused once-lucrative income streams, like debit card swipe fees and overdraft charges, to vanish. And all that is not counting the impact of the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates low for the next two years — a move that will erode lending profit margins in the months ahead. In anticipation of leaner times ahead, banks are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations. On Monday, Bank of America announced plans to cut about 30,000 jobs across the company, or nearly 10 percent of its work force. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS are among the major Wall Street firms that have started laying off employees in the last few months. JPMorgan’s investment bank is more than halfway through a five-year plan to save about $1.3 billion a year by consolidating its trading operations — a move that will involve shedding as many as 3,000 workers, some of whom will be employed elsewhere in the bank. But so far, Mr. Staley said the bank does not anticipate a major round of layoffs beyond those previously announced. “We have had a very good first half of the year,” he said at a banking conference in Frankfurt last week. “We will see how this plays out.” Still, the numbers at JPMorgan may foreshadow more pain ahead. JPMorgan was among the first major banks to sound the alarm bells over souring subprime mortgage loans in early 2007. In 2008, the bank flagged concerns about ballooning losses on its large portfolio of home equity loans ahead of many competitors and has moved quickly to shore up its reserves against legal claims stemming from the mortgage mess. In his remarks, Mr. Staley said investors could expect equity and fixed income trading revenues to decline about 30 percent from the second quarter, putting them at about $3.85 billion. Investment banking fees are expected to fall to about $1 billion, down from $1.9 billion in the second quarter. He also said that the bank’s private equity business would face a “moderate loss” of about $100 million and that its asset management business would see trading-related declines. Other banks may see a similar fall-off in trading. Citigroup, which has a giant fixed-income business, could see core trading revenue drop 47 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Overall trading revenue at Morgan Stanley is expected to fall about 1 percent from a year earlier, while revenue at Bank of America is expected to rise about 11 percent. Both banks had relatively weak third-quarter results in 2010. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs’s trading income is expected to fall about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse. But that may not represent the full extent of the declines it can expect. Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote in a recent report that the bank could face more than $3.2 billion in losses tied to its investment and lending businesses, which include private equity and other investments made with the bank’s own capital. That is because it must adjust its accounting to reflect the market’s recent round of wild swings.The worries of Wall Street banks keep growing.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/nyregion/jpmorgan-chase-got-us-help-but-mortgage-holders-did-not.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Chase Got U.S. Help, but Mortgage Holders Did Not<date>Published: September 12, 2011</date><text>For those who live in the alternate universe that is New York outside of Manhattan, brownstone Brooklyn and assorted upper-income offshoots, Mimi Pierre Johnson’s story is depressingly familiar.She and her husband bought their four-bedroom home in Elmont, on Long Island, for $413,000 in 2005. Then the recession blew in. Her husband lost his construction job, her real estate work slowed and their boiler wheezed and died. Their once-reasonable mortgage resembled a forbidding mountain. She dialed her bank, JPMorgan Chase, seeking a lifeline. The bank gave her a temporary modification, but then canceled it. It lost her documents. It did not return her calls. Late fees and lawyer bills piled up. “I’m a Realtor; I know I’m doomed,” Ms. Johnson said. “But I want to say to Chase, ‘Hello!? The government gave you a bailout to help people like me.’ ” Here, Ms. Johnson is mistaken. Presidents George W. Bush and Obama spent more than $1 trillion in taxpayer money to bail out our largest banks and corporations. But they exacted no quid pro quo. JPMorgan Chase has recorded splendid profits and has no obligation to bail out hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing dispossession. Instead, the battle to hold JPMorgan Chase — and its brothers in government-supported finance — accountable has fallen to state and city officials. Some in New York sound eager for a rumble (the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has taken a tough line, seeking piles of documents from banks, including JPMorgan Chase). Pitchforks, too, are raised by movements like the one that Ms. Johnson has enlisted in, New York Communities for Change. Run by the reconstituted remnants of Acorn (a community organizing group laid low by conservative dirty tricksters and its own missteps), the group has joined with unions to lobby towns and cities to close accounts with Chase, unless the bank begins to write down mortgages. This campaign has a mouse-that-roared quality. The villages of Hempstead and Freeport withdrew millions of dollars. Ithaca barred the bank from bond offerings. JPMorgan Chase measures its assets in trillions. This is no threat. Yet bank officials are quick to jump on the telephone. When the floods of Tropical Storm Irene recede, Binghamton, a city of almost 50,000, is expected to vote to withdraw tens of millions of dollars from Chase. In other words, a toothache could get worse. JPMorgan Chase officials offer an indignant defense. Mistakes were made, but they were not the worst offenders. Push housing advocates, and they concede this point. Wells Fargo and Bank of America — which announced 30,000 layoffs on Monday — are horses running neck and neck with Chase. But Joseph Sanders of Staten Island Legal Services would make a poor character witness. “I can’t honestly say Chase is head and shoulders worse,” he said. “They are just right near the top of a clueless group.” The Obama administration runs a mortgage relief program that has fallen vastly short of its goals. Treasury officials finally have stiffened, grading banks and withholding incentive payments. In the last quarter, two truants sat in the worst category: JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Chase officials offer careful throat-clearing. “We continue to make significant improvements to our processes and controls,” said Thomas A. Kelly, a company spokesman. “We expect future scorecards will reflect that.” Mr. Schneiderman has refused to sign off on an agreement that would exempt banks from prosecution in exchange for $20 billion in mortgage relief. (The nation’s 49 other attorneys general recently tossed Mr. Schneiderman off their executive committee.) But New York City officials, who control tens of millions of dollars in bank accounts and lucrative bonding businesses, have tossed rose petals at JPMorgan Chase. Their view is that banks are to New York what the auto industry was to Detroit. The city comptroller, John C. Liu, recently pushed the city’s Banking Commission to require banks to disclose mortgage modifications and foreclosures, with breakdowns by economic class. Mayoral appointees on the commission rejected the idea. Ms. Johnson lives just east of the city line. Not long ago, she flew to Florida to tend to her critically ill mother. She missed her final modification payment by a few days, and the bank canceled it. She begged. “They told me, ‘Mrs. Johnson, if we did it for you, we’d have to do it for thousands of people.’ ” Which, after all, is the point.

Gruenberg, the acting chairman of the F.D.I.C. Nearly three years to the day that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Wall Street teetered on the brink, federal regulators are seeking to wipe out the infamous phenomenon that Wall Street is too big to fail. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation unanimously approved two sets of rules on Tuesday that would mandate so-called living wills at the nation’s largest financial firms, a crucial step in enforcing the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis. One new rule will force huge bank holding companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase — along with other sprawling corporations that present a systemic risk to the economy — to spell out plans for unwinding their business through bankruptcy should they once again fall on hard times. Under a separate rule adopted on Tuesday, the F.D.I.C. will require the depository arm at the nation’s 37 largest banks, those housing more than $50 billion in total assets, to create their own contingency plans. The so-called resolution proposal would allow the F.D.I.C., acting as receiver, to dismantle the banks outside the bankruptcy process. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links F.D.I.C. statement on first rule F.D.I.C. statement on second rule “These two rules will ensure the comprehensive and coordinated resolution planning for both the insured depository and its holding company and affiliates in the event that an orderly liquidation is required,” the F.D.I.C.’s acting chairman, Martin J. Gruenberg, said in a statement. The Federal Reserve must now bless the living will plan for it to become official, a move that is expected to come as soon as this week. The rules underscore the changing regulatory landscape unfolding since the financial crisis, when Washington enacted a $700 billion bailout for banks, the automotive industry and the giant insurer American International Group. At the time, the Bush and Obama administrations said they had no choice but to rescue the firms. After all, they were so large and interconnected that their collapse would have further imperiled the nation’s already fragile economy. But under the F.D.I.C.’s new living will plan, big financial firms must provide a road map of their business to regulators, who can then keep an eye on Wall Street’s health. The documents will open a window into the financial industry’s investments, trading counterparties and concentration of risk. The firms also must share what amounts to a Plan B — details for how the company can be wound down through the bankruptcy process. Under pressure from the industry, regulators agreed to phase in the due dates for firms to submit the living wills. The largest banks and financial firms, those with more than $250 billion in assets, are the first in line to file their paperwork. Armed with the contingency plans, regulators say they can prevent a repeat of the chaotic Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, which still lingers on today. “It’s a preventative tool,” said Thomas P. Vartanian, a former regulator who is now a partner at the law firm Dechert. “This will help the regulators be more nimble.” Mr. Vartanian cautioned, however, that detecting the next financial crisis was no sure bet. “The question at the end of the day is will this help at the margin or will it change the whole picture,” he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/banks-brace-for-a-season-of-fall-offs/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Banks Brace for a Season of Fall-Offs<date>September 13, 2011, 8:50 pm</date><text>In a bellwether for other large financial firms, JPMorgan Chase warned that third-quarter trading revenue was likely to fall about 8 percent from a year ago, The New York Times reports.

Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The report On Monday, the government-appointed Independent Commission on Banking called for banks to separate their deposit-taking operations from investment banking services, stopping short of completely breaking up the firms. The panel plans to give banks until 2019 to adapt to new rules intended to make the financial sector more stable, saying an “extended implementation period would be appropriate.” George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said the commission, led by a former Bank of England chief economist, John Vickers, “has done an excellent job.” “John Vickers himself has set out a timetable and I intend to stick to that timetable,” Mr. Osborne said. Leon Neal/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJohn Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist, headed a 14-month review of British banks. Jon Pain, a partner at KPMG, called the proposals “game changing” and said they were “a return to a more simple 1940s and ’50s style of retail banking where it is perceived as more of a basic utility.” The proposals, which go beyond banking reforms in the United States and elsewhere, are expected to lead to extensive lobbying from the banks before any final decisions on new rules are made by the British government. Under the proposal, British banks would have to separate their businesses taking deposits and lending to consumers and businesses from groups involved in stocks, derivatives and equity and debt underwriting. The two subsidiaries would be separately capitalized, have different boards, different cultures and report results as if they were two different companies, the commission report said. Capital from the investment banking unit could be injected into the retail bank if needed, and the two businesses could share customers and expertise, the commission said. Some banking executives have argued that the changes would hurt investors, the economy and industry competitions. Banks with large investment banking operations, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, may be most affected by the new rules, some analysts have said. The separation could drive up their funding costs if investors and lenders perceived them as riskier. Spokesmen for the two banks declined to comment. British banking stocks fell on Monday, with Barclays down 1.6 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland more than 3 percent, as markets were unnerved by the nagging prospect of a Greek default. But the commission has argued that the benefits — particularly a healthier banking industry with less probability of government bailouts — would outweigh the short-term costs. “Retail subsidiaries would be legally, economically and operationally separate from the rest of the banking groups to which they belonged,” the commission said in its 360-page report. “The improved stability that structural reform would bring to the U.K. economy would be positive for investment both in financial services and the wider economy.” The 2019 deadline is about four years later than some analysts had expected; the new rules would be adopted after the next general election. Prime Minister David Cameron has grown increasingly nervous that making major changes now could harm an already weak economic recovery, two government officials said last week. They declined to be identified because no final decision had been made. Mr. Vickers warned the government that scrapping parts of the proposals or changing them in favor of the banks would be “a great mistake.” “The too-big-to-fail problem must not be recast as a too-delicate-to-reform problem,” Mr. Vickers said. “More stress for banks” this year because of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis “underlines that the status quo is not an option,” he said. “Things will need to change.” Ed Balls, the opposition Labor Party’s candidate for the treasury position, said the commission put forward “a tough and radical proposal” and that “the stalled recovery is not an excuse for ducking reform.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/model-says-nein-to-jpmorgan-job-offer/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Model Turns Down JPMorgan Job Offer<date>September 12, 2011, 12:55 pm</date><text>Xenia Tchoumitcheva, the former Miss Switzerland runner-up, has turned down a job offer at JPMorgan Chase after having interned at the firm’s London office, according to the German-languate site blick.ch.

David’s firm, Blue Heron Research Partners, does research for investment professionals; he was writing to share his frustration in trying to build a business in the aftermath of the recession.“Like many small businesses,” he wrote, “we were socked by the recession. Rather than cut back, however, we chose to be aggressive.” He and his wife, Marcia, invested everything they had in the firm. They refused to lay off their three employees. During an especially bad stretch, they used their credit cards to stay afloat. Their risk-taking paid off. “We’re hiring again,” David’s note continued. (Indeed, he’s now got a full-time staff of nine.) “Business is strong. Our receivables are unbelievable. We have long-term contracts with established investors.” His problem was — and is — the same one facing millions of small businesspeople.  With lending standards extraordinarily tight in the wake of the financial crisis, banks simply aren’t making small business loans, not even to perfectly creditworthy people like David.  Which means he can’t expand — and hire — the way he would like to.  Yes, he said, he could continue to plow his cash flow into the business and grow it slowly.  But to get the firm to the next plateau, he needs a bank loan. “Banks say they have credit to offer,” he wrote. “And they make you go through all the motions. But then they offer nothing.” He tried three times to wrest a paltry $50,000 from two different banks, including JPMorgan Chase, which the firm uses for its own banking needs. He showed the loan officers Blue Heron’s receivables and its long-term contracts. It didn’t matter. He was turned down all three times. No collateral, said JPMorgan. Lack of a relationship, said the other bank. As it happens, around the same time I was hearing from David, a small businessman on the West Coast was sending me very similar e-mails. His name is Bill Schultheis, and he was trying to help his wife start an upscale spa in Bellevue, Wash. He and his wife, Zhiqin Zhang, were looking for $500,000. “My wife moved here from China 13 years ago,” Bill wrote. She had already built and sold two spas; now she wanted to create something bigger and more luxurious. If all went according to plan, wrote Bill, she would employ between 25 and 35 people — “something Obama would appreciate,” he added with a touch of sarcasm. Bill sent me the business plan for the new spa. It was impressive. He outlined Zhiqin’s track record. He explained that the cash flow from his day job — he’s an investment manager — could pay off the loan within 18 months. And then he sent me a chronology of his failed efforts, going back to April 2010, to land a loan that would allow Zhiqin to follow her entrepreneurial dream. Wells Fargo. Cathay Bank. KeyBank. Columbia Bank. In all, 14 banks turned down Bill and his wife. Lack of collateral was invariably the reason. “Banks tell us to get lost when we come knocking on the door, even though we are putting up 60 percent on a $1.3 million project, which is halfway complete,” Bill wrote in early August.  A few weeks later, however, Bill sent me another, very different e-mail: Bill and Zhiqin were going to get their loan after all. A local institution, Sterling Savings Bank, based in Spokane, Wash., had said yes — much to their amazement and delight. Why had Sterling been willing to overlook the lack of collateral, which had a been a deal-breaker for every other institution? Because, as one of its executives, Robert Weisel, explained to me, making sensible loans to small businesspeople was how Sterling competed for business — even when the loan applicants didn’t meet “the traditional standard,” as he put it. “We are linked to our region and our community,” he said. ‘We try to distinguish ourselves by trying to figure out how to make transactions work, even if it means being willing to think outside the box.” In this case, Bill’s cash flow and Zhiqin’s track record more than made up for the lack of collateral. On Thursday night, President Obama offered up a series of tax breaks to small businesses as part of his jobs package. “Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin,” he told Congress. I don’t mean to diminish the tax relief, which may, indeed, encourage small businesses to start hiring. But, far more than tax relief, small businesses need credit. That is what the president should be pushing for. Three years ago, the federal government used tens of billions in taxpayer dollars to save the banking system. Now, at this dire economic moment, the country needs the banks to return the favor. Pushing the country’s banks to act more like Sterling Savings Bank, and less like JPMorgan Chase, is something that the president might want to put on his jobs agenda.Not long ago, I received an e-mail from David Rynecki, an old friend and former colleague who left journalism a half-dozen years ago to become a small businessman.

Women — always a rare breed in the upper echelons of Wall Street — are looking like an endangered species in the executive suite of big banks. On Tuesday, Bank of America reshuffled its management team, culling Sallie Krawcheck from its ranks. With her departure, a handful of women will still report directly to the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, but they largely fill top roles in groups that don’t produce revenue. Among them: Anne Finucane, the global strategy and marketing officer; Christine Katziff, the corporate general auditor; Andrea Smith, the head of human resources; and Cathy Bessant, the head of global technology and operations. It is a long-running theme across Wall Street, with the plum spots in investment banking and brokerages most typically held by men. At Goldman Sachs, women make up little more than 12 percent of the partnership, an elite group that includes the firm’s most senior executives and biggest stars.

Erin Callan, the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers, got the boot just months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Zoe Cruz, the co-president of Morgan Stanley, was ousted in a management shake-up in late 2007. Terri Dial lasted just a year as chief executive of Citigroup’s consumer business in North America. And Heidi Miller, the head of JPMorgan Chase’s international efforts who was once viewed as a potential successor to the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is set to depart the company early next year. That is not to say women do not hold some pretty powerful positions in finance. Earlier this year, the private equity firm Carlyle Group, which just filed to go public, tapped Adena T. Friedman as its chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Ina Drew, the bank’s chief investment officer, sits on the operating committee.

Investors fled financial shares Friday amid growing concern that the litigation could last for years and undermine earnings and balance sheets in the process. The complaints were filed just as the stock market closed Friday afternoon, but with word leaking out of the impending legal action during the trading session, shares of Bank of America fell more than 8.3 percent, while JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.6 percent and Goldman fell 4.5 percent. “The suits only add to the uncertainty that dogs the industry,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole. “Banks should pay for what they did wrong, but at the same time they shouldn’t be treated as a big piñata that has the effect of delaying the housing recovery. If banks have to pay for loans they made five years ago, are they going to make new ones?” After the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, years of litigation followed. The mortgage bust and the subsequent financial crisis have spawned a similar legal fight, said Jaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst with MF Global in Washington. “It’s going to be exceedingly difficult and take years to play out,” he said. “There’s not much incentive for either side to settle.” The litigation represents a more intense effort by the federal government to go after the financial services industry for its supposed mortgage failures. Indeed, the cases were brought on the basis of 64 subpoenas issued a year ago, giving the government an edge in its investigation that private investors suing the banks lack. The Obama administration as well as regulators like the Federal Reserve have been criticized for going too easy on the banks, which benefited from a $700 billion bailout package shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn 2008. Much of that money has been repaid by the banks — but the rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie has already cost taxpayers $153 billion, and the federal government estimates the effort could cost $363 billion through 2013. Even though the banks already face high legal bills from actions brought by other plaintiffs, including private investors, the suits filed Friday could cost the banks far more. In the case against Bank of America, for example, the suit claims that Fannie and Freddie bought more than $57 billion worth of risky mortgage securities from the bank and two companies it also acquired, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial. In addition to suing the companies, the complaints also identified individuals at many institutions responsible for the machinery of turning subprime mortgages into securities that somehow earned a AAA grade from the rating agencies. The filing did not cite a figure for the total losses the government wanted to recover, but in a similar case brought in July against UBS, the F.H.F.A. is trying to recover $900 million in losses on $4.5 billion in securities. A similar 20 percent claim against Bank of America could equal a $10 billion hit. In a suit that identifies 23 securities that Bank of America sold for $6 billion, the company “caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an amount to be determined at trial.” Within minutes of the filing of the suits, several banks responded with a preview of the legal arguments they will make in the coming months, namely that Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated investors who should have known the securities were not without risk, and that the losses were caused not by fraud or misrepresentation but by underlying difficulties in the housing market. In a statement, Bank of America said Fannie and Freddie “claimed to understand the risks inherent in investing in subprime securities and continued to invest heavily in those securities even after their regulator told them they did not have the risk management capabilities to do so.” In spite of that warning, Bank of America said, the government-controlled mortgage giants “are now seeking to hold other market participants responsible for their losses.” Other large banks also assembled huge amounts of so-called private label mortgage-backed securities for Fannie and Freddie that declined sharply in value after the housing bubble burst in 2007. JPMorgan Chase sold $33 billion, while Morgan Stanley sold over $10 billion and Goldman Sachs sold more than $11 billion. A who’s who of foreign banks were also big bundlers and sellers of these securities, like Deutsche Bank with $14.2 billion, Royal Bank of Scotland at $30.4 billion, and Credit Suisse selling $14.1 billion. All were sued Friday. “We believe the claims brought by the F.H.F.A. are unfounded,” said Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank. “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated investor, having issued trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and purchased hundreds of billions of dollars more, often after hand-picking the loans they now claim should not have been included in the offerings.“ Buried in the filings themselves, however, is a damning portrait of the excesses of the housing bubble, when borrowers were able to obtain home loans without basic proof of income or creditworthiness, and banks appeared only too happy to mine profits taking the risky loans and assembling them into securities that could be sold to investors. In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, for example, the suit says that “Goldman was not content to simply let poor loans pass into its securitizations.” In addition, the giant investment bank “took the fraud further, affirmatively seeking to profit from this knowledge.” When an outside analytics firm, Clayton, identified potential problems in the underlying mortgages Goldman was turning into securities, the suit said, “Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red flags revealed by Clayton’s review.” Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Citigroup. Similar behavior in terms of warnings provided by Clayton transpired at Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, RBS and UBS, according to the complaints.

The suits stem from subpoenas the finance agency issued to banks a year ago. If the case is not filed Friday, they said, it will come Tuesday, shortly before a deadline expires for the housing agency to file claims. The suits will argue the banks, which assembled the mortgages and marketed them as securities to investors, failed to perform the due diligence required under securities law and missed evidence that borrowers’ incomes were inflated or falsified. When many borrowers were unable to pay their mortgages, the securities backed by the mortgages quickly lost value. Fannie and Freddie lost more than $30 billion, in part as a result of the deals, losses that were borne mostly by taxpayers. In July, the agency filed suit against UBS, another major mortgage securitizer, seeking to recover at least $900 million, and the individuals with knowledge of the case said the new litigation would be similar in scope. Private holders of mortgage securities are already trying to force the big banks to buy back tens of billions in soured mortgage-backed bonds, but this federal effort is a new chapter in a huge legal fight that has alarmed investors in bank shares. In this case, rather than demanding that the banks buy back the original loans, the finance agency is seeking reimbursement for losses on the securities held by Fannie and Freddie. The impending litigation underscores how almost exactly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of a financial crisis caused in large part by subprime lending, the legal fallout is mounting. Besides the angry investors, 50 state attorneys general are in the final stages of negotiating a settlement to address abuses by the largest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The attorneys general, as well as federal officials, are pressing the banks to pay at least $20 billion in that case, with much of the money earmarked to reduce mortgages of homeowners facing foreclosure. And last month, the insurance giant American International Group filed a $10 billion suit against Bank of America, accusing the bank and its Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units of misrepresenting the quality of mortgages that backed the securities A.I.G. bought. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan all declined to comment. Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said, “We can’t comment on a suit that we haven’t seen and hasn’t been filed yet.” But privately, financial service industry executives argue that the losses on the mortgage-backed securities were caused by a broader downturn in the economy and the housing market, not by how the mortgages were originated or packaged into securities. In addition, they contend that investors like A.I.G. as well as Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated and knew the securities were not without risk. Investors fear that if banks are forced to pay out billions of dollars for mortgages that later defaulted, it could sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across the financial services industry, which has only recently regained its footing. Bank officials also counter that further legal attacks on them will only delay the recovery in the housing market, which remains moribund, hurting the broader economy. Other experts warned that a series of adverse settlements costing the banks billions raises other risks, even if suits have legal merit. The housing finance agency was created in 2008 and assigned to oversee the hemorrhaging government-backed mortgage companies, a process known as conservatorship. “While I believe that F.H.F.A. is acting responsibly in its role as conservator, I am afraid that we risk pushing these guys off of a cliff and we’re going to have to bail out the banks again,” said Tim Rood, who worked at Fannie Mae until 2006 and is now a partner at the Collingwood Group, which advises banks and servicers on housing-related issues. 1 2 Next Page »The federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is set to file suits against more than a dozen big banks, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities they assembled and sold at the height of the housing bubble, and seeking billions of dollars in compensation.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/u-s-is-expected-to-sue-big-banks-over-mortgages/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">U.S. Is Expected to Sue Big Banks Over Mortgages<date>September 2, 2011, 7:16 am</date><text>The Federal Housing Finance Agency lawsuits, which are expected to be filed in the coming days in federal court, are aimed at Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, among others, The New York Times reports.

The card comes with a number of perks, including the ability to waive additional insurance when renting a car. Because I like to deal in minutiae, I was looking over the fine print of the enclosed guide to benefits. Scanning the page, my eyes settled on words that had no business being in the agate boilerplate of a cardmember’s agreement: Bricklin. DeLorean. I’m sorry, what? I went back to read the whole paragraph. “Examples of excluded expensive, exotic, and antique automobiles are the Aston Martin, Bentley, Bricklin, Daimler, DeLorean, Excalibur, Ferrari, Jensen, Lamborghini, Lotus, Maserati, Porsche, and Rolls Royce.” Bricklin? DeLorean? Excalibur? Jensen? I’m glad to know that the legal writers of 1986 were so up on the fancy models of the day. And this is useful information to have: The next time I’m at the Hertz counter, I’ll be sure to wave off that Jensen Interceptor they’re offering.

As people and businesses assess the damage left in Hurricane Irene‘s wake, some banks are trying to help. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase told its customers that it would waive A.T.M. fees through Sept. 4 for those in hurricane-affected areas. In an e-mail to customers, the bank said it would not charge fees related to overdraft, the use of non-Chase A.T.M.’s, late payments on credit cards and loans and early withdrawal on certificates of deposit. In addition, the bank will extend branch hours and increase the number of employees at branches “in severely affected areas.” A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Kristin Lemkau, said that branch employees were instructed to reach out to local businesses and use their “good judgment” in helping consumers secure loans at flexible terms. “We’ve given them the green light to act on the spot,” Ms. Lemkau said. “They can accelerate the loan approval process and give favorable financing terms when they can.” Employees who can travel safely are expected to report to work on Monday, but JPMorgan has made “backup childcare” services available.

Capital One, which has more than 1,000 branches in the region, said it was willing to work with customers to grant interest rate reductions and fee waivers, depending on their situations. In a statement to DealBook, Bank of America said it was actively working with customers “to help them with their specific needs.” The company expects “minimal” disruptions to its operations and plans to deploy mobile A.T.M. units to affected areas as necessary. On Monday, Wells Fargo announced it will suspend fees associated with using non-Wells Fargo A.T.M.s and for early withdrawals on C.D.s, through Sept. 2. A representative for PNC Financial Services said the firm was still reviewing the impact of the storm and its options. Their actions come as the banks themselves grapple with the fallout of Hurricane Irene. Although the storm slowed down as it pushed through the Northeast corridor on Sunday, it still damaged power lines and caused severe flooding in certain regions. As of Monday morning, JPMorgan reported 103 branches without power, about 10 percent of its presence in the greater New York area. About 30 locations reported flooding or physical damage to the building. PNC said 55 branches were still without power. At the height of the storm, about 200 were affected. While 25 are expected to get power on Monday, at least one branch, its location in New Hope, Penn., is still inaccessible because of flooding.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/as-irene-approaches-banks-prepare-for-the-worst/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">As Irene Approaches, Banks Prepare for the Worst<date>August 26, 2011, 12:58 pm</date><text>  5:37 p.m. | Updated As Hurricane Irene travels up the East Coast, New York is steeling itself for potential disaster. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the state on Thursday, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has urged city residents of low-lying areas to evacuate their homes by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Wall Street, too, is entering the bunker. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Interactive Feature: Hurricane Irene Tracking Map Many of New York’s largest investment banks have their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, and thus fall outside the city’s designated flood zones. Bank of America‘s 1 Bryant Park skyscraper, Citigroup‘s 399 Park Avenue building, Morgan Stanley‘s 1585 Broadway bureau, and JPMorgan Chase‘s 270 Park Avenue offices are all outside the zones. Credit Suisse‘s tower, located a little further south at 11 Madison Avenue, also carries a “no zone” designation. But the headquarters of Goldman Sachs, located at 200 West Street in Battery Park City, is located in Zone A, the low-lying area that the mayor has ordered to be evacuated. So is American Express‘s office in the World Financial Center. Deutsche Bank‘s 60 Wall Street headquarters, several blocks away from Goldman, is in Zone B. A Goldman spokesman declined to detail the bank’s hurricane preparations, but said that the bank had “plans in place to ensure the safety of our people and the ongoing operation of our business.” A Deutsche Bank spokesman said in a statement: “We are monitoring the storm closely and keeping employees informed with regular updates. We have already taken steps to ensure that we can conduct business as usual while maintaining the safety of all our employees, which is of utmost importance.” Some Midtown banks have second offices in high-risk zones. The Tribeca office of Citigroup, located near the Hudson River at 388 Greenwich Street, is in Zone A, as is Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, also in the World Financial Center. Citigroup’s Tribeca office houses its investment bank and trading floor. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management employees and other tenants of the World Financial Center were sent instructions for a “controlled lockdown” on Friday, but a spokeswoman for Brookfield, the building’s manager, said the lockdown protocol had been superseded by Mayor Bloomberg’s evacuation order. Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said that the bank had off-site offices in undisclosed locations available in the case that employees are unable to get to their normal locations. “Citi is committed to providing uninterrupted service to our clients during the storm and seeks to minimize any possible impact,” she said. Goldman Sachs, normally a bastion of conservative fashion, has told employees in some divisions they can dress casually on Monday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a memo, the firm instructed employees to “exercise good judgment” when determining proper dress. Some banks have begun booking hotel rooms for critical employees who may not otherwise be able to make it in to Manhattan, and a professional golf tournament sponsored by Barclays, which was scheduled to finish on Sunday, was shortened to 54 holes from 72 holes because of the impending storm. Chase announced that it would keep its 376 New York City branches open until 8 PM on Friday, to give customers ample time to complete banking transactions before the storm. It said the branches would be open until 11 a.m. on Saturday. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is located at 33 Liberty Street, said, “We are monitoring the storm and have contingency plans in place and multiple levels of redundancies to ensure regular operational functioning.” A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, John Nester, said: “We have been communicating throughout the day with markets and securities firms on whether the markets will be open Monday. Discussions will continue Saturday and Sunday as appropriate. The markets will make the decision whether to open in consultation with the S.E.C.” The New York Stock Exchange, which at 11 Wall Street is located in Zone C, is “planning to open on Monday,” a spokesman said, though it has a number of options if the storm makes that impossible, such as routing trades to its electronic market.

The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a news release that JPMorgan processed wire transfers totaling around $178.5 million for Cuban nationals in late 2005 and early 2006, violating United States embargo laws. The bank’s officers discovered the transfers in 2005, after they were tipped off by another financial institution, but failed to report them and did not take adequate steps to prevent more transfers, according to the statement. The release did not say which institution made the initial discovery. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The bank was also fined for a 2009 incident in which it made a $2.9 million loan to a bank that had ties to Iran’s government-owned shipping line, a violation of United States sanctions against the Middle Eastern nation. Again, JPMorgan Chase learned of the apparent violation early on but did not disclose it to regulators until March 2010, three days before it was repaid for the loan. A third violation occurred in 2010 and 2011, when the bank failed to give up documents about a wire transfer that referred to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. According to the release, the agency gave JPMorgan a list of documents believed to be possessed by JPMorgan. In response, JPMorgan, which previously said it had no such documents, produced more than 20 of the items in question. Treasury officials called the bank’s actions “egregious” and said that JPMorgan’s “managers and supervisors acted with knowledge of the conduct constituting the apparent violations and recklessly failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution or care.” JPMorgan said that it never dealt directly with institutions in the embargoed countries and that it had merely acted as a middleman. The penalty, the government said, had been reduced because JPMorgan cooperated substantially with the investigation. “The civil settlement resolves a number of OFAC allegations dating back to 2005, none of which involved any intent to violate OFAC regulations. These rare incidents were unrelated and isolated from each other,” said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan. “We are pleased to have resolved these matters and to move forward with enhancements to our global OFAC compliance program.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/banks-test-monthly-fees-for-debit-cards/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Banks Test Monthly Fees for Debit Cards<date>August 25, 2011, 2:01 pm</date><text>Bloomberg Using a debit card for purchases has become second nature to many of us. But now some banks are taking steps that make the cards less attractive, by charging monthly fees for their use with some checking accounts. The moves follow the heated debate over limiting the “swipe” fees that banks charge retailers for processing debt transactions. Banks say they have to make up that lost interchange-fee income from somewhere — for example, by eliminating debit card rewards programs, and by adding fees on customers for shopping with debit cards. Wells Fargo, for instance, is notifying customers this month that beginning in October, the bank will test a debit card “activity fee” of $3 a month when a customer makes a purchase or payment with a debit card linked to a personal or business checking account. (ATM transactions won’t trigger the fee.) The test will affect accounts opened in five states: Oregon, New Mexico, Nevada, Georgia and Washington. The bank said the accounts will continue to carry perks including “card personalization,” which lets you put a photo of, say, your dog on your card. (Gee, thanks.) “This is one of those ways we are looking at recouping lost revenue,” said a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Lisa Westermann, in an e-mail. SunTrust Bank recently implemented a $5-a-month fee for debit card purchases for holders of its basic Everyday Checking account and will add the fee to its student checking account next spring. In any given month, if the customer uses the debit card to make a purchase — either using a signature or a PIN — the bank will charge a single $5 fee. The fee doesn’t apply to use of the card for ATM transactions. “As I’m sure you’re aware, a debit card usage fee is a growing trend due to changes in the environment in which our industry operates,” Hugh Suhr, a SunTrust spokesman, said in an e-mail. Regions Bank, meanwhile, now charges a $4 monthly fee for debit card purchases for holders of its basic LifeGreen Checking account and its student checking account, according to the bank’s Web site. (The fee doesn’t apply to ATM transactions and is waived if you don’t make any purchases with the card.) JPMorgan Chase is testing a $3 monthly fee for a debit card with a basic checking account in northern Wisconsin. (Customers there have three other accounts to choose from that provide a debit card with no fee, according to a bank spokesman.) Would you cut back on use of your debit card, if your bank charges you a fee for shopping with it?</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/realestate/commercial/retail-tenant-sought-for-former-jp-morgan-headquarters.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Retail Tenant Sought for Former J.P. Morgan Headquarters<date>Published: August 23, 2011</date><text>The intersection of Wall and Broad Streets, when J. P. Morgan’s headquarters at 23 Wall Street glowered sternly over a daily parade of stock brokers and tourists, was the epicenter of the financial world.From the inside, the immense paneled windows at 23 Wall reveal views of the New York Stock Exchange, and the building’s facade still bears blast marks from where a bomb was detonated in 1920, possibly by an Italian anarchist protesting the rapid rise of American capitalism. But for all its symbolism, the fortress that J. Pierpont Morgan built in 1914 to house his growing financial firm has languished without a tenant for nearly five years. That void at the heart of the financial district may be closer to being filled now that brokers have been enlisted to aggressively market approximately 150,000 square feet of retail space at the building, known as the Corner. “We really believe this space could be transformative for Lower Manhattan,” said Matthew Seigel, a senior retail director with Cushman &amp; Wakefield who, with an executive vice president, Joanne Podell, was tapped last month to market and lease the landmark four-story asset for its owner, China Sonangol. “Ten years ago we couldn’t have even had this conversation,” Mr. Seigel said. “With the area’s growing residential community, we believe it’s poised for a real change.” Most recently used to house offices and a training center for JPMorgan Chase, the property will be offered to large, upscale department stores like Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s. But the brokers say that the space would also work well for, say, Apple, which, despite branching out in SoHo and on the Upper West Side, has yet to open a retail outlet in Lower Manhattan. The available retail space, which includes three sublevels, is made up of 23 Wall Street, 35 Wall Street and 15 Broad Street — a 42-story condominium with interiors designed by Philippe Starck. “Everybody’s excited and curious,” Ms. Podell said of the space, which, because of its hexagonal shape, has yet to be calibrated with an asking rental price. “And a couple of the department stores have already called about it,” she said. Any of those tenants would fit nicely in an area, where, since 2005, luxury retailers like Hermès, Tiffany, Canali, BMW and True Religion jeans have opened their doors not only to the crowds of tourists and stockbrokers who cross Wall Street daily, but also to a growing residential population. Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in fact, the number of residents living in Lower Manhattan has more than doubled, to 56,000 this year from 22,904, according to data provided by the Downtown Alliance, a civic and business advocacy group. And with the number of residents still growing, Lower Manhattan — once a relative no man’s land for retailers — is being recast as a new commercial hub. “Retail is an important component of the new algorithm of Wall Street,” said Elizabeth H. Berger, the president of the Downtown Alliance. “Retail continues to diversify on Wall Street and reflect the new Lower Manhattan, which is a globally competitive and well-known business address that’s supported by a fast-growing, sophisticated, affluent, residential community and among the city’s largest tourism populations,” Ms. Berger said. Completed one year after the death of J. Pierpont Morgan, the building was designed by the architectural firm of Trowbridge &amp; Livingstone to support as many as 30 floors. For aesthetic reasons, however, expansion plans never went forward and, as such, it stands out on a street where 40-story properties are typical. Inside the building, a three-story bank vault, built with nickel steel, armor, concrete and cast steel, remains intact. Weighing a hefty 52 tons, the vault’s door, the brokers said, will not be detached for the new retailers. For one prospective tenant, whom Ms. Podell described as a metal manufacturer, the vault was the building’s main selling point. “He wanted to know if he could actually use the vault to store his metals,” she said. According to a 1915 article from The Architectural Record, the bank baron spared no expense on the vault or the building itself, importing large blocks of pink Knoxville marble, with the heaviest weighing about 35 tons. He also incorporated many design flourishes of the era. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 25, 2011 An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about efforts to find a tenant for the former J.P.

The answer is, more than you might think. AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile do not require cellphone customers to use a password on their voice mail boxes, and plenty of people never bother to set one up. But if you don’t, people using a service colloquially known as caller ID spoofing could disguise their phone as yours and get access to your messages. This is possible because voice mail systems often grant access to callers who appear to be phoning from their own number. Meanwhile, as Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate who founded ConsumerWorld.org, discovered recently, someone armed with just a bit of personal information about a target can also gain access to the automated phone systems for Bank of America and Chase credit card holders. Once those systems recognize the phone number of the incoming call and those bits of personal information, they offer up the latest on the cardholder’s debts, late payments and credit limits. Bank of America’s computer will even read off a list of dozens of recent charges, including names of doctors and other businesses the cardholder might have patronized. There are additional steps that the mobile phone companies and the card issuers could take to stop this sort of thing from ever happening. The fact that many of them don’t, however, makes this your problem to solve. These sorts of breaches wouldn’t happen without spoofing, and surprisingly enough, it’s an activity that turns out to be perfectly legal, up to a point. Commercial spoofing operations, which began offering services to individuals about seven years ago, are easy to find and cost $10 or so for 60 minutes of calling time. A Google search on “caller ID spoofing” leads to many providers with names like SpoofCard, whose slogan is “Be Who You Want to Be.” Registered users call an access number (or use a form on a Web site) and enter the phone number they are calling and the phone number they want to show up on the caller ID display of the person they are calling. Then the service puts the call through. Late last year, President Obama signed the Truth in Caller ID Act, which prohibits knowingly using spoofing services to defraud, cause harm or wrongfully obtain anything of value. The fine is up to $10,000 for a single incident. The new law, however, is not much of a disincentive for people already engaged in illegal activity. After all, for years, even before commercial services were available, hacker thieves were manipulating caller ID information to convince consumers that a bank was phoning. Unwitting recipients of these calls would hand over their Social Security numbers and become identity theft victims. Another common tactic was the jury duty fraud, in which thieves would program their phones to make it appear that they were calling from a local courthouse. Then they’d tell recipients that they’d missed their jury duty assignment and needed to pay a fine by credit card over the phone to avoid arrest. Once the thieves had the card numbers, they’d go on a spending spree. Given all of this, it’s hard to imagine a legitimate use for caller ID spoofing, but there are at least a few. People who have been victims of domestic violence may not want anyone to know where they are calling from. Doctors use it when calling patients from cellphones to keep patients from getting the number and pestering them later. Parents sometimes use the service as well, if they have children who tend to ignore their calls. Using spoofing services to listen to someone’s voice mail is probably not a legitimate use. That said, mobile phone voice mail systems would be more spoof-proof if they required passwords every time a user called in, no matter what phone someone was calling from. Only Verizon Wireless does this, though. After a recent article in The Boston Globe showing how vulnerable voice mail was to spoofing, AT&amp;T Wireless improved its security a bit. While it still lets users choose whether to require a password each time they call their voice mail, the default is to have them use one — the opposite of the previous practice. Sprint is similar to AT&amp;T in this regard, while T-Mobile allows users to require a password every time they call in for voice mail, but doesn’t default to that option. Why didn’t AT&amp;T force all customers to use a password? “We take the position that customers should have the information and tools available to make the right decision for them,” said Mark Siegel, a spokesman. Mr. Dworsky of ConsumerWorld, a former consumer protection lawyer for the state of Massachusetts, read the Globe article and wondered whether some credit card companies’ phone systems recognized callers if they were phoning in from a particular number. 1 2 Next Page » Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.For all of the palace intrigue recently about who in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation kingdom knew what about phone hacking when, one fundamental question about the scandal has gone mostly unanswered:</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/star-analysts-are-back-no-autographs-please/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Star Analysts Are Back (No Autographs, Please)<date>August 20, 2011, 9:09 am</date><text>Minh Uong/The New York Times THEY are the new tastemakers of Web investing, the supposed seers of Bubble-Tech 2.0. And despite the stock market’s recent craziness, they are almost as hot as some of the stocks they cover. Long after star analysts of the dot-com era self-destructed, along with Pets.com and its sock puppet, a new generation of Wall Street researchers is grabbing attention — and a lot of money. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink These Internet analysts are nowhere nearly as famous (or infamous) as Jack Grubman and Henry Blodget, who came to symbolize the conflicted, let’s-put-lipstick-on-this-pig research of the dot-com era. Nor are they as influential as Mary Meeker, the onetime Queen of the Net at Morgan Stanley, whose pronouncements captivated the investing public in the late 1990s. But not since those heady days of the Nasdaq stock market bubble has working as a technology analyst seemed so, well, sexy. Even as the economy wobbles again, there’s money to be made in providing banking advice to big names like Facebook. And the great investment houses are sparring over specialists in Web search and social media, who are hired to tell the stories of these hot companies to investors. Such analysts have been jumping from one bank to another, chasing the highest offer. Today, some of these analysts are pulling down several million dollars a year — figures that, not so long ago, would have been almost unthinkable. Graphic: Three Analysts’ Stock Recommendations (Click for Larger Image) Even in Wall Street circles, some people wonder whether all of this is another sign that Internet mania is again spinning out of control. Add to this the recent turbulence in the financial markets — including big declines in technology stocks — and you might conclude that some analysts yet again were telling investors to buy at exactly the wrong time. Gustavo G. Dolfino, president of a Wall Street recruitment firm, the WhiteRock Group, has conducted searches for roughly a dozen analyst positions so far this year, versus seven in all of 2010. “It is red-hot out there,” Mr. Dolfino says. Whether the bull market in technology specialists will last if the economy and markets sour is anyone’s guess. Hype or not, talk that companies like LinkedIn, Facebook and Groupon will change the way we live and do business — and make their shareholders rich in the process — has Wall Street pining for the fees that come with taking these companies public. And, in turn, the banks need people who can explain these companies to investors and, hopefully, spot the right time to buy or sell. Banking executives rarely talk publicly about how much they pay employees, particularly their stars. But privately, insiders at several banks have been buzzing about a number of Internet analysts who made big-money moves this year. According to people familiar with the compensation of various analysts, here are three analysts who have done well of late: Douglas Anmuth was lured to JPMorgan Chase earlier this year with a pay package valued at roughly $2 million. He had been making about $1.3 million at Barclays Capital, an arm of the British bank. Heather Bellini landed at Goldman Sachs with a remarkable pay package worth almost $3 million. And Mark Mahaney, whom JPMorgan tried to hire with an offer of about $3 million, stayed on at Citigroup — after getting a raise. The three analysts, as well as media officers for the banks, declined to comment for this article. ON the surface, the work of a stock analyst might seem straightforward. You size up companies, run the numbers, handicap potential winners and losers and issue one of three classic stock recommendations: buy, hold or sell. In practice, it’s more complicated than that. Even after the dot-com imbroglio, the subsequent research scandal, the financial collapse of 2008-9 and all the ups and downs in between, Wall Street rarely says “sell.” Even now, for instance, just a handful of the 38 analysts who cover Bank of America, one of the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year, have a “sell” recommendation on it, according to Bloomberg. Nor, according to that data, are there very many sells on I.B.M., Microsoft, Yahoo, General Motors, General Electric, Google or Apple — the list goes on. One possible explanation is that Wall Street research reflects the inherent optimism of the marketplace — the attitude that says, “Hey, you gotta believe!” Another is that Wall Street is in the business of advising corporations and selling investments, so why bother trashing too many stocks? Whatever the case, analysts have typically ranked far below traders and bankers in Wall Street’s pecking order, in both pay and prestige. Headliners of the 1990s like Mr. Blodget, Mr. Grubman and Ms. Meeker broke out by becoming the public faces of Wall Street. Late in that decade, after Mr. Blodget correctly predicted that the share price of Amazon.com would vault above $400 — from less than $250 at the time — a new phrase entered the investment lexicon: to “Blodget” a stock. It meant that analysts could cause such a stir with seemingly over-the-top predictions that those predictions would become self-fulfilling. But the Nasdaq collapse laid bare conflicts at the heart of the Wall Street research machine. Many analysts, it turned out, were pushing stocks to help their banks win lucrative investment banking business. They were issuing favorable research reports and pitching corporate clients to clinch deals. It was good fun while it lasted, at least for some top analysts, who were pulling down $15 million or even more a year. Regulators cracked down. As part of a landmark settlement over research in 2003, major banks paid a $1.4 billion fine. Mr. Blodget and Mr. Grubman were banished from the securities industry. (Mr. Blodget is now editor in chief and C.E.O. of the Business Insider, a business and news Web site. Mr. Grubman is a managing partner at the Magee Group, giving strategic advice to telecom, media and tech companies.) The settlement forced banks to change the way their research departments operated. To avoid conflicts of interest, banks were barred from subsidizing analyst research with revenue from their investment-banking operations. Regulators specified that analysts be paid based on seniority, experience, quality of research and the demand for their services in the marketplace — not on the deals they help wrangle. Wall Street research has been searching for a viable business model ever since. Without the rich backing of investment banking, analysts’ pay plummeted. In 2001, analysts earned an average of $1.45 million. By 2005, that figure had dropped to less than $800,000, according to a study by three Harvard professors, Boris Groysberg, Paul M. Healy and David A. Maber. Professor Healy says research budgets have been cut sharply, and people who run research departments agree. One says his analysts, on average, now earn about $700,000 a year in salary and bonus. Granted, many ordinary Americans would be thrilled to make $700,000 a year. But on Planet Wall Street, it has been a big letdown for former stars. The 2003 Wall Street analyst settlement, led by Eliot Spitzer when he was the New York attorney general, still haunts the industry. Banks are often reluctant to give raises to analysts who cover industries in which their investment bankers are particularly active, for fear of drawing regulators’ attention. But just when you think the glory days of Wall Street analysts are over, the bidding wars for the new breed of Internet analysts suggest otherwise. WHATEVER financial pros say about the numbers and the metrics, the stock market is often about stories. What companies capture the imagination? Inspire a little old-fashioned greed or fear? One big story right now is social media. After LinkedIn went public at $45 a share this year, its share price shot as high as $122.91. The run-up gave LinkedIn one of the highest valuations, based on its ratio of stock price to earnings, of any nonfinancial company in the United States. Was Wall Street insane? It was great news for LinkedIn investors, and for companies like Facebook, which appears set to go public in the next year. Recent private investments in Facebook have valued that company at more than $100 billion. Some analysts are still upbeat. LinkedIn’s stock has since come off the boil, closing at $79.03 on Friday. But of the six analysts who cover the stock regularly, according to Thomson Reuters, two say “buy.” Three have “hold” recommendations, and one has an “underperform” rating on it, which means you should really start thinking about selling. Given the heat in this market, tech analysts are sitting pretty. The 2003 settlement laid out conditions under which analysts can get pay raises. One easy way is to get a job offer from a rival bank. “We have some leeway in pay,” says a bank research executive, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified for fear of tipping his hand to competitors. “But once an analyst has a competing offer, we can move if we want to bump pay substantially.” But analysts are a bit like stocks: they go in and out of style and are often hostage to marketplace whims. Those who happen to cover booming industries, or sectors ripe for takeovers, tend to get the most attention. Oil, mining, information technology, emerging economies — these areas are of particular focus to investors today, and, therefore, so are the analysts who cover them. Bryan Keane, an analyst who covers technology service companies like Accenture, got a pay bump of several hundred thousand dollars for moving to Deutsche Bank from Credit Suisse, according to people with knowledge of his pay. Mr. Keane and Deutsche Bank officials declined to comment. But Internet analysts are by far the hottest commodities. That is partly a function of the story, partly a function of supply. At the height of the dot-com boom, no fewer than 616 Wall Street analysts were covering Internet companies. Today, the figure is 362, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And fewer than a dozen of those specialize in social networking stocks, as Mr. Anmuth does. Mr. Mahaney at Citigroup covers Pandora, and some people expect he will cover Facebook. As long as investors bid up these stocks, Wall Street will keep bidding up the price of its analysts. BUT for better or worse, it seems unlikely that this new class of Internet analysts will ever rival the dot-com generation in reach and influence. The irony is that the Web, which these analysts embrace and celebrate, has actually shrunk their roles in the marketplace. These days, investors trawl through blogs and comment posts, run their own numbers and compare notes with other investors. Analysts are no longer the only game in town for insight and advice. And, of course, there is the matter of trust, and whether analysts as a group can ever fully regain it. Some of the tarnish of the dot-com era has stuck. Inside banks, analysts no longer have their old cachet because they can no longer help bring in investment-banking business. The good news is that some of today’s Internet analysts seem more tempered in their predictions than their predecessors did. In late June, Mr. Anmuth issued a positive report on LinkedIn after his employer, JPMorgan, helped take the company public. LinkedIn, he wrote, was “disrupting both the online and offline job recruitment markets.” With the stock then trading at around $76, he set a price target of $85. But on July 18, after shares of LinkedIn raced past $100, Mr. Anmuth pulled back. He downgraded his rating from overweight to neutral. Whether investors will listen is anyone’s guess.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/caller-id-spoofing-and-your-privacy/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Caller ID Spoofing and Your Privacy<date>August 19, 2011, 11:46 am</date><text>Robert Neubecker In this weekend’s Your Money column, I look at the question of whether United States consumers are vulnerable to the sort of phone shenanigans that tabloid reporters in Britain seem to have been engaged in for some time.

In essence, someone uses a service to make it appear that a call is coming from your phone number.

More than a dozen, apparently. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Full Coverage of H.P.'s Transformation Hewlett-Packard‘s proposed takeover of the British software maker Autonomy was drafted by a small army of investment banks and legal advisers on both sides of the Atlantic. Among the prominent names in listing are two boutique firms. One is Qatalyst Partners, the investment bank run by Frank P. Quattrone. Mr. Quattrone, the Silicon Valley veteran, who also had a hand in Motorola Mobility‘s proposed $12.5 billion sale to Google earlier this week, sold two other companies to H.P. last year: Palm for $1.2 billion and 3Par for $2 billion. And then there’s Perella Weinberg Partners, one of H.P.’s two main advisers, alongside Barclays Capital. Perella is also advising H.P. on the possible spinoff of its personal computing business. Meanwhile, Barclays is also the sole arranger of debt financing for H.P., in a role similar to JPMorgan Chase‘s blockbuster lender role in AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion deal for T-Mobile USA. (To recap: JPMorgan provided an enormous $20 billion bridge loan to AT&amp;T, a longtime client. Of course, JPMorgan later syndicated the loan.) While DealBook couldn’t learn how much Barclays is lending, the bank is expected to cover a significant amount of the purchase price. The deal could lead to relatively big paydays for the companies’ main advisers. H.P. could pay Perella and Barclays $27 million to $34 million, according to calculations by the consulting firm Freeman &amp; Company. Autonomy could pay its advisers $32 million to $40 million, with the biggest portion going to Qatalyst. Here’s the full breakdown of advisers.

That appears to be the mind-set of many nervous investors when it comes this week to financial stocks, which are down more than the broader market. Goldman Sachs is down almost 12 percent since Monday’s open. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are both down roughly 17 percent. Citigroup dropped 15 percent and JPMorgan Chase shares sank almost 9 percent. Some market insiders feel the sell-off is overdone. Bank executives are grumbling about it. There is nothing systemic seemingly going on here, they say. In some cases, banks have record-high capital levels thanks to recent regulatory rules requiring them to put up more capital against riskier businesses. Leverage, or how much money a firm borrows to fund its business, is down significantly since the financial crisis. An optimist may even argue these stocks are a screaming buy right now. All of the country’s biggest financial stocks are trading below book value, or crucial financial measure that refers to the liquidation value of a company’s assets if it were forced to sell everything. So what gives? No one cares about all that right now. “What you are seeing is the manic ‘I remember 2008’ selling,” said Glenn Schorr, a banking analyst with Nomura. “And the only thing that worked then was to get out of the way and not come back too early. The more cash they have, the safer people feel right now.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links A Rough Patch for Hedge Funds Europe Weighs Short Selling Ban Holders of financial stocks, burned by what happened in 2008, don’t want to stick around and see how this latest bump in the road ends, especially given the questions surrounding bank exposure to Europe, continued litigation stemming from the credit crisis and the potential impact of a possible recession, which threatens to crimp big money makers for the banks, including M.&amp;A., underwriting and beyond. Mr. Schorr said while most banks have stated they have bought protection to hedge against their exposure in Europe, bank investors are worried it may not matter. “There may be a voluntary restructuring instead of an actual bankruptcy so the protection they have bought might not pay off,” he said. Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities, is downright pessimistic, saying concerns over Europe and litigation are just a symptoms of larger problem, one that is systemic. “This is a continuation of 2008,” he said. “We are finally coming to grips with the fact we have a massive debt problem that needs to be dealt with. This is not a problem for our grandchildren. It is our problem. We have a financial system structured on a bankrupt currency and that system is now breaking down and a new system will arise to replace it, but we don’t yet anything to replace it. “ Mr. Bove said recently moved all his holdings into cash. While everyone’s hair seems to be on fire this week, major players including Fidelity, Wellington Management and AllianceBernstein have been big sellers of financial stocks for months now, regulatory filings show. This selling points perhaps to another concern about these stocks. Financial firms, with lower leverage levels and more rigorous capital requirements, simply won’t be able to generate anywhere near the returns they did before the financial crisis. Goldman’s return on equity was just 8 percent in the second half of this year, down from more than 30 percent in 2006. Banks argue that big shareholders are always selling in and out of their stocks. This week’s hubbub aside, the selling by some of these long-term holders suggests that concerns run deep. And even though the country’s banks are well capitalized and have significantly lowered their leverage levels since the crisis, it may be some time before investors wade in again.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/jpmorgan-hires-senior-insurance-banker-from-bank-of-america/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Hires Senior Insurance Banker From Bank of America<date>August 8, 2011, 3:54 pm</date><text>JPMorgan Chase has hired Paul Brown, a senior insurance deal-maker, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the firm announced in an internal memorandum obtained by DealBook on Monday.

This is a story about how a company can manage to turn away someone who wants to give it his money. Actually, two companies. Here’s what happened. A week or so ago, I received some mail from Chase promoting its Continental Presidential Plus MasterCard. Normally, I throw this sort of thing away without even opening it. But I live near Newark Liberty International Airport, a Continental hub, so I try to fly the carrier whenever I travel. I was curious. The Presidential Plus card is the fancier of the two Continental cards Chase offers. (The other is the OnePass card, which is nice, but doesn’t have the same number of perks as the Presidential Card.) It includes access to Continental’s and United’s airport lounges, priority security lines and elite status with hotel and rental car companies. And that’s not to mention early boarding, free checked bags and 1,000 elite-qualifying miles for every $5,000 I charge on the card. All in all, it’s a nice collection of amenities. I never fly enough in a year to attain any elite status, but with a card like this, I would get some of that treatment. Normally, the Presidential Plus card charges an annual fee of $395, making it a competitor to American Express’s Platinum Card (which charges $450 per year). That’s a bit steep, but I was being presented with a special offer in this mailing: If my application were accepted, the first year’s membership fee would be waived. That got my attention. I figured this was one of those times where I had little to lose. I mean, why not get the card, if only for a year? For me, that’s three or four flights (maybe more) where I can relax about security lines, hang out in an airport lounge, board early and get a room upgrade when I check into my hotel. Fabulous. And when the year is almost up, I can cancel the card and feel clever for having gotten something for nothing. Or, after a year of privileges and perks, I can decide I can’t live without it and pay the membership fee for a year two (which, clearly, is what Chase and Continental are hoping for). I set the offer aside as I sorted through the rest of my mail. This weekend, I thought, I’ll apply. The weekend came and I pulled out the sheet I had saved from Chase. There was a Web address to apply, continentalpresplus.com. I typed it in. “Thanks for your interest in the offer we have sent to you. Please provide the required information below so that we can locate your offer,” the site said. Then there was a blank entry field next to “12-digit invitation number.” What 12-digit invitation number? I looked at the piece of paper I had saved. It didn’t have any codes — just the Web address for the site. I then — if not physically, then mentally — slapped my forehead: I had thrown away the rest of the mailing. The number must’ve been in there. There had been a dozen pages or so and, distracted by other things, I thought it all looked like marketing malarkey so I just kept the cover letter. So that was stupid. But no big deal, I thought. I’ll just call up Chase and get my code. I called Chase Credit Cards and explained my situation. The person at the other end had no idea what I was talking about. She suggested I go visit my Chase branch. I asked her if she actually knew if they could help me, or was this what she says when she doesn’t know the answer to something. She was refreshingly candid. “That is exactly what I recommend, sir.” It was a Saturday and I didn’t have a lot going on, so I went over to my local branch. I sat down with a Chase representative and told him my story. He asked me to type in my Social Security number to pull up my profile. By the way, my profile at Chase is not thin: I have two checking accounts there, a savings account, a Chase Visa credit card and a mortgage with them. I’m all over its databases. While I’m at it, I also have a Continental OnePass account. But my man at the Chase branch pulled up nothing on my profile related to the Presidential Plus offer. He made a face. “Let me call my friend in the credit card division,” he said. A few murmured sentences and he hung up. “Sorry. She can’t do anything for you either,” he said. “Unfortunately, it’s impossible for us to track the offers back to customers.” That’s too bad, I said. After all, here I am, asking to apply for this credit card, and I can’t because I lost the piece of paper that had some numbers and letters on it. “Yeah,” the Chase rep said. “It is frustrating. What’s even more frustrating is that even if your friend got the same offer, you couldn’t use his code, as each code is unique and linked to a specific individual.” This was amazing. “So if each code is linked to a specific identity,” I said, “why can’t you find mine? Surely there’s a database somewhere that says, ‘Sam Grobart equals ABCXYZ1234’ or something, right?” “I know,” he replied. “But I can’t. But there is an online promotion right now for the Presidential Plus card. Would you be interested in that? You get a $95 statement credit when you get the card.” Unfortunately, $95 is not $395. The Chase rep agreed that this was true. I didn’t want the card that much, I explained, particularly because I was now aware of a much better offer — an offer that had been sent to me, even. “You could try calling Continental,” he said. I thanked the Chase rep for his time, went home and called Continental, not really expecting much. Sure enough, a representative from Continental told me the airline had no way of tracking the offer back to me. “You know, we may send out another mailing next quarter,” she told me. “If you’re included in that one, you may see this offer again.” “And for our departing contestants we have some lovely going-home prizes. Johnny, tell them what they’re getting.” So with this story in hand, I contacted a Chase spokesman, Paul Hartwick. I explained my situation, informed him that I was going to write about this and asked him if it was really possible that, in 2011, a promotional offer from two multibillion-dollar companies could actually hinge on a single piece of paper, as if it were a Golden Ticket from Willy Wonka. Mr. Hartwick agreed. “Our advisers have the ability to look at offers that have been received by a customer,” he wrote in an e-mail. “In your case, we simply failed to do so and for that, we are sorry.” He informed me that someone would be contacting me to solve this problem. I thanked Mr. Hartwick for his attention to this matter and his candor, but I also asked him a question: What if other people had this problem and they aren’t writing about it for The New York Times? What should they do? Mr. Hartwick suggested that the matter be taken to a supervisor and escalated beyond that if necessary. Later that day, I received a call from Chase Credit Cards’ executive office (a higher level of customer service that you can learn more about in this post from The Consumerist) informing me that they were looking into my problem and would get back to me within a day or two. I am awaiting further action, amazed that The Case of the Missing Promo Code is proving so hard to crack. Have you had a similar experience?

Under the transaction, Paetec shareholders will get 0.460 of a share of Windstream for each Paetec share, or about $891 million in stock. Windstream will also take on about $1.4 billion of Paetec’s debt. “This transaction significantly advances our strategy to drive top-line revenue growth by expanding our focus on business and broadband services,” Jeffery R. Gardner, the chief executive of Windstream, said in a statement. “The combined company will have a nationwide network with a deep fiber footprint to offer enhanced capabilities in strategic growth areas, including I.P.-based services, data centers, cloud computing and managed services.” Founded in 1998, Paetec provides voice, data and business services to nearly all of the metropolitan areas in the United States. For enterprise clients, Paetec offers cloud computing and data center solutions and a broad range of software and equipment products to help customers manage their communications networks. The deal comes as several telecommunications companies have made acquisitions to build out their broadband and data storage capacity as the shift to cloud computing gathers strength. Earlier this year, Verizon agreed to buy the informational technology services provider Terremark for $1.4 billion. In April, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of the data storage company Savvis for $2.5 billion. The acquisition of Paetec will add seven data centers and a fiber network of 36,700 miles to Windstream’s portfolio and should increase cash flow in the first year, excluding merger costs, according to the press release. The deal, which is expected to close within the next six months, should generate about $100 million in annual cost savings, the company said. Stephens and J.P. Morgan Securities served as financial advisers to Windstream, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank advised Paetec.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/goldmans-and-citigroups-bond-sale-thwarted-by-sp/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Goldman and Citigroup's Bond Sale Thwarted by S.&amp;P.<date>July 28, 2011, 2:47 pm</date><text>Mark Lennihan/Associated Press, Jin Lee/Bloomberg News and Justin Lane/European Pressphoto AgencyThe headquarters of Goldman Sachs, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Citigroup. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup shelved plans for a large commercial mortgage bond sale on Wednesday night, after Standard &amp; Poor’s told them it would not rate the sale, the banks said in a joint statement. The planned offering, for a group of mortgage-backed bonds valued at $1.5 billion, had been expected to close on Thursday, after the banks had retooled the deal to entice buyers. The deal had already priced, and investors had already laid claim to the bonds, when S.&amp;P. announced that it was re-examining its criteria for evaluating certain types of “conduit” securities, or ones with multiple borrowers. That meant the Goldman/Citigroup joint bond package, called GC4, would no longer be rated as planned. Without a rating from the agency, the deal was doomed. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink S.&amp;P. indicated “that until its review is completed, it will not assign new ratings to transactions based on those criteria, including the GC4 transaction,” the banks’ statement said. “Standard &amp; Poor’s had previously informed Goldman and Citi that they were prepared to rate the GC4 transaction.” The failed offering comes at a tough time for bond underwriters. Goldman recently reported disappointing second-quarter earnings — especially hard hit was revenue in the company’s fixed-income division, which includes bond underwriting and trading. Matthew Salem, Goldman’s head of commercial mortgage bond trading, was reported to have left the bank last week. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Mortgage-backed bond underwriting ground to a halt during the financial crisis, after the securities created havoc on balance sheets all over Wall Street. But the sector has recovered this year, with yields rising and more bonds being issued. On Thursday, after the S.&amp;P. decision, JPMorgan Chase sent a memo to its investors about one of its own commercial mortgage-backed securities, a $425 million bond package to finance a hotel portfolio owned by the Blackstone Group, according to Dow Jones. That transaction would not be affected by the new ratings criteria, JPMorgan said.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/once-unthinkable-breakup-of-big-banks-now-seems-feasible/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Once Unthinkable, Breakup of Big Banks Now Seems Feasible<date>July 27, 2011, 3:48 pm</date><text>Bebeto Matthews/Associated PressJohn A. Thain, chief of Merrill Lynch, left, and Kenneth D. Lewis, chief of Bank of America, in 2008. What was made can be unmade. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo may have venerable names, but they and the pseudo-venerable Citigroup and Bank of America are all products of countless mergers and agglomerations. There is no rule of markets that requires a financial system dominated by four cobbled-together, lumbering behemoths. Lawmakers and regulators have failed to remake our system with smaller, safer institutions. What about investors? Big bank stocks have been persistently weak, making breakups that seemed politically impossible no longer unthinkable. Bank of America’s recent quarterly earnings were so weak that investors and commentators wondered whether the bank should sell off Merrill Lynch, the investment bank for which it foolishly overpaid at the height of the crisis. Bank of America trades at half of its book value (the stated value of its assets minus its liabilities), an indication that investors view its asset quality and prospects just a notch below abominable, as Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg News pointed out last week. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink For Bank of America, the question is whether it will have to raise capital. Selling shares at such depressed prices would be costly. Regulators won’t push for it. They just gave stress tests to the biggest banks, and merely restricted the bank from paying out a dividend. The logical solution is that Bank of America shed business lines in a bid to improve its prospects in the eyes of Wall Street. Citigroup’s stock, revenue and earnings have lagged for a decade. “Look, if you can’t compete in the major leagues for over a decade, it’s time to go back to the minors,” said the always outspoken Mike Mayo, an analyst with CLSA. His chronicle of ruffling bank management feathers, “Exile on Wall Street” (Wiley), will be published in the fall. JPMorgan Chase is as well managed as any gargantuan bank can be. But if you look at its businesses, it’s hard to see any area where it is clearly the best, something even its own executives concede. Not in credit cards, where the premier name is American Express. Not in money management, where you might offer up T. Rowe Price. Investment banking — Goldman Sachs (the last quarter notwithstanding). Back-office transactions, State Street. Yet even JPMorgan is merely trading at book value. Put another way, the market regards the value that JPMorgan provides as a financial services conglomerate as zilch. How well do all of JPMorgan’s divisions work together? In presentations to investors, JPMorgan executives show how much revenue they gain from existing clients. But these measures are hardly unbiased. Executives have an incentive to defend their empires. Who is to say that a certain division of JPMorgan wouldn’t have won that business anyway? And nobody measures how much a bank loses through conflicts of interest. Even in the face of investor pressure, there are forces that would hold bank breakups back. Mainly pay. “The biggest motivation for not breaking up is that top managers would earn less,” Mr. Mayo said. “That is part of the breakdown in the owner/manager relationship. That’s a breakdown in capitalism.” Institutional investors — the major owners of the banks — are passive and conflicted. They don’t like to go public with complaints. They have extensive business ties with the banks. The few hedge fund activist investors who aren’t cowed would most likely balk at taking on such an enormous target. Also, there are reasons to think that smaller banks wouldn’t necessarily make the system safer. A wave of small bank failures can have systemic effects, as was the case in the Great Depression. Focused companies like Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns failed in the recent crisis, worsening it. Making a nuanced argument, John Hempton, a blogger, investor and former regulator in Australia, says that it’s better for shareholders — and societies — to have large banks with lots of market power. That makes them more profitable and leads them to take less risk, making them safer and more enticing for investors. Another oft-trotted-out argument against breakups: The United States needs global banks to service its giant, multinational corporations and to preserve our position in world markets. Color me unconvinced. When a giant corporation wants to do a major bond offering or a big company goes public, the banks, despite their size, don’t want to shoulder all the risk themselves, preferring to share the responsibility. If the stocks continue to lag for quarters upon years, these arguments will seem less convincing, while institutional reluctance will begin to erode. Investors don’t care about size, they care about performance. It’s undeniable that smaller banks are easier to manage. And they are easier for regulators to unwind — and therefore less terrifying to trading partners — when they fail. One of the most remarkable aspects of the debate about overhauling the financial system after the great crisis was the absence of serious contemplation of breaking up the largest banks. It’s not a perfect solution. Banks responding to investor pressure would react haphazardly. But it’s a good start.

The performance of the investment bank, which has largely shed the legacy of the financial meltdown, points to the new reality on Wall Street. Amid regulatory and economic uncertainty, Goldman is struggling to lift its earnings power to precrisis levels. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release The second-quarter profit of $1.85 a share fell short of analysts’ expectations of $2.27 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Still, it was an improvement for the period a year earlier, when Goldman posted a profit of $453 million, or 78 cents a share. The fixed-income department took a big hit in the quarter. The unit, which includes fixed Income, currency and commodities client execution, logged net revenue of $1.60 billion, 53 percent lower than in the second quarter of 2010; results were down in mortgages, commodities and interest rate products. The firm substantially reduced its risk in the three months ended June 30, an overly conservative approach that cost millions in the short term, said a person with knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak on the record. Goldman, in part, hedged its trading activities, a move that ate into profit. It also robbed the company of the upside in certain commodities like oil, the person said. David Viniar, Goldman’s chief financial officer, didn’t mince words on the firm’s call with analysts to discuss earnings. “I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” he said. “We underperformed.” The results in the fixed income department, he said, were among the weakest in the firm’s 12-year history as a public company. By one key measure, Goldman — usually considered one of Wall Street’s biggest risk takers — played it safer than in the past. Its value at risk, roughly what the firm could lose on an average day because of bad market conditions, fell to $101 million in the second quarter, down 10 percent from the first three months of the year. Chris Kleponis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesLloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. “During the second quarter, the operating environment was more difficult given global macroeconomic concerns,” said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chairman and chief executive. “In addition, certain of our businesses had disappointing results as we reduced our market risk in response to attempting to manage fluctuations in prices and market liquidity.” Not all banks were created equal this quarter, and others appeared willing to take more risk than Goldman. With its diversified business model, JPMorgan Chase posted a quarterly profit of $5.4 billion, up 13 percent from the period a year earlier. Citigroup also had a strong showing, as improvements in lending helped offset lackluster trading results. By comparison, Goldman is more dependent on the commissions generated from trading, which dropped sharply in recent months. Overall revenue at the bank fell to $7.28 billion from $8.8 billion in the period a year earlier. “Trading activity has been extremely slow,” said a Nomura stock analyst, Glenn Schorr, who accurately predicted the bank’s earnings at $1.85 a share. While the decision to dial back risk ate into profits in Goldman’s fixed income department, the firm’s other divisions posted decent returns. Net revenue in investment banking was $1.45 billion, 54 percent higher than the second quarter of 2010. Within investment banking, bond underwriting saw the best rise in net revenue, increasing 77 percent over year-ago levels to $433 million. Net revenue in investment management was $1.27 billion, 12 percent higher than the second quarter of 2010. Another closely watched number at Goldman is the compensation ratio, or percentage of net revenue allocated to pay employees. It has set aside $8.44 billion for compensation this year, while it had earmarked $9.3 billion during the same period in 2010. Most of the compensation at the firm, which comes in the form of one-time bonuses, is not allocated until the fourth quarter, so it is too early to predict the final numbers. But compensation will most likely fall if the results do not improve in the second half of the year. In an attempt to reduce overall costs, Goldman is planning to layoff employees and cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses in the next 11 months.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/all-about-chases-new-united-mileageplus-explorer-card/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">All About Chase's New United MileagePlus Explorer Card<date>July 19, 2011, 11:02 am</date><text>For United Airlines customers wondering about the fate of their miles-earning credit cards in the wake of the airlines merger with Continental, the airline offered up an answer today. It’s a new Visa card called the MileagePlus Explorer. The annual fee is $95, which is more than the $60 that many United customers are paying for the entry-level mile-earning Visa currently. But the new card comes with a number of benefits. Cardholders (and traveling companions on the same reservation) who don’t already have elite status will be able to board early, albeit after everyone with status has already gotten on the plane. Still, this should be sufficient for everyone in that boarding group to find overhead bin space and avoid having to check their bags at the gate. Big spenders will get an extra 10,000 miles each year once they pass $25,000 in annual spending (and earn the usual one mile per dollar they spend). Cardholders and one traveling companion will each be able to check one bag for free on United flights, a handy perk for people who don’t carry everything on and don’t get free baggage checking due to their elite status on the airline. You’ll also get two passes to United’s airport clubs each year. A one-day pass normally costs $39 if you buy it ahead of time online or $50 if you buya pass at the airport. They are good for one person per pass; you don’t get to bring traveling companions along for free. One thing cardholders won’t get, however, is a waiver on those dreaded 3 percent surcharges for purchases that take place outside of the United States, something that Chase’s more expensive United Club Visa offers. I asked David Gold, senior vice president for Chase Card Services, if Chase had determined that it didn’t need to offer that perk because customers would forget about the surcharge or shrug their shoulders and use that card outside of the United States anyway rather than switching cards for their trips. He countered with a more benign explanation. “There are customers who that is a pain point for, and we have a product for that,” he said. “Not every product necessarily needs that.” People who have the current $60 annual fee Chase United card can keep that card; Chase won’t upgrade you automatically. If you want to upgrade to the new one, you can call the number on the back of your card and ask to make the switch. Chances are, you will not have to change your credit card number (and redo all of your automated monthly payments with billers) if you upgrade. So those are the basics. For the true mileage junkies out there, however, there are a few more twists. With this announcement, United is revealing a couple of decisions about how it is settling conflicting rules between its loyalty program rulebook and that of Continental’s OnePass program, according to Mr. Gold. First off, Continental miles never expire, but United’s do. United’s policy will prevail, but miles will never expire for people with any of the combined company’s credit cards that levy annual fees. Second, United customers are able to use 50,000 miles to book any seat on the airplane for a domestic flight as long as it’s available for sale; Continental customers face capacity controls when trying to book those seats. Here, Continental’s policy will prevail, but annual-fee paying credit card customers will not face those capacity controls. Implementation of these special privileges will likely present a formidable information technology challenge to the combined carrier, so watch your program statements closely and appeal up the supervisory ladder if you are not getting what you are supposed to. If you’re a Chase Continental cardholder, you may be wondering what this all means for you. The combined airline intends for the United Explorer card to become the standard miles-earning card; people who have Chase’s Continental OnePass Plus card will soon receive whatever benefits the Explorer card offers that the Plus card doesn’t already. Then, sometime next year, the Continental cardholders will receive new Explorer cards to replace their Continental cards. Here too, Chase hopes to spare everyone the hassle of having to switch credit card numbers. As always, the mileage experts on FlyerTalk are picking these developments apart if you want to learn even more. Feel free to post your own assessment of the new card below as well. Will you elect to pay more than 50 percent more in annual fees to access these new perks?</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/linkedin-falls-as-jpmorgan-downgrades-its-stock/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">LinkedIn Shares Fall on JPMorgan Downgrade<date>July 18, 2011, 10:20 am</date><text>4:43 p.m. | Updated The rally in LinkedIn‘s share price has taken a bit of a hit from an unlikely source, one of the underwriters for its initial public offering. Shares in the social network fell 6.9 percent on Monday, to close at $102.44, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase downgraded the company to neutral from overweight. Not that JPMorgan, which co-led the I.P.O. alongside Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has fallen out of love with LinkedIn. “Our move to neutral here is based on valuation rather than fundamental concerns,” Doug Anmuth wrote in Monday’s note to JPMorgan clients, adding that he had a positive overall view on the company. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink JPMorgan was one of several banks whose analysts initially gave LinkedIn a warm welcome to research coverage. Mr. Anmuth, whose price target is $85 a share, wrote that the company’s risk-reward profile was better-balanced now and that there was a little less upside to the stock. LinkedIn’s shares have jumped 44 percent in the last three weeks; the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index, on the other hand, has risen just 3 percent. To show just how richly valued LinkedIn is at the moment, Mr. Anmuth pointed out that as of Friday’s close, the company had a market value of $12 billion, while Netflix had one of $15 billion — despite the fact that Netflix has revenue and net income seven times greater than those of LinkedIn. (LinkedIn is currently valued at just under $10 billion.) Mr. Anmuth conceded that his thesis could be proved wrong if LinkedIn blew past expectations for second-quarter earnings, which are to be announced on Aug. 4. Because less than 10 percent of LinkedIn’s shares are currently on the market, a major reult above analysts’ quarterly estimates could propel the stock price significantly higher.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/business/second-lien-loans-may-prompt-new-losses-for-banks.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Second-Lien Loans May Prompt New Losses for Banks<date>Published: July 16, 2011</date><text>HAVE you heard the good news? Big banks are making more money than we thought. On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase said it earned $5.4 billion during the second quarter. On Friday, Citigroup said it earned $3.3 billion. Despite such happy tidings, many banks face a daunting challenge, and one federal regulators want to know more about: the potential costs associated with home loans that banks made during the great credit mania. Still to be dealt with are potentially large legal bills — and settlements — related to accusations that many banks acted improperly, first in bundling all those loans into mortgage securities, and later in foreclosing on homeowners. Under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, banks have been estimating the potential damage in their financial filings. Last October, the S.E.C. warned them to be scrupulous in detailing risks associated with demands that they buy back soured loans or securities, as well as about possible defects in securitizations and foreclosures. But while the S.E.C. has been pressing banks to make comprehensive disclosures about these potential pitfalls, regulators have been quiet on another worry for investors: how banks are valuing their vast holdings of home equity lines of credit, also known as second liens. Privately, however, the S.E.C. has been pushing banks hard on this issue, according to Meredith Cross, the director of the commission’s corporation finance unit. As regulators review banks’ annual reports, they are asking tough questions about how institutions are valuing their second liens. Ms. Cross expects banks to provide more details about these loans in quarterly reports due next month. The numbers are significant. Banks held $624 billion of such loans in the first quarter, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data show. Millions of these loans are deeply troubled. According to CoreLogic, a real estate data concern, almost 11 million of the nation’s mortgaged properties — nearly 23 percent of the total — were underwater at the end of March. Some 4.5 million of those properties carried home equity loans, according to CoreLogic. The average amount of negative equity shouldered by borrowers across the nation was $65,000. WHEN first mortgages run into trouble, second liens are at greater peril, even if homeowners manage to keep up with their payments. That is because in a foreclosure, first mortgages are supposed to be paid off before second mortgages. It is not clear that is happening, however. Banks like the big four — JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — not only hold home equity lines but also service first mortgages held by others on the same properties. Some analysts worry that servicers are able to protect their own holdings of second-lien loans while foreclosing on the first liens. “The big four are pretending that the second liens are still money good because many are still performing,” said Christopher Whalen, editor of the Institutional Risk Analyst, a research publication. By performing, he means that borrowers are still making payments, if only the minimum. Many home equity lines require only the payment of interest for the first 10 years. Banks have written off about $500 billion in assets since 2008, Mr. Whalen said. Most of those assets were related to housing, but write-downs on second liens have been pretty sparse so far at the big banks. As of the first quarter of this year, Bank of America carried $136 billion of second liens on its books. During 2010, it wrote down $6.8 billion. Wells Fargo held $108 billion in such loans in the first quarter; it wrote down $4.7 billion last year. JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to second liens stood at $60 billion at the end of the second quarter. The bank charged off $1.3 billion in the first half of 2011 and $3.44 billion in 2010, said Joseph M. Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank. As for how Morgan values these assets, he said that since 2010 the bank has routinely reserved for the higher probability of defaults on them, assuming an average loss rate of 60 percent on high-risk second liens. Citibank’s home equity lines of credit totaled $46 billion last March; $6.2 billion belonged to borrowers with credit scores below 660 — that is, risky — and consisted of loan amounts that were greater than the values of the underlying properties. Spokeswomen for Wells Fargo and Citigroup declined to comment. Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, says the bank considers whether first mortgages are distressed when valuing home equity loans. If the second liens are performing, the bank doesn’t book a full loss on them. But if foreclosure seems inevitable on a first mortgage, the bank books a 100 percent loss on the second lien, he said. But Mr. Whalen suspects some values are too high. The trouble in the housing market does not appear to be reflected fully on bank balance sheets yet. . “If home prices do not stabilize, much less recover, then banks are likely to feel pressure to begin wholesale write-downs of first and second liens,” Mr. Whalen said. “There is probably as much loss prospectively facing the banking industry as a whole on residential real estate exposures as have already been charged off.” DENIAL in the banking industry — known in the trade as “extend and pretend” — is a powerful thing.

The stock market then gives its verdict. On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase started out with an upbeat report, posting net income of $5.4 billion for the second quarter, which exceeded analysts’ estimates. The market liked what it saw: the bank’s stock jumped 3.5 percent in premarket trading on Thursday, and by early afternoon JPMorgan’s shares were still trading up 2.4 percent, at $40.56. JPMorgan’s earnings are typically considered a bellwether for the health of financial stocks, and several other banks recorded small gains in premarket trading on Thursday. But by midafternoon, most had settled back down. Goldman Sachs was trading up less than 1 percent, while Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were flat or showing marginal losses.

Hammered by legal troubles and threatened with an increases in capital requirements, many banks have shown double-digit losses in their stock prices this year.

But on Thursday, robust gains in almost all of JPMorgan Chase’s main businesses offered some hope that the industry’s prospects are not as bad as feared. Over all, the bank said second-quarter revenue climbed 7 percent to $27.4 billion — a strong showing amid a stagnant consumer economy and some of the most challenging trading conditions of the last few years. That helped JPMorgan handily beat analysts’ consensus estimates with a profit of $5.4 billion, or $1.27 a share. Still, it was not enough to lift beaten-down bank stocks. Shares of Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo fell slightly on Thursday. The solid revenue figures fly in the face of the dismal projections by many Wall Street analysts, who have been warning that banking is quickly returning to a boring, low-growth business. The figures also take some of the air out of the financial industry’s arguments that new regulations are depressing revenue and stifling the fragile economic recovery. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release JPMorgan Names Co-Head of North America Investment Banking Even the chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has raised concerns about the cost of the new rules, acknowledged that his bank would be able to make up a big part of the missing revenue. “JPMorgan will be just fine,” he said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. Bank officials said the revenue levels largely reflected a modest increase in lending and an uptick in fee income that could be sustained in the months ahead. For example, JPMorgan’s investment bank had a sharp increase in underwriting fees for debt and equity, as well as a big increase in deal advisory income that helped offset weaker trading results. Its Chase retail banking unit benefited from more profitable home lending and an increase in fee income from checking accounts, debit cards and the sale of investment products. That helped it absorb charges totaling almost $1 billion to cover mortgage losses, and an additional $2.3 billion in charges tied to rising legal and foreclosure costs. Revenue in its corporate banking, asset management and treasury services units also grew. Only the bank’s big credit card business, Chase Card Services, had a decline in revenue from a year ago. It fell 7 percent as a result of legislation that eliminated lucrative penalty fees and its decision to shed a risky credit card portfolio it had acquired with Washington Mutual. The rest of the banking industry has been bracing for lower top-line growth. Besides the impact of the new financial regulations, the weak job and housing markets have curtailed lending. Ultra-low interest rates are putting pressure on profit margins. And Wall Street trading revenue, which helped prop up the banks’ results in wake of the 2008 financial crisis, also has slowed. All told, revenue for the banking industry is expected to fall more than 5 percent, to about $186 billion in the second quarter, according to Trepp, a financial research firm. That would put it near 2005 levels. Second-quarter profits, however, are likely to be far more robust than a year ago — about $30.6 billion industrywide, up 41 percent. The reason is that many banks stand to benefit from the reversal of funds they had previously set aside to cover losses or legal claims. That windfall can help pad bank bottom lines, even if there is little top-line growth. In JPMorgan’s case, a $1 billion benefit from the reversal in credit card loan loss reserves contributed to about 12 percent of its second-quarter, pretax earnings. For the entire industry in the first quarter, about $12.6 billion, or roughly 43 percent of profits, came from the release of reserves. Analysts expect to see similar trends in the second quarter. Citigroup, which will report on Friday, is expected to show revenue falling about 9 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. Net income, the analysts project, will rise about 9 percent amid lower losses on credit card and corporate loans. At Goldman Sachs, which will report on Tuesday, revenue is expected to fall about 3.5 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates. Profit could rise sharply from the second quarter of 2010, when the bank took a big charges to cover the British tax on bonuses and resolve allegations by federal securities regulators that it had misled investors on a complex mortgage deal. Revenue at Bank of America, which also will report on Tuesday, was expected to drop about 15 percent, largely because of $20 billion worth of charges tied to the cleanup of its mortgage troubles, which it announced in late June. As a result, the bank warned that it would lose $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion. Some analysts suggest that JPMorgan’s strong results could be the exception rather than the rule. Much depends on how banks fare in the most unpredictable of businesses — trading. “For those who own these stocks, it was a pleasant beginning to the earnings season,” said Frederick Cannon, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. “But one point doesn’t make a line.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1DF1739F932A25754C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Weak Results Are Projected For Wall Street<date>Published: July 11, 2011</date><text>Only a few short months ago, JPMorgan Chase traders were on such a roll that they did not have a single losing day in the first quarter. But when the bank reports its second-quarter results this week, that hot streak will have come to an end. Analysts expect JPMorgan to count an almost 20 percent drop in its sales and trading revenues, reflecting a slowdown in investor activity and the dismal performance of its fixed-income and commodities groups. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to report similar news. After helping prop up Wall Street during the financial crisis, core trading revenue is projected to drop, on average, by as much as 25 percent from the first quarter, according to Credit Suisse research. That will put further pressure on the banks' growth prospects, which are already strained by stagnant loan growth and more stringent regulation. It is also prompting nearly every major Wall Street firm to contemplate another round of layoffs amid growing concerns that at least part of the weak results are permanent. ''We are undoubtedly being impacted by lower levels of activity,'' said William Tanona, a financial services analyst with UBS. ''There is a lot of uncertainty out there.'' Together, the five Wall Street banks are still going to take in more than $20 billion from their core trading operations, largely from business done on behalf of clients. For example, the banks routinely help airlines hedge oil prices or bring together buyers and sellers of stock, bonds and other complex securities -- often putting their own money on the line to facilitate a trade. But during the second quarter, the business was particularly hard hit. Trading volumes fell sharply as investors became unnerved by the running debt crisis in Europe, the political standoff over the debt ceiling in the United States, and lingering concerns over the anemic growth of the broader economy. Even when investors did place their bets, they were far more hesitant to take big risks -- something known on Wall Street as lacking conviction. That meant the banks missed out on the lucrative fees they can generate by selling more high-octane products, like complex options and derivatives. Fixed-income traders, among the biggest moneymakers for Wall Street, faced a bruising market. In the commodities business, for example, oil, gold and other metals prices had been rising quickly during the early part of the year as investors anticipated high demand for materials to keep the global economy humming. But as cracks in the recovery kept surfacing, prices headed south -- and traders raced to the sidelines. That left most Wall Street desks, which had stocked up on inventory to facilitate trades, holding losing positions. At JPMorgan, for instance, energy traders were having a gangbuster year, earning several hundred million dollars for its burgeoning commodities unit. Yet when the market turned in early May, they gave back some of those gains, according to market participants. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suffered tens of millions in losses on its interest rate desk when a bet on lower inflation turned against the bank's position. Mortgage trading did not fare much better. After rallying from highly depressed values for much the last two years, mortgage-backed securities prices fell sharply during the second quarter. The reason? The government started dumping into the market its vast portfolio of mortgage bonds acquired from its rescue of the American International Group, and investors believed the outsize supply would cause values to plummet. (Only recently, when the Treasury announced it was halting its auctions, did mortgage bond prices start to stabilize.) Although the banks have slowed the spill of red ink from troubled mortgages and other bad loans, they are struggling to increase revenue in their more traditional banking businesses, too. New financial regulations have chipped away at once-lucrative sources of income, like overdraft charges and credit card penalty fees. Starting this fall, banks are expecting to absorb a multibillion-dollar hit when they are forced to sharply lower the fees they charge each time consumers swipe their debit cards. Higher capital requirements, meanwhile, could further depress profits if some banks are forced to lighten their balance sheets or exit certain businesses altogether.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/business/jpmorgan-settles-bond-bid-rigging-case-for-211-million.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Settles Bond Bid-Rigging Case for $211 Million<date>Published: July 7, 2011</date><text>JPMorgan Chase reached a $211 million settlement with federal and state authorities on Thursday to resolve allegations that it cheated governments in 31 states by rigging the bidding process for reinvesting the proceeds of dozens of municipal bond transactions.   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the bank settled accusations that it had improperly entered secret agreements with bidding agents that gave it a “last look” at bids submitted by its competitors. The bank has agreed to return about $129.7 million to the municipalities that were harmed. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would bar James L. Hertz, a former JPMorgan executive at the center of the bid-rigging scandal, from working in the municipal finance industry. Last December, Mr. Hertz pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud charges for his role in the improper deals. JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it “does not tolerate anticompetitive activity” and that the executives involved had concealed their behavior from management. “The firm’s policies, both now and during the period in question, expressly prohibit the conduct that gave rise to these proceedings,” the statement said. The bank said the employees involved were no longer with the company and that it had improved its compliance program and increased ethics training for staff in the public finance group. The $211 million pact is the largest of three major settlements that securities regulators have reached in an effort to clean up municipal finance. In December, authorities struck a $137 million settlement with Bank of America to resolve similar fraud charges. In May, UBS agreed to pay more than $150 million to settle municipal bid-rigging charges. The JPMorgan settlement was reached amid public outrage toward Wall Street for its role in the financial crisis. Federal regulators are under increasing pressure to hold bankers accountable. To resolve the charges, JPMorgan plans to pay $51.2 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $50 million to the Internal Revenue Service, $35 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and $75 million to a group of state attorneys general. The bank also reached settlements with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the antitrust division of the Justice Department. Elaine C. Greenberg, the chief of the S.E.C.’s municipal securities unit, said that the settlement would send a message that undermining the fairness of the public sector bond market would not be tolerated.  “Rather than playing by the rules, the rules got played,” she said in a statement. Typically, when investors buy municipal bonds, local governments temporarily invest the tax-exempt proceeds until they are used. Banks help states and cities invest the money in so-called municipal reinvestment products and bid for the right by offering competitive interest rates. That process lets municipalities claim tax-exempt status for the money. But regulators say JPMorgan undermined the competition. From 1997 to 2005, they say, members of the bank’s municipal derivatives desk made misrepresentations and omissions in at least 93 transactions. The moves affected the prices that governments paid and jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars worth of those securities. JPMorgan marketers rigged the bids with help from at least 11 bidding agents. At times, court documents said, the bank won investment business because it got information from bidding agents about what its competitors were bidding. In other cases it deliberately submitted nonwinning bids to satisfy tax requirements. The case was settled on the heels of a JPMorgan settlement last month in which it agreed to pay $153.6 million to resolve federal civil accusations that it misled investors in a mortgage securities transaction in 2007. In a case simultaneously brought and settled, the S.E.C. asserted that JPMorgan’s investment bank had structured and marketed a security known as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation without informing buyers that a hedge fund that helped select the assets in the portfolio stood to gain, in most cases, if the investment lost value.JPMorgan Chase reached a $211 million settlement with federal and state authorities on Thursday to resolve allegations that it cheated governments in 31 states by rigging the bidding process for reinvesting the proceeds of dozens of municipal bond transactions.   </text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/livingsocial-taps-3-banks-to-lead-its-i-p-o/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">LivingSocial Taps 3 Banks to Lead Its I.P.O.<date>July 8, 2011, 2:57 pm</date><text>Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg NewsTim O’Shaughnessy, the chief executive of LivingSocial. 4:49 p.m. | Updated LivingSocial, the biggest competitor to Groupon in the social-coupon space, has picked three banks to lead its forthcoming initial public offering, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Friday. The company has picked Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Merrill Lynch as its lead underwriters, these people said. LivingSocial is only the latest start-up to seek a stock listing to tap into burgeoning public demand for Internet companies. Having picked its underwriters, the social-buying company is likely to file for an I.P.O. in the coming weeks, one of these people said. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The company is aiming to raise around $1 billion in the stock sale, valuing the company at about $10 billion to $15 billion, these people said. LivingSocial’s remarkable growth in valuation — in April the company raised $400 million in a round that valued it at $3 billion — is yet another reflection of the frenzy among investors to grab a piece of the new Internet pie. Its main rival, Groupon, has already filed for an I.P.O. and may seek to raise as much as $3 billion at a $30 billion valuation. One concern facing both companies is a flood of new competitors, including Internet heavyweights like Google and Facebook. The two companies share JPMorgan and Bank of America as underwriters, though the banks are playing a more passive role in Groupon’s I.P.O. That offering is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. Begun as a maker of apps for Facebook, LivingSocial moved into the nascent social-buying space two years ago and has quickly grown into a major player in the increasingly crowded field. The company’s chief executive, Tim O’Shaughnessy, told DealBook in April that it was on track to reach $1 billion in revenue this year. An I.P.O. could provide a cash-out opportunity for LivingSocial’s investors, who include Amazon, Lightspeed Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price and Institutional Venture Partners.

The list of cards that have eliminated foreign transaction fees, which tack up to 3 percent onto your purchases, is growing, and using the right card can save you money on your vacation. The latest entry to the field is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. The card carries no foreign transaction fees and is offering a bonus of 50,000 rewards points if you spend $3,000 in the first three months. The card has a $95 annual fee, but it’s waived for the first year. The Sapphire card joins Chase’s existing offerings that don’t charge the annoying fees, including its British Airways Visa Signature Card, the Hyatt Card and the Priority Club Select Visa Card. Capital One offers several cards with no foreign exchange fees and no annual fee as well; card comparison site Cardhub.com has a list. Citigroup has eliminated the charges on its ThankYou Premier and ThankYou Prestige cards. And American Express doesn’t charge the fees on its Platinum and Centurion cards. An analysis by Cardhub showed that using credit cards with no currency conversion fees save consumers an average of 7.9 percent when compared to exchange rates offered at banks and 14.7 percent when compared to airport exchange services. Even if you are stuck with a card that charges the fee, you’ll still come out ahead using plastic, the survey found: You’ll save 4.9 percent on average and 11.7 percent, compared to banks and airport currency exchange services, respectively.

Rula Giosmas is one of the beneficiaries. Last year she received a letter from Chase saying it was cutting in half the amount she owed on her condominium. Ms. Giosmas, who lives in Miami, was not in default on her $300,000 loan. She did not understand why she would receive this gift — although she wasted no time in taking it. Banks are proactively overhauling loans for borrowers like Ms. Giosmas who have so-called pay option adjustable rate mortgages, which were popular in the wild late stages of the housing boom but which banks now view as potentially troublesome. Before Chase shaved $150,000 off her mortgage, Ms. Giosmas owed much more on her place than it was worth. It was a fate she shared with a quarter of all homeowners with mortgages across the nation. Being underwater, as it is called, can prevent these owners from moving and taking new jobs, and places the households at greater risk of foreclosure. “It’s a huge problem,” said the economist Sam Khater. “Reducing negative equity would spark a housing recovery.” While many homeowners desperately need help to keep their homes and cannot get it, the borrowers getting unsolicited relief from Chase sometimes suspect a trick. Cutting loan balances, even for loans in default, is supposedly so rare that Federal Reserve economists wrote in a paper in March that “we could find no evidence that any lender was actually reducing principal” on mortgages. “I used to say every day, ‘Why doesn’t anyone get rewarded for doing the right thing and paying their bills on time?’ ” said Ms. Giosmas, who is an acupuncturist and real estate investor. “And I got rewarded.” Option ARM loans like Ms. Giosmas’s gave borrowers the option of skipping the principal payment and some of the interest payment for an introductory period of several years. The unpaid balances would be added to the body of the loan. Bank of America and Chase inherited their portfolios of option ARMs when they bought troubled lenders during the housing crash. Chase, which declined to comment on its program, got $50 billion in option ARM loans when it bought Washington Mutual in 2008. The lender, which said last fall that it had dealt with 22,000 option ARM loans with an unpaid principal balance of $8 billion, still has $33 billion of them in its portfolio. Bank of America acquired a portfolio of 550,000 option ARMs from its purchase of Countrywide Financial in 2008. The lender said more than 200,000 had been converted to more stable mortgages. Dan B. Frahm, a spokesman for Bank of America, said it was using every technique short of principal reduction to remake its loans, including waiving prepayment penalties, refinancing, lowering the interest rate, postponing some of the balance and extending the term. “By proactively contacting pay option ARM customers and discussing other products with better options for long-term, affordable payments, we hope to prevent customers from reaching a point where they struggle to make their payments,” Mr. Frahm said. Chase, Bank of America and the other big lenders are negotiating with the Obama administration and the nation’s attorneys general over foreclosures. Debt forgiveness and the moral hazard question of who deserves to be helped are among the most contentious issues. The banks say cutting mortgage balances would be unfair to borrowers who remain current as well as impractical because so many loans are securitized into pools owned by investors. Bank of America’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, told the attorneys general in April that cutting principal for current borrowers would send the wrong message to all those who have struggled to pay their bills. His counterpart at Chase, Jamie Dimon, bluntly said it was “off the table.” Having an option ARM loan, however, apparently qualifies the borrower for special help. The loans, with their low initial payments and “teaser” interest rates, were immediately popular with buyers who could not afford or did not want to pay the soaring prices on houses. The problem was, eventually the rate would reset or the loan balance would have to be paid in full. “Nightmare Mortgages” they were called in a 2006 BusinessWeek cover piece. Option ARMs were never quite as bad as predicted, partly because the crisis pushed down interest rates so far that the resets were relatively mild. Many owners did default on them, but others, like Ms. Giosmas, were quite happy to pay less for years than they would have under a conventional loan. She used option ARMs on her investment properties too. “They saved me,” she said. “Why would I want to pay a lot more every month? I’d rather have it in my pocket.” The concern the banks are showing for those who might get in trouble contrasts sharply with their efforts toward those already foreclosed. Bank of America and Chase were penalized last month by regulators for doing a poor job modifying mortgages in default. Adam J. Levitin, a Georgetown University law professor, said these little-publicized programs were more evidence that the banks were behaving in contradictory and often maddening ways. “Loan modifications that should be happening aren’t, while loan modifications that shouldn’t be happening are,” he said. “Homeowners of any sort, whether current or in default, would rightly be confused and angry by this.” The homeowners getting new loans, however, are quite pleased. In effect, the banks are paying the debt these owners accrued as the housing market plunged. Ms. Giosmas bought her two-bedroom, two-bath apartment north of downtown Miami for $359,000 in early 2006, according to real estate records. She made a large down payment, but because each month she paid less than was necessary to pay off the loan, her debt swelled to about $300,000. Meanwhile, the value of the apartment nosedived. By the time Ms. Giosmas got the letter from Chase, the condominium was worth less than half what she paid. “I would not have defaulted,” she said. “But they don’t know that.” The letter, which Ms. Giosmas remembers as brief and “totally vague,” said Chase was cutting her principal by $150,000 while raising her interest rate to about 5 percent. Her payments would stay roughly the same. A few months ago, Ms. Giosmas sold the place for $170,000, making a small profit. Having a loan that her lender considered toxic, she said, “turned out to be a blessing in disguise.”As millions of Americans struggle in foreclosure with little hope of relief, big banks are going to borrowers who are not even in default and cutting their debt or easing the mortgage terms, sometimes with no questions asked.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/after-bank-of-america-whos-next/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">After Bank of America, Who's Next?<date>June 30, 2011, 8:40 am</date><text>The pitchforks are out.

Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Mr. Urwin was previously a co-head of investment banking at Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan purchased in the spring of 2008. He began at Bear in 1996, eventually rising to co-head of global investment banking there, and previously worked at Lehman Brothers and Samuel Montagu &amp; Company of Britain. JPMorgan’s other co-head of North American investment banking, Kevin Willsey, will remain in that role. He was previously the head of the firm’s equity capital and derivative markets. He began working at J.P. Morgan &amp; Company in 1989, with a stint at Goldman Sachs from 2000 to 2002. Mr. Urwin and Mr. Willsey assumed the North American investment banking roles last year when they succeeded Douglas Braunstein, who became JPMorgan’s chief financial officer. JPMorgan will name a replacement for Mr. Urwin soon, according to the memo. Here’s the memo from Mr. Staley: We interact in a global marketplace at a pace and along dimensions not possible as recently as a few years ago. The opportunities to serve are enormous, as are the challenges, and it is important that J.P. Morgan’s coverage model conform to this global paradigm. I’ve asked Jeff Urwin to become head of Global Investment Banking Coverage, Capital Markets and M&amp;A. Jeff is a highly experienced banker, manager and leader, and he has played a pivotal role in building our Americas investment banking franchise over the past three years. In his new capacity, Jeff will work closely with the regional banking heads to coordinate coverage worldwide, to further integrate the disciplined approach to balance sheet and capital management that is a company hallmark, and to ensure that the right tools and resources are in place to support our bankers as their client franchise evolves. Kevin Willsey will remain co-head of North America Investment Banking. Kevin led J.P.

Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s firm, said on Friday that he had filed a revised lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, demanding a minimum of $19 billion in damages.Mr. Picard had sought $5.4 billion in damages previously in addition to $1 billion in transfers and claims. JPMorgan “was an active enabler of the Madoff Ponzi scheme,” David Sheehan, Mr. Picard’s lawyer, said in a statement. JPMorgan officials “not only should have known that a fraud was being perpetrated, they did know,” he said. Mr. Picard, who has filed 1,000 lawsuits, claiming $90 billion for Madoff investors, first sued JPMorgan in bankruptcy court in December, contending it ignored signs of fraud as billions of dollars flowed from Mr. Madoff’s account at the bank to investors. JPMorgan was Mr. Madoff’s primary banker. The lawsuit sought $1 billion in fees and transfers, and $5.4 billion in damages, contending that JPMorgan defrauded federal regulators and violated banking law. The amended complaint makes additional allegations, including that two former employees of an unidentified financial institution observed “nearly daily circular transactions” between an account that Mr. Madoff controlled at their employer and his account at JPMorgan. After raising questions about the transactions, the financial institution closed the account because it saw no legitimate business purpose for the transactions, according to the complaint. The amended complaint also includes a request for a jury trial. A JPMorgan spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti, has said the bank complied fully with all laws and regulations. JPMorgan has sought dismissal of the case, arguing that Mr. Picard was hired to liquidate the Madoff firm and has no legal right to mount a class action and claim damages for the Ponzi scheme’s investors.Irving H.

The agency accused Mr. Steffelin of misleading investors into believing that a unit of the firm he worked for, the GSC Capital Corporation, had selected the mortgage securities in the investment portfolio. Instead, the S.E.C. said, a hedge fund named Magnetar Capital chose the assets. A lawyer for Mr. Steffelin said he intended to fight the charges. The settlement comes after a $550 million agreement the S.E.C. reached with Goldman Sachs last year to resolve similar claims. Investors harmed in the JPMorgan transaction, known as Squared CDO 2007-I, will receive all of their money back, according to the S.E.C., a total of $125.87 million. JPMorgan also voluntarily paid $56.76 million to some investors in a separate transaction known as Tahoma CDO I, a similar deal in which investors lost money. The S.E.C. did not bring any action related to Tahoma. “We believe this settlement resolves all outstanding S.E.C. inquiries into J.P. Morgan’s C.D.O. business,” Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan Chase spokesman, said in a statement. In settling the case, the company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. JPMorgan said it sustained losses of $900 million related to Squared CDO. The case is part of a raft of litigation stemming from the mortgage crisis. The S.E.C. is still investigating accusations of improper sales practices at Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and several other companies. In addition, the New York State attorney general recently opened a number of cases involving several big banks as part of a broad sweep of Wall Street’s loan packaging business. Private investors are looking to recoup some of their losses in the courts. There are still about $200 billion in private legal claims over mortgage securities against major banks, according to Institutional Risk Analytics. In the JPMorgan case, the S.E.C. asserted that the bank undertook “an aggressive effort” in 2007 to unload the securities on investors outside its usual circle of customers for deals involving collateralized debt obligations. In one e-mail on March 22, 2007, the JPMorgan employee in charge of the sales effort wrote, “We are soooo pregnant with this deal, we need a wheel-barrel to move around. ... Let’s schedule the cesarian, please!” The S.E.C. also cited numerous JPMorgan e-mails noting Magnetar’s involvement in the selection. But no executives, traders or salesmen from JPMorgan were accused of wrongdoing. That contrasts with the case the S.E.C. brought against Goldman Sachs last year. That case also accused a trader at Goldman, Fabrice Tourre, who is fighting the claims. Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement, said in a conference call with reporters that the decision not to take action against any JPMorgan executive was based on the evidence in the case. “We look hard at the conduct of individuals,” Mr. Khuzami said. “First and foremost, you have to show that an individual is aware that information is not being disclosed, that it is material and that they knew the facts.” Those elements were present in the company’s conduct, he said. “What JPMorgan failed to tell investors was that a prominent hedge fund that would financially profit from the failure of the C.D.O. portfolio assets heavily influenced the C.D.O. portfolio selection,” he said. The S.E.C. previously notified at least one other individual — Michael Llodra, the former head of structured C.D.O.’s at JPMorgan — that he might be sued for his role in marketing such securities. And Magnetar has been involved with multiple C.D.O.’s arranged by other brokerage firms. Mr. Khuzami declined to comment on whether any other such cases were still proceeding. 1 2 Next Page » Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.WASHINGTON — JPMorgan Chase has agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle federal civil accusations that it misled investors in a complex mortgage securities transaction in 2007, just as the housing market was beginning to plummet, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/jpmorgan-pays-153-million-to-settle-mortgage-case/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Pays $153 Million to Settle Mortgage Case<date>June 21, 2011, 2:05 pm</date><text>Mark Lennihan/Associated Press The Securities and Exchange Commission said JPMorgan Chase failed to disclose that a hedge fund helped create an investment marketed by the bank while also betting that the deal would fail. JPMorgan Chase has agreed to pay $153 million to settle allegations that it misled investors when it marketed a risky mortgage investment shortly before the housing market collapsed. The case is one of the largest, and most significant, legal actions against a Wall Street bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday accused JPMorgan of securities fraud, saying the bank failed to disclose that a hedge fund helped create the mortgage investment while also betting that the deal would fail. When it did collapse, investors lost more than $100 million on the deal. The investors included a religious nonprofit group in Minneapolis, several Asian financial institutions and General Motors Asset Management, which manages the General Motors pension plans. Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, testified in February 2009 before the House Financial Services Committee. The case closely mirrors the S.E.C.’s biggest enforcement matter in recent memory — the 2010 action against Goldman Sachs, which was accused of selling a mortgage investment that was intended to collapse. In that case, the hedge fund giant John Paulson had helped create — and bet against — a mortgage investment sold by Goldman. The bank agreed to settle the case for $500 million. The S.E.C.’s case against JPMorgan focused on a collateralized debt obligation by the name of Squared CDO 2007-1. The hedge fund Magnetar Capital played a “significant role” in assembling the portfolio and was “poised to benefit” from its demise, according to the S.E.C. In an internal e-mail, a JPMorgan employee said, “We all know [Magnetar] wants to print as many deals as possible before everything completely falls apart,” according to the S.E.C. In recent months, the S.E.C. has been examining the relationship between other Wall Street firms and Magnetar, which has not been accused of any wrongdoing. JPMorgan is the first to settle. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The S.E.C. press release “JPMorgan marketed highly-complex CDO investments to investors with promises that the mortgage assets underlying the CDO would be selected by an independent manager looking out for investor interests,” Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, said in a statement. “What J.P. Morgan failed to tell investors was that a prominent hedge fund that would financially profit from the failure of CDO portfolio assets heavily influenced the CDO portfolio selection.” In a statement, JPMorgan said it “sustained losses of nearly $900 million in connection with” the investment. “We believe this settlement resolves all outstanding S.E.C. inquiries into JPMorgan’s C.D.O. business,” said Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman. The bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement. The S.E.C.’s case against JPMorgan centers on the marketing materials for the Squared C.D.O. deal. The materials stated that the investment advisory arm of the GSC Capital Corporation assembled the portfolio. The documents failed to mention that Magnetar selected many of the assets and bet against the deal. The Squared deal’s ultimate demise can be traced to the souring housing market. In early March 2007, JPMorgan executives were notified that the bank had already lost $40 billion on the portfolio. So in March and April of 2007, JPMorgan “launched a frantic global sales effort” to unload the deal, the S.E.C. said in a statement. The bank sought out a range of unlikely customers, including Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit life insurance group that acquired a $10 million stake in Squared. On March 22, 2007, the JPMorgan employee who was distributing the deal said in an e-mail that “we are so pregnant with this deal…Let’s schedule the cesarian (sic), please!” By early 2008, the securities were nearly worthless. Investors lost most of their money, totaling some $125 million. Magnetar, however, fared far better. When the Squared CDO deal closed in May 2007, Magnetar, based in Illinois, held a $600 million bet against the portfolio. In a statement, Magnetar said it is “not a party to the settlement nor a defendant in this case, and was not involved in the marketing of the securities.” Under the settlement with the S.E.C., JPMorgan agreed to reimburse the investors and change the way it reviews mortgage deals. The S.E.C. also filed a complaint on Tuesday against a GSC employee who helped create the Squared CDO and draft the marketing materials. S.E.C. v. J.P.

Chip Cards for Travelers<date>June 20, 2011, 4:18 pm</date><text>U.S. Bank is joining the small-but-growing ranks of American financial institutions offering credit cards with tiny, secure microprocessing chips that are widely used overseas. But U.S. Bank’s card, aiming for maximum flexibility, uses technology that lets the card work with three different payment systems. The bank, the main banking unit of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, says its FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa card offers the embedded E.M.V. (for Europay, Mastercard and Visa) chips, which are becoming prevalent in Europe, as well as the older magnetic stripe technology, which is still dominant in the United States. The U.S. Bank card also can be used in “contactless” payment systems available at some locations in the United States. These systems let the customer wave the card at a payment terminal to make a purchase, rather than sliding it through a reader at checkout. That’s a lot of technology sitting in a little plastic rectangle. The bank says that will allow its customers to have the “best experience possible wherever they go.” “While we believe E.M.V. is important for our international travel cardholders, we are committed to driving contactless mobile payments in the United States,” said Cliff Cook, chief marketing officer for the bank’s retail payments unit, in a press release. Roughly 20,000 FlexPerks Visa cardholders will get the new cards this month. The bank plans to expand the card to other travel reward cardholders in the coming year. E.M.V. technology is considered more secure than magnetic stripes and is widely used in Europe. Some American cardholders have had trouble using their magnetic stripe cards abroad, particularly at unattended kiosks used to sell train tickets and the like, as this Practical Traveler column discussed. The cards have been slow to catch on in the United States, in part because of the expense merchants will incur to install new, compatible card readers at their registers. Recently, some big banks—Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase—as well as some smaller credit unions have introduced cards with E.M.V chips for customers who travel internationally. Chase has said it will expand its E.M.V. offerings in the coming months, and on Monday it introduced a second E.M.V. card, JPMorgan Select Visa Signature® card. Unlike some versions of E.M.V. cards, which require a PIN, Chase’s smart-chip cards use a signature, but you don’t have to sign at unmanned kiosks, according to the bank.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/business/media/20carr.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Book Reveals Ugly Details of Press Deals<date>Published: June 19, 2011</date><text>Any look behind the curtain of Wall Street is not going to be pretty. But there is not pretty and then there is plain ugly.James O’Shea, the former editor in chief of The Los Angeles Times, found a classic of the genre in the course of reporting out “The Deal From Hell: How Moguls and Wall Street Plundered Great American Newspapers,” his deep dive into the two deals that tipped over the companies that owned, among many other newspapers, The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. Here’s the capsule version: in 2000, The Tribune Company, owner of the Tribune and many other papers, bought The Times-Mirror Company, owner of The Los Angeles Times, for a then-record $8.3 billion. The merger never yielded much in the way of synergy, and the combined company put itself in play in 2007, when there were few buyers left. Enter Sam Zell, a real estate tycoon with a fondness for distressed assets, who took over the business with the help of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan that saddled The Tribune with $13 billion in debt. The company is now mired in a two-year, hugely expensive bankruptcy. That’s all known. What Mr. O’Shea focused on was how the bankers — who he said should have known the deal would render the company insolvent — seemed to be too busy counting their fees to care. Here’s a note he found buried deep in court records from Jieun Choi, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, that demonstrated a breathtaking level of cynicism and self-dealing: “There is wide speculation that [Tribune] might have so much debt that all of its assets aren’t gonna cover the debt in case of (knock-knock) you know what,” she wrote to a colleague, in a not very veiled reference to bankruptcy. “Well that’s what we are saying, too. But we’re doing this ‘cause it’s enough to cover our bank debt. So, lesson learned from this deal: our (here I mean JPM’s) business strategy for TRB but probably not only limited to TRB is ‘hit and run.’ ” She then went on to explain just how far a bank will go to “suck $$$ out of the (dying or dead?) client’s pocket” in terms that are too graphic to be repeated here or most anywhere else. The court-appointed bankruptcy examiner, Kenneth Klee, was skeptical of her ability to make such a judgment, saying, “Choi’s e-mail reflects a misunderstanding by a junior analyst who failed to understand the nature and purpose of the analysis she was asked to perform.” Mr. Klee sought to interview her, but she declined and has since returned to her native Korea. Mr. O’Shea said her e-mail reflected an overall mentality that was pervasive among the banks. JPMorgan ran the deal, but other banks, including Citibank and Bank of America, took part. There were two separate rounds of financing to raise the approximately $12 billion that Mr. Zell borrowed to take the Tribune Company private. The banks received an eye-popping $161 million in fees for just the first round — a number sufficient to run The Los Angeles Times newsroom for a year, as Mr. O’Shea points out — and a total of $283 million in fees for both rounds. He also reports that Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan, expressed some doubts about the fundamentals of the deal based on his firm’s analysis, but ultimately the bank decided to keep Mr. Zell’s business. JPMorgan was a substantial lender in the deal as well, lending hundreds of millions of dollars, and will share in the pain of the bankruptcy. JPMorgan’s lawyers declined to comment, but the bank has said in the past that both it and Mr. Dimon were obligated by contracts signed during Phase 1 of the lending, and that they did so based on a solvency opinion that later came into dispute. Mr. O’Shea said in a phone call that he “was stunned by how this small group of powerful bankers, all of whom seemed to know each other, lined up to get Mr. Zell’s business. Like him, they didn’t know much about the news business, but they were basically doing billion-dollar loans with a wink and nod.” 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2nAny look behind the curtain of Wall Street is not going to be pretty.

One JPMorgan employee said he had heard that the bank’s chief executive was running with the rank and file. Another had heard Mr. Dimon was at the starting line, sporting the red bibs reserved for the fastest racers. As it turns out, Mr. Dimon was holed up at the bank’s Park Avenue offices for a paperwork marathon ahead of a whirlwind business trip across Asia. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink More than 1,200 JPMorgan employees turned out to run the 3.5-mile course, with many running as part of teams sponsored by the various groups inside the investment bank and asset management division. They were joined by more than 15,000 runners from 467 Wall Street banks, hedge funds, law firms and other businesses in the New York metropolitan area. This year, JPMorgan will sponsor corporate challenge races in 12 major cities around the world. A second race in Central Park is scheduled for Thursday evening Almost as spirited as the race itself was the competition for the best corporate T-shirts. Pret A Manger, the sandwich shop, and Ciardullo Associates, an architecture and planning firm, took home top honors. But Holland &amp; Knight, the venerable law firm, deserved acknowledgment for one of the more humorous slogans. “Slow down,” their T-shirts read. “We charge by the hour.” JPMorgan employees, meanwhile, felt that they got the last laugh because one of the requirements was that all race T-shirts had to be emblazoned with the JPMorgan corporate challenge logo. That meant the gang at Goldman Sachs had to give a nod to one of their main rivals as they crossed the finish line. “We were proud to participate in JPMorgan’s corporate challenge,” said David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman. Gian-Paul Caccia of Wolverine Trading, a high-frequency trading firm, won the corporate challenge for the second year in a row with a time of 17:05 minutes, according to the unofficial results. Emily Mareb of Bloomingdales was the fastest female racer, with a time of 21:02 minutes. Inside the JPMorgan hospitality tent, colleagues pointed out that Mary Callahan Erdoes, the head of the bank’s asset management division, had claimed top honors in the race last year. Ms. Erdoes, 43, clarified: “for my age group,” Hobbled by a running injury, Ms. Erdoes took in this year’s race from the sidelines — on crutches. But she was forced to high-tail it earlier in the day when CNBC camera operator followed her along Park Avenue as she walked to a pitch meeting for the initial public offering of the Carlyle Group, the private equity firm.

Conrad/The New York TimesCharles W. Scharf. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has a reputation as a ruthless boss. But in his deftly orchestrated management shake-up on Tuesday, he showed he could also be compassionate. Mr. Dimon, who was unceremoniously ousted at Citigroup, went to great lengths to frame the reassignment of Charles W. Scharf, the head of Chase Retail Financial Services, to an internal private equity group as anything but a demotion. Both Mr. Scharf and Mr. Dimon said the job switch was amicable, and that Mr. Scharf had requested the change. Over the last year, the two said that they had several conversations in which Mr. Scharf had expressed interest in doing something entrepreneurial. At One Equity Partners, Mr. Scharf will be one of 15 executives who invest in a wide range of manufacturing, industrial and technology companies. He will report to Dick Cashin, the head of the unit. “I feel great about it,” Mr. Scharf said. “It gives me time to think and do other things.” Mr. Dimon, for his part, framed the move as a natural step. “It’s no different than a lot of people going to private equity shops,” Mr. Dimon said. “It just happens to be here.” Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links A Big Shake-Up at JPMorgan DealBook's 2008 profile of Charles Scharf But few in and outside the bank see it as anything but a comedown. Many were surprised that Mr. Scharf lasted as long as he did, given the myriad problems facing the mortgage business. Mr. Scharf will go from leading one of the bank’s biggest businesses to being an ordinary executive in its often overlooked private equity group. He will also give up his seat on the bank’s so-called operating committee of its 15 highest-ranking executives. And after years of being viewed as a successor to Mr. Dimon, the move almost certainly takes him out of the running. That Mr. Scharf’s responsibilities will now be split among three of Mr. Dimon’s most trusted lieutenants is also an acknowledgment that the job may have become too big for one person to manage. In the boom times, making money in retail banking and mortgage business was relatively easy. Today, as new regulations dampen revenue and the loan losses and legal inquiries mount, it is a lot harder. Todd Maclin, who won high marks for steering Chase’s commercial bank through the crisis with minimal losses, will take on additional responsibilities overseeing the bank’s branch network and small-business banking operations. Gordon A. Smith, the head of Chase Card Services, will add the auto finance and student lending units to his portfolio, as well as oversee Chase’s overall branding efforts In February, Frank J. Bisignano, the bank’s chief administrative officer known for his operations know-how, was given the additional task of turning around Chase’s troubled mortgage unit. On Tuesday, David J. Lowman, whose duties he absorbed, was dismissed. But Mr. Dimon took pains to make sure that Mr. Scharf, who was viewed very much as his protégé, had a much softer landing than when he was ousted at Citigroup. The firing, by Mr. Dimon’s longtime mentor Sanford I. Weill, was one of the few public embarrassments in an otherwise sterling career. Indeed, Mr. Scharf has been part of Mr. Dimon’s inner circle since for years. Mr. Scharf started out as Mr. Dimon’s assistant after graduating from college in 1987, and then then rose through the ranks alongside him as they turned a tiny Baltimore consumer lender into the financial supermarket that was Citigroup. Then, when Mr. Dimon was forced out there, Mr. Scharf followed him to Bank One, where he was put in charge of turning around the troubled regional bank’s retail operations. Mr. Scharf then did the same thing at Chase, when Mr. Dimon took over in 2004. At Chase, Mr. Scharf helped engineer several deals to vastly expand Chase’s footprint, including the takeover of Washington Mutual during the 2008 financial crisis that brought its total branches to more than 5,300. But the bank’s aggressive push into push into home equity and mortgage lending caused one headache after the next. When the housing market collapsed, Chase started spilling red ink. Mr. Dimon has said extraordinary high levels of losses will temper the bank’s results for years. The troubles also resulted in a flurry of legal inquiries. Along with several other large mortgage servicers, Chase is negotiating a settlement with the state attorneys general and regulators over lax foreclosure practices. Mr. Dimon called the improper foreclosures of military veterans the worst mistake that the bank has ever made. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Dimon said that Mr. Scharf’s reassignment was not related to the mortgage troubles and called him a “friend and trusted adviser.” Still, he conceded that Mr. Scharf might find not reporting to him a relief. “I think he is looking forward to not working for me,” he joked. Here are the internal memos Mr. Dimon sent on Tuesday: I am pleased to announce today new responsibilities for a number of senior leaders in our consumer businesses. Charlie Scharf, CEO of Retail Financial Services, will become a Partner in One Equity Partners (OEP), our private equity arm. A year ago, Charlie came to me and expressed his desire to do something new and entrepreneurial here at the company. Charlie has been a valued colleague and trusted friend, and I am thrilled that he will take on a senior role in our OEP unit. Working closely with OEP head Dick Cashin, Charlie’s years of senior operating experience and financial expertise will be extremely valuable to our private equity franchise. Charlie has played a critical role in building our Retail franchise into one of the top players in the industry, successfully integrating the Bank One, Chase, Bank of New York and Washington Mutual businesses and helping expand our branch footprint across the country. In addition to his OEP role, Charlie will continue to work with our consumer team to help transition the business and assist in any way possible. Todd Maclin, head of the Commercial Bank, will assume additional responsibilities for the company’s Retail business, including the branch network, consumer franchise, small business banking and our Chase private client business. He will continue as CEO of the Commercial Bank. Todd has done an exceptional job running the Commercial Bank over the past several years during an extremely challenging time. He has been a great partner with our Retail team and has successfully optimized the branch network to expand our industry-leading commercial bank. Frank Bisignano, Chief Administrative Officer and Head of Home Lending, will continue in both of these roles, reporting to me. Gordon Smith, CEO of Card Services, will also take on responsibility for our Auto Finance and Student Lending businesses, in addition to his current role. Marc Sheinbaum will continue to manage the auto finance and student lending businesses and will now report to Gordon. To better leverage the power of the Chase brand and ensure more consistency, Gordon will take on a new role managing all Chase-branded marketing across our Chase products and services. In this role, he’ll work closely with Jay Mandelbaum and the senior marketers in each of the businesses. We are fortunate to have such a strong management team here at the company. These changes reflect our ongoing commitment to focusing on the development of our leaders and providing them with diversified opportunities and experience across the company. Charlie, Todd, Frank and Gordon are exceptional executives and partners who play a key role in our firm’s success. Please join me in wishing them well in these important roles. Jamie To: All Employees From: Jamie Dimon Date: June 14, 2011 Subject: Heidi Miller to retire in early 2012 as we complete transformation of our international organization structure Dear Colleagues – Following a 30+ year career in banking and finance – much of which was with JPMorgan Chase – Heidi Miller has decided to retire from the firm in early 2012. Over these years, Heidi has established herself as one of the great leaders in our industry, taking on a number of key roles, including Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup and Bank One, a member of our Bank One Board of Directors and other large corporate boards, CEO of our Treasury &amp; Securities Services business, and most recently, President of International. During her years at JPMorgan Chase, she has been a valued member of our Operating Committee and a trusted advisor to me. Heidi’s achievements outside our company – spearheading philanthropic causes, strengthening our communities and helping others – are among her proudest and most important accomplishments. We will miss her greatly and wish Heidi all the best in whatever she chooses to do next. Just over a year ago, I asked Heidi to take on the role of President of our International operations – advising our business lines around the world on how best to accelerate and prioritize their efforts and their investments for growth. We already possessed world-class wholesale businesses internationally, but we knew we could do better. Working with her senior colleagues, Heidi helped develop comprehensive and coordinated growth plans and a governance structure that built upon the LOB business strategies. She furthered our efforts in expanding the ranks of our global corporate bankers, and she helped us do a better job of deepening and coordinating our client coverage efforts across multiple lines of business around the world. Jes Staley, CEO of our Investment Bank, will assume additional responsibility for overseeing and coordinating our international efforts across all of our businesses. This is an important next step, as it integrates our focus on international with our decision making around local markets, clients and people within the lines of business. Importantly, Jes will partner closely with the CEOs of our other wholesale international businesses – Mike Cavanagh in Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Mary Erdoes in Asset Management – as well as with our Corporate groups around the world. Jes will concentrate on ensuring that our wholesale products and businesses, wherever they sit globally, are receiving the investments, the people, the focus and the prioritization that they need to be successful. Given the importance of international, which makes up nearly 25% of our firm-wide revenues, we will dedicate significant time at each of our monthly Operating Committee meetings to focus on our international business priorities, growth agenda and progress. Our three regional CEOs – Gaby Abdelnour, CEO of the Asia-Pacific region, Daniel Pinto, who is becoming CEO of the EMEA (Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa) region, and Nicolas (Gucho) Aguzin, CEO of Latin America – will regularly join these monthly sessions. In addition, other members of the International Steering Committee will join these meetings when appropriate.

But amid an effort to repair its mortgage business and restructure its international activities, Mr. Dimon moved aside two of his most loyal lieutenants while elevating three top managers he did not even know before coming to JPMorgan in 2004. In an interview, Mr. Dimon framed the changes as part of his effort to groom several senior executives but played down the impact of the moves in the bank’s closely watched succession race. At 55, Mr. Dimon expressed no intentions of leaving. “Management changes take place when they take place,” he said. But inside JPMorgan’s Park Avenue offices, rumors of a coming management shake-up had been swirling for months — especially as the problems in its mortgage unit worsened. Some see this shake-up as part of Mr. Dimon’s plans to clean up that business.   Charles W. Scharf, who stepped down as the head of Chase’s mortgage and retail banking operations, will become a partner in its One Equity Partners, the bank’s tiny private equity group. Mr. Scharf, hired by Mr. Dimon out of college in the late 1980s, followed him to Citigroup and Bank One and was considered a potential successor. “It’s no different than a lot of people going to private equity shops,” Mr. Dimon claimed. “It just happens to be here.” Mr. Scharf’s duties will be absorbed by other members of Mr. Dimon’s leadership team. Todd Maclin, the head of Chase’s commercial bank, will take on additional responsibilities overseeing the bank’s branch network and small-business banking operations. Gordon A. Smith, the head of Chase Card Services, will add the auto finance and student lending units to his portfolio, as well as oversee the consumer bank’s branding efforts. Neither was part of Mr. Dimon’s inner circle, but earned his trust with their strong performance during the crisis. David Lowman, the head of the bank’s mortgage unit who reported to Mr. Scharf, was dismissed on Tuesday, according to an internal memorandum. His exit had been telegraphed earlier this year when Frank J. Bisignano, the bank’s chief administrative officer, was given the additional responsibility of supervising Chase’s mortgage operations. Mr. Dimon also announced that Heidi Miller, another executive who worked alongside Mr. Dimon since their days at Citigroup, would retire from the company in early 2012. James E. Staley, the head of JPMorgan’s investment bank, will take over her duties coordinating the bank’s expansion plans in faster-growing markets overseas. Mr. Staley’s promotion was also one of an executive who did not start out in Mr. Dimon’s inner circle. The reorganization almost certainly will turn attention to the race to identify a successor for Mr. Dimon. Mr. Staley, who has had a string of success running JPMorgan’s investment bank and the asset management division, has been viewed as the most likely immediate choice, although at 54, he is only a few months younger than Mr. Dimon. A younger corps of executives, most in their 40s, is also on the list, including Michael J. Cavanagh, the bank’s former finance chief who now runs treasury services; Matthew E. Zames, the head of fixed income in the investment bank; Mary Erdoes, the head of asset management; and Douglas L. Braunstein, the chief financial officer. The job switch for Mr. Scharf, once considered a charter member of that club, could take him out of the running. Although Mr. Scharf helped engineer several deals to expand Chase’s footprint, including the takeover of Washington Mutual during the 2008 financial crisis, an overly aggressive expansion into home equity and mortgage lending swamped the business with losses. Improper foreclosure practices have drawn fire from Washington, and were one of Mr. Dimon’s rare missteps. Mr. Dimon said Mr. Scharf had asked to do something entrepreneurial and completely different a year ago. “I think he is looking forward to not working for me,” he joked.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, removed the head of the bank’s consumer banking business and reshuffled several other top executives in the biggest shake-up of his management team since the financial crisis.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF153FF937A25755C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">DEALBOOK; Two Views Of the Value Of Bank Rules<date>Published: June 14, 2011</date><text>Jamie Dimon is frustrated. In a surprisingly public demonstration of his aggravation, Mr. Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, unloaded last week on Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, critically questioning the government's efforts to regulate the banking industry. ''I have this great fear that someone's going to write a book in 10 or 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the things that we did in the middle of a crisis that actually slowed down recovery,'' he told Mr. Bernanke at a televised meeting of bankers in Atlanta, ticking off a laundry list of new regulations like higher capital requirements and a tax on systemically important financial institutions. ''Do you have a fear like I do that when we will look back and look at them all, that they will be the reason it took so long'' for our banks, our credit and our businesses and ''most importantly job creation'' to get going again?, he asked Mr. Bernanke. ''Is this holding us back?'' His question, which was quickly cheered by traders on Wall Street, was dismissed by some in Washington and on Main Street as self-serving propaganda from a chief executive seeking less regulation and higher profits. ''I see a lot of amnesia setting in now,'' Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told me during a conversation at the Council on Foreign Relations two days after Mr. Dimon's comments. ''On obvious things like higher capital standards, I say full speed ahead and the higher the better.'' Making a veiled dig at Mr. Dimon, she added, ''banks are not doing a lot of lending now, and the ones that are doing the better job of lending are the smaller institutions that have the higher capital levels.'' Nearly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the prevailing wisdom is that we need tighter regulations to avoid another crisis. It's a popular view, one that this column has long supported. After all, if we don't adopt tougher standards now, then when? I called Mr. Dimon, in part, to challenge his view. But I was somewhat taken aback by his response, which was far more nuanced than his seeming diatribe to the Fed chairman. ''My point wasn't that we shouldn't regulate the industry,'' he said. ''But we should think twice about how exactly we're doing it and the cumulative impact of the changes if the main goal is to help create jobs.'' The more restrictions put on banks, he said, the less lending and financing of businesses that will take place. To him, it's simple arithmetic. ''I want job growth like everybody else,'' he said. The problem, he contends is ''we're trying to do two very different things at the same time,'' referring to regulating the industry and stimulating the economy. ''I would stop trying to solve every perceived problem at once,'' he added. ''The highest and most important thing we can do right now is to get the economy growing and adding jobs.'' It's easy to dismiss Mr. Dimon as another banker crying wolf. His firm has vigorously lobbied to prevent the Federal Reverse from raising capital ratios to 10 percent from 7 percent, fearful it will crimp lending - and probably profits (and yes, compensation.) But it's also an uncomfortable truth that Mr. Dimon should be taken seriously, at least his suggestion that policy makers can't predict the full impact of the coming regulation. ''Jamie Dimon is right that it only makes sense to look at the effects of financial regulation holistically,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University, and the co-author of ''This Time is Different,'' which looked at financial crises over several centuries. When Mr. Bernanke answered Mr. Dimon's question, he said, ''Has anybody done a comprehensive analysis of the impact on credit? I can't pretend that anybody really has. You know, it's just too complicated. We don't really have the quantitative tools to do that.'' That was an unsatisfying answer and an uncomfortable truth, too. Indeed, Mr. Dimon may be right: Strict regulation could hamper the recovery in the short term. But his comments also raise a larger policy and political question: Can we afford to risk another collapse of the financial system - even if it doesn't happen for another 100 years - by going lighter on regulation today? It's an idea, by the way, that is very hard for regular Joes to swallow. Mr. Rogoff, whom Mr. Dimon has often cited, isn't so sure it is that black and white. ''My instinct is that the Fed must be right to push for raising capital requirements from 7 to 10 percent,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''Switzerland has already committed to the higher capital route and rather than hurting their banks, it might even have given them a competitive advantage, especially given the dodgy state of many European bank balance sheets.'' Other academic studies have come to similar conclusions. Anat R. Admati of Stanford University wrote a compelling report, ''Fallacies, Irrelevant Facts and Myths in the Discussion of Capital Regulation: Why Bank Equity is Not Expensive'' that suggests that raising capital requirements is not as dangerous or costly as some on Wall Street believe. Still, Mr. Rogoff acknowledged, ''I don't see a big need to rush to raise capital requirements. If history tells us anything, it is that having a deep financial crisis is the best vaccine against having another one, at least for awhile.'' In a perfect, less politicized world, perhaps we could follow Mr. Dimon's advice and wait to increase regulation until the economy is on steadier footing. (It's worth noting that most of the Fed's proposed rules and requirements already would be phased in over time.) But will bankers - or even regulators and lawmakers - think the industry needs new rules when the economy and the job market are in full-on growth mode? After all, the financial system only gets tested in times of crisis - at which point regulation comes too late. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.42 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 12,124.36. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index rose 9.44 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,289.00. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.49 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,684.87. The gains ended a six-day losing streak and were the first time stocks rose in June. Stocks had dropped after poor reports on manufacturing, home sales, hiring and consumer confidence. It was the longest losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average in more than a year and the longest for the S.&amp; P. since February 2009. The market’s weeklong slump also made stocks appear relatively cheap, Mr. Chan said. The S.&amp; P. 500-stock index lost 6.2 percent over the previous six days of trading. “Markets usually swing like a pendulum,” Mr. Chan said. “This decline has been strong enough that you can easily justify the market taking a breath.” The narrower trade deficit is a sign that goods from manufacturers in the United States are becoming more competitive overseas. United States companies sold more computers, heavy machinery and telecommunications equipment abroad in April compared with March. Imports declined because fewer cars were bought from Japan after factories there were damaged by an earthquake and tsunami. Companies that make farming machinery rose after the government reported that United States corn crops would be smaller this fall. That sent corn prices soaring and raised expectations that farm owners would buy more tractors and other agricultural equipment. Deere &amp; Company and AGCO rose 2.5 percent. A report on claims for unemployment benefits was in line with expectations that new applications would stay about the same. The Labor Department reported that new claims edged up 1,000 to 427,000. Economists had expected a slight decline. The high level of claims still suggests that the job market is slow. The Interpublic Group of Companies, the advertising concern, rose 6.4 percent, the most of any company in the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index, after Moody’s raised its rating on the company. A jump in oil prices sent energy stocks higher. Energy companies in the S.&amp; P. 500-index rose 1.2 percent. Crude rose $1.19 to settle at $101.93. Stocks have been slipping since mid-April on concern that the nation’s economy has hit a soft patch. Oil prices, Japan’s tsunami and nuclear disaster and the risk that Greece might default on debt have led investors to reduce forecasts for growth in the United States this year. Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.00 percent from 2.95 percent late Wednesday.A report that United States exports hit a record high in April sent stocks sharply higher Thursday as investors hoped the economic recovery might not be as sluggish as suggested by the grim economic reports issued over the last week.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/what-dimon-told-bernanke/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">What Dimon Told Bernanke<date>June 8, 2011, 8:34 am</date><text>You have probably heard that Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, on Tuesday questioned Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, over whether banking regulation had gone too far and was hurting the economy. Business Insider proclaims Mr. Dimon as “Wall Street’s new hero.” Mr. Bernanke was speaking before an audience of bankers, including Mr. Dimon, in Atlanta. So what was the exchange? Here is an excerpt: Mr. Dimon: Y’know, I have this, totally, I completely agree that we had a crisis and that it entailed doing a lot of things to fix and reduce risk. I have this great fear that someone’s going to write a book in 10 or 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the things that we did in the middle of a crisis that actually slowed down recovery. … Now we’re told there could be even higher capital requirements, so-called SIFI and G-SIFI charges [global systemically important financial institutions ], etc., and we know there are 300 rules coming. Has anyone bothered to study the cumulative effect of all these things, and do you have a fear like I do that when we will look back and look at them all, that they will be the reason it took so long that our banks, our credit and our businesses — most importantly, job creation isn’t going again. is this holding us back? Mr. Bernanke: This is certainly the most comprehensive reform since the 1930s and we’re trying to execute it and trying to address all of the problems, and you didn’t mention three or four others I could think of. So, yes. it was a big problem. It has a huge impact. … So there are many, many things to fix. We’re working on them and making, I hope, a lot of progress. Has anybody done a comprehensive analysis of the impact on credit? i can’t pretend that anybody really has. You know, it’s just too complicated. We don’t really have the quantitative tools to do that. … We are trying to develop rules that make sense, that are consistent with good practice, but which do not unnecessarily impose costs, or unnecessarily constrict credit.

The deal, which was announced on Wednesday morning, would add to WellPoint’s already dominant position in California, Arizona and Nevada, where the privately held CareMore provides managed care to about 54,000 elderly people. “The Medicare market is particularly significant for WellPoint’s growth strategy,” Angela F. Braly, chairwoman and chief executive of WellPoint, said in a statement. “We anticipate that more than one million Baby Boomers will age into Medicare every year between now and 2030 across our 14 Blue states.” WellPoint, which holds the license for Blue Cross in California and for Blue Cross Blue Shield in about a dozen other states, is the largest American health insurer in terms of patients covered. CareMore, based in Downey, Calif., is owned by CCMP, the New York private equity firm. CCMP, formerly JPMorgan Partners, acquired the business in 2006. The firm is expected to earn about five times its original investment in the company, people familiar with the deal’s terms said. WellPoint expects the acquisition to increase earnings per share by 2013. The transaction should turn heads in the deal world because health care mergers and acquisitions have slowed as a result of the uncertainty surrounding President Obama’s health care overhaul and its effect on the managed care sector, especially Medicare organizations.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/jpmorgan-hires-former-united-airlines-c-e-o/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Hires Former United Airlines Chief<date>June 6, 2011, 10:42 am</date><text>Glenn F. Tilton, a former chief executive of United Airlines, has been named chairman of JPMorgan Chase‘s Midwest business, succeeding William M. Daley, who left the bank this year to become White House chief of staff. Mr. Tilton, 63, will also be a member of the bank’s executive committee. The former airline and oil company executive started interviewing for the spot in early spring and has since met with “virtually all the top team at JPMorgan,” Mr. Tilton said in an interview. “The timing is important because we hope we’re in the beginning of a legitimate recovery and the Midwest is imperative to that recovery.” As the bank’s top official in the Midwest, Mr. Tilton will focus on “building and strengthening the firm’s business and brand” in Chicago and neighboring cities, according to a JPMorgan statement. On Monday, his first day at the bank, Mr. Tilton will dine with some 75 business leaders in Chicago.

Although Chicago is the business hub of the Midwest, Mr. Tilton plans to branch out the bank’s lending operations across the region. “We have an opportunity to expand outside of Chicago,” he said. “We have to consider how best to position the image of the bank.” Mr. Tilton will be charged with recruiting talent to join the bank’s Chicago office, although he said he had no immediate plans for hiring. He also will be the bank’s liaison with public officials in the area, a familiar role for Mr. Tilton. As the longtime leader of United, which is based in Chicago, he has developed close relationships with local officials, including Chicago’s new mayor, Rahm Emanuel. He also is no stranger to JPMorgan. Over the last several years, Mr. Tilton has been among the bank’s top corporate clients. Still, a transition into the banking world is a significant change for him. Although he has experience working with investment bankers, he acknowledged that he needed to learn the retail banking side of the firm. For now, he will remain nonexecutive chairman of United Continental Holdings Inc., the combined venture between United Airlines and Continental Airlines. Mr. Tilton steered the company through the merger, as well as the airline industry’s largest-ever bankruptcy. United filed for bankruptcy in 2002, soon after Mr. Tilton became chief executive and chairman. Before joining United, Mr. Tilton was chairman and chief executive Texaco as well as interim chairman of Dynegy.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/barclays-names-co-heads-for-tech-m-a/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Barclays Names Co-Heads for Tech M.&amp;A.<date>June 6, 2011, 6:43 pm</date><text>Barclays Capital has promoted Greg Dalvito and Richard Hardegree to be the firm’s co-heads of technology mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Dalvito will be based in New York while Mr. Hardegree will be based in Menlo Park, Calif, according to an internal memo sent on Monday by Paul Parker, the firm’s global mergers and acquisitions chief. As the head of Barclays’ media team, Mr. Dalvito managed several billion-dollar transactions, including the $6 billion sale of Vivendi’s stake in NBC Universal. Mr. Hardegree, who has spent more than a decade with the technology team, has advised several blue-chip clients, like Cisco and AMD. Additionally, the company also announced on Monday, that it has promoted Barry Boniface, to be the head of its communications and media mergers and acquisitions group. The appointments come just one month after Barclays’ former head of technology mergers and acquisitions, Drago Rajkovic, left for a rival, JPMorgan Chase. In recent months, there have been several notable shuffles, as investment banks try to attract and retain the best talent. Last week, UBS hired Yusuf Nahmiyas as a managing director for its technology, media and telecommunications mergers team. He was most recently at Deutsche Bank. In April, Citigroup tapped Ethan Topper, the founder of the boutique investment bank Union Square Advisors and a former Credit Suisse banker, to be its global head of technology banking. The announcement was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. Here is the internal memo from Mr. Parker to his staff: As part of our further expansion of the Technology franchise, we are pleased to announce the appointment of Greg Dalvito and Richard Hardegree to Co-Heads of the M&amp;A Technology vertical. Both Greg and Richard bring extensive relevant experience to their new leadership roles. Greg and Richard will be based in New York and Menlo Park, respectively, and their coverage will span the various sub-sectors within the Technology vertical. Greg has headed our Media M&amp;A vertical for nearly five years. Greg’s recent and historical experience in media, telecom and technology has allowed him to advise on many franchise-defining transactions in those sectors. He has executed over $400bn in completed advisory assignments, including most recently advising Mediacom’s Special Committee in the $3.9bn take-private transaction, Vivendi in the sale of its $6bn stake in NBC Universal and Scripps in the $1.0bn acquisition of The Travel Channel. In addition to Greg’s new responsibilities, Greg will continue to work with and advise a number of our most important media clients. Richard has focused on technology M&amp;A in Menlo Park since 1999 and has spent the last 5 years as a senior member of our technology M&amp;A team. Over this time, he has established strong relationships in the electronics and communications technology sectors and has advised on over 50 technology transactions with clients, including Cisco, AMD, Nokia Siemens Networks, Avago and KLA Tencor. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that Barry Boniface has been appointed to Head of the Communications and Media M&amp;A vertical, supplementing his current leadership role in the Communications M&amp;A vertical. Barry has over 20 years of relevant industry experience and has been Chairman and Head of the Communications M&amp;A vertical for 4 years. He has advised clients on numerous high-profile transactions, including CenturyLink’s acquisition of Qwest, Sprint’s WiMAX JV with Clearwire, Verizon’s divestiture of its rural access lines to Frontier, AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Centennial as well as leading BellSouth’s $90bn merger with AT&amp;T and Cingular’s $46bn acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless.

But Mr. Scanlon, who helps oversee $7.5 billion for the John Hancock family of mutual funds in Boston and specializes in financial companies, is not about to give in and buy more shares. “It’s just not going to be a smooth ride,” he said. “You wake up every day and there’s a new headline and a new concern.” Bank stocks took another tumble late last week after Moody’s, the credit rating firm, warned it might downgrade the debt of giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo as the government eases back on support for the sector. Even as the market absorbed that news, reports that Goldman Sachs had been subpoenaed in an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney further unnerved investors, and sent that giant investment’s bank’s shares sinking. Pessimism about the sector was reinforced by weaker-than-expected economic data, including a bleak reading on unemployment on Friday. What’s more, well-known hedge fund investors like John A. Paulson and David Tepper have been quietly selling the big positions in the sector they had earlier amassed, a sign the smart money has already begun to bail. Mr. Tepper, in particular, had made huge profits by scooping up beaten-down bank stocks when they bottomed out in late 2008 and early 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis and riding their subsequent recovery. But in the first quarter of 2011, he sold off about a third of his positions in Citigroup and Bank of America. For Mr. Tepper, the timing was impeccable. Since the beginning of April, the KBW Bank Index has dropped 8 percent, compared with a much more modest 2 percent decline in the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. Last week, bank stocks sank to their lowest point since early December. For individual investors, who have long favored bank stocks as a source of dividends and at least the promise of stability, their recent performance has been a big disappointment. And few experts expect a turnaround anytime soon. “I haven’t seen investor sentiment this bad in a long time,” said Jason Goldberg, a longtime bank stock analyst at Barclays. “Not owning the group has been the right call, and people are skeptical about getting back in.” By many measures, the sector is pretty cheap. Diversified banks are trading at about 9.4 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 12.4 for the broader S.&amp; P. 500, according to FactSet Research. But then, they may deserve to be selling at a discount. Besides the worries about a possible debt downgrade and the investigations into the role they played in the financial crisis, major banks are facing headwinds on many fronts. For starters, federal regulations passed last year are set to cut deeply into revenue on everything from debit card transactions to trading on Wall Street. The restriction on debit card fees, known as the Durbin Amendment after the senator who proposed it, Dick Durbin of Illinois, could alone cost the top 25 banks roughly $8 billion in lost revenue, Mr. Goldberg said. The new regulations are set to go into effect on July 21, although Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, is pushing a proposal on Capitol Hill that could come up for a vote as early as next week that would delay their start by 15 months. Even if Mr. Tester wins a reprieve for the banks, other rules in the broader Dodd-Frank bill, which overhauled financial regulations, could cost the industry another $8 billion, according to Mr. Goldberg. In addition, new international rules now being developed to require major institutions to hold more capital as a buffer against future financial crises will also erode profitability. That is because money set aside as ballast is cash that will not be available to lend out or pay dividends or buy back stock. More than any of the changes hurtling toward them is a more fundamental problem that banks face — revenue is stuck in neutral. And a huge chunk of profits is not coming from the actual business of lending money, but instead represents gains from the release of reserves set aside in the past for possible loan losses. As these costs have eased, that money for a rainy day has fallen to the bottom line. In the first quarter of 2011, the top 20 banks earned $27.5 billion in pretax income. Nearly $11 billion, or 40 percent of that, came from the release of reserves, according to Mr. Goldberg. The proportion was even higher in the fourth quarter of 2010, when it hit 54 percent. While that money has helped camouflage anemic revenue and lackluster loan growth, it is hardly a long-term strategy for sustainable profit increases. 1 2 Next Page »Michael Scanlon is tempted by bank stocks, truly he is.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/non-ipad-tablets-fail-to-gain-customer-traction/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">IPad Rivals Fail to Gain Traction, a Report Says<date>June 2, 2011, 8:45 pm</date><text>JPMorgan Chase A report issed by JPMorgan Chase warned of an oversupply of tablet computers. Technology companies who hoped to outdo the Apple iPad by offering alternate slate-like products are not seeing the demand they hoped for from consumers, according to an analyst’s report issued by JPMorgan Chase. The report, which was issued on Wednesday, said companies building products to compete with the iPad have slowed production by as much as 10 percent since this time last March. At that time, the report said,  competing tablet companies created 81 million tablets; this year the number has fallen to 73 million. The report named the list of iPad rivals that have failed to gain traction, including Asustek’s Eee Pad Transformer, Motorola’s Xoom, Research In Motion’s PlayBook, and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab. Although the Eee Pad sold out in stores when it debuted, it is now easily available and in some cases overstocked. Apple said in March that since the original iPad was introduced in April 2010, the company has sold an estimated 20 million of the devices. That number does not include sales of the iPad 2, which was unveiled this year. The iPad 2 is in extremely high demand, with most Apple stores across the country still sold out on a regular basis. Analysts have noted that it won’t be easy for competitors to catch up to the iPad, especially because of the head start Apple has in its App Store, which has become a cornerstone of its success. The author of the report, Mark Moskowitz, has warned in the past of a possible tablet bubble burst, suggesting that a slew of iPad competitors could flood the market and sit there, not tempting customers and leaving a huge oversupply of products. “We still think a tablet bubble burst could occur later this year,” Mr. Moskowitz wrote in Wednesday’s report, but said the latest reduction of competing products “slightly temper our prior concerns.” “Non-Apple tablet hopefuls have adjusted to the weak showing so far,” he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/world/africa/27qaddafi.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Qaddafi Reportedly Stashes Billions in Western Institutions<date>Published: May 26, 2011</date><text>PARIS — Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi has stashed billions of dollars of Libyan oil revenues with financial institutions on Wall Street and in Europe, according to a document made public Thursday by an international advocacy group.Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC Holdings and Société Générale are among the major banks that have helped the strongman to invest some of the Libyan sovereign wealth fund’s $53 billion, according to the document, which was published on the Web by Global Witness. NATO warplanes have been carrying out air raids against Colonel Qaddafi’s forces since March in an effort to drive him from power, and the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor is seeking his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity. The document, independently verified as authentic by The New York Times, is a summary of the Libyan Investment Authority’s investments, created for the fund by the London office of the KPMG consulting firm and dated June 30, 2010. It shows Goldman Sachs holding $43 million in three accounts and HSBC holding $292.69 million across 10 accounts. The Libyan fund also invested $1 billion in structured financial products through Société Générale, and $171 million worth of such instruments through JPMorgan Chase. The market value of the fund’s investments fell 4.53 percent in the second quarter of 2010 from the first quarter, to $53.3 billion, the report showed. The sovereign wealth fund invested $19 billion in Libyan and Middle Eastern banks, including the Central Bank of Libya, the Arab Banking Corporation and the British Arab Commercial Bank, according to the report. The fund also invested billions of dollars in the stocks of well-known companies, including General Electric, Halliburton, BP and Nokia, and held a large portfolio of United States government bonds. The investments appear to have been legal at the time, although the United Nations, the European Union and the United States in February imposed targeted financial sanctions against the assets of Colonel Qaddafi and his family. The United States also froze the assets of Libyan government-owned and controlled entities. “The Qaddafi family has significant personal control over the state funds invested in the Libyan Investment Authority,” Global Witness said in a statement. “According to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, “Qaddafi makes no distinction between his personal assets and the resources of the country.” The organization called on banking regulators “to investigate whether these banks have done enough to ensure that state funds have not been diverted to the Gaddafi family’s personal benefit.” Global Witness said the report showed that banks and investment houses should be required to disclose state funds that they manage, as “This would cost nothing and would allow citizens to see that state revenue is not being stolen by corrupt leaders.” Fiona Laffan, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Jezz Farr, a spokesman for HSBC. JPMorgan Chase did not immediately return calls Laura Schalk, a spokeswoman for Société Générale, said the French bank “deals with many sovereign funds and complies with all applicable rules and regulations in that matter, but we can’t comment on specific clients or transactions.”PARIS — Col.

Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo already introduced the transfer service, called clearXchange, in Arizona, and it will roll out in more markets in coming months. It will be available nationwide within a year. The new service will improve upon banks’ existing person-to-person payment services, and it will compete directly with PayPal, which has shuttled money between consumers for years. But the banks claim that their new service will be more convenient because it cuts out the middle man: PayPal isn’t a bank, so you need to fund your account with money from a checking or other account. With the banks’ service, the money will be ferried directly from your checking account to the person you want to pay. And it doesn’t require you to dig around for a routing or other account number, as some services require. “The key thing here is that you don’t have to set up any additional accounts,” said Mike Kennedy, head of payments strategy at Wells Fargo and chairman of clearXchange. “People have a primary savings and checking account with their institution and that is what they want to transact out of.” The new service should save consumers time — though paper checks and cash still work just fine. But it’s unclear how much, if anything, it will cost. Pricing is up to each participating bank. If banks do charge for the service, you’ll have to figure out if the convenience factor makes it worthwhile. So how will it work? Let’s say you want to pay your friend back for dinner. If you both bank at any of the institutions in the network, you can reimburse your friend in a couple of ways. You can do it on the spot with your cellphone by accessing your bank’s mobile application or mobile banking site. Or, you can do it from your bank’s Web site on your computer. Either way, you would then enter their name, mobile phone number or e-mail address, and the amount you want to transfer. There’s also an optional “memo” field to note what the payment is for. After you hit send, the recipient will then get an e-mail or text message that alerts them of your payment with instructions on how to make sure it lands in the correct account. The first time they use the service, they will need to register their e-mail or phone number so it’s associated with their account. That raised several concerns in my mind: What happens if you mistype your buddy’s e-mail address or mobile phone number and the wrong person gets the message – will they be able to retrieve your money instead? Or what if someone hacks into your e-mail account and finds the note that someone wants to send you $200? In all of those scenarios, bank executives said the potential thief would need to have your online banking user name and password. If someone did manage to break into your online banking account, they could conceivably send your money to their own account. That’s not a new threat though. If a fraud were to occur, the banks said they would refund the person sending the money as soon as possible. Many banks already offer person-to-person payment services. At ING Direct, for instance, you can send money from your phone or your computer using the person’s name, e-mail address and the last four digits of their bank account number; you can save their information on a drop down menu for future payments. (ING customers with iPhones can also transfer money to one another by entering the amount in the bank’s mobile app and “bumping” their phones). But the banks that are part of the new exchange argue that their service makes the process even easier, for both senders and recipients. For instance, recipients in many existing services would need to enter their routing number on the bank site of the person sending them money. In the clearXchange system, they can retrieve their money using their own bank. The exchange hopes to lure more institutions to its service – it’s already discussing those possibilities with other big banks – which would increase the population of people who can transfer money this way. And eventually, the banks said they plan to offer the same service to customers who want to send money outside of the network. Would you use the new service? And would you pay for it?</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/the-best-at-takeover-defense/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">The Best at Takeover Defense<date>May 23, 2011, 8:07 am</date><text>JPMorgan Chase successfully defended clients against hostile takeover approaches 64.4 percent of the time — the best among the top advisory banks, according to an analysis by Financial News.

The bank said it would focus on commercial banking and wealth management, while selling or shutting some less-profitable retail banking operations. HSBC, one of the biggest European banks, said the steps were expected to help it improve returns despite slower economic growth and a stricter regulatory environment. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links HSBC investor presentation » “This is not about shrinking the business but about creating capacity to reinvest in growth markets and to provide a buffer against regulatory and inflationary headwinds,” said Stuart T. Gulliver, who took over as chief executive in January. He added that it was too early to say how many jobs would be cut. Banks are seeking to streamline their business as new financial regulations require them to maintain higher capital reserves, putting pressure on profitability. The Barclays chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., said in February that he would review businesses and close some that did not generate enough return. Less than a month after taking over as chief executive, Mr. Gulliver held a two-day meeting with his management team at HSBC’s Hong Kong offices to discuss necessary changes. They agreed that HSBC’s branches failed to focus enough on the special demands of local markets and clients. “We always tried to do everything, everywhere, always, and I’m not going to do that,” said Mr. Gulliver, who previously ran HSBC’s investment banking operation. Having already decided to withdraw from Russia’s retail banking market, HSBC said it would test all of its operations and businesses for profitability. The bank also set a target of 48 percent to 52 percent for its cost efficiency ratio. Costs as a proportion of income were 55 percent last year, which the bank said was “unacceptable.” Mr. Gulliver also said he planned to radically change HSBC’s business in the United States, which had been a drag on earnings ever since the subprime mortgage crisis dealt a blow to Household, the American lender HSBC acquired in 2003. HSBC is considering the sale of its American consumer bank card operation and plans to expand its private banking business to Latin America. It also hopes its commercial banking unit will benefit as America’s export industry rebuilds, Mr. Gulliver said. “We need to get to a situation where the U.S. doesn’t lose us a colossal amount of money,” Mr. Gulliver said. The business was a “significant financial cost to HSBC and a management distraction.” Despite large losses in the United States, HSBC weathered the financial crisis better than many of its rivals, mainly because it generated about half of its earnings from Asia and had strong deposit inflows on the commercial banking side. HSBC did not have to ask for financial help from the British government. But this year the bank’s share price started to lag those of Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Barclays as some investors expressed concerns about rising costs and the pace of growth. The strategy HSBC announced on Wednesday failed to create enthusiasm among some analysts. HSBC’s stock closed down more than 1 percent in London. “We would have loved to see a little bit more” change, said Pawel Uszko, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. “The main thing they said was cost-cutting, and that will take two to three years to get there.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/business/07bank.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan in Talks to Settle S.E.C. Inquiry Into Securities<date>Published: May 6, 2011</date><text>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company is in negotiations to resolve its role in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into how mortgage-linked securities were packaged and sold as the housing market came apart.JPMorgan’s securities unit has been cooperating with agency officials and is “in advanced discussions with the staff concerning a potential resolution of that investigation,” the bank said in a quarterly financial report filed with the S.E.C. on Friday. JPMorgan did not specify which collateralized debt obligations were the subject of the S.E.C. talks and said there was no assurance that the settlement would be completed. The C.D.O. investigation gathered momentum last year when the Goldman Sachs Group agreed to pay $550 million and admitted making a “mistake” in its disclosures about a subprime-linked C.D.O. Separately, JPMorgan, one of the lenders criticized over improper foreclosures on military families’ homes, won approval of a $56 million settlement of claims that it overcharged service members on their mortgages. Judge Margaret B. Seymour of United States District Court in Columbia, S.C., found that the accord, which provides $27 million in cash to military personnel overcharged on mortgages as well as other benefits, was a fair resolution of suits over the problem loans. Service members who suffered from the overcharges think the settlement “is phenomenal,” said Jonathon Rowles, a Marine fighter pilot who sued JPMorgan over the handling of his loan. “They recognized they made mistakes and they took the steps to fix them and compensate people for their damages,” Mr. Rowles said in an interview after the hearing. “I’m pleased with the way it turned out.” JPMorgan officials acknowledged earlier this year that one of the bank’s units made errors in handling mortgages covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. That law was enacted in 1942 to shield deployed military personnel from financial stress. Bank officials “regret the mistakes our firm made on mortgages for members of the military,” Frank J. Bisignano, a JPMorgan executive who leads the home lending unit, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. Under the terms of the settlement, Mr. Rowles and an estimated 6,000 other service personnel whose mortgage accounts were mishandled will split the $27 million, according to court filings. That will provide an average payout of $4,500 per soldier, but recoveries will vary based on the service member’s individual damage claims. The accord also calls for JPMorgan to cut interest rates on all mortgages held by deployed troops to 4 percent for one year, the filing shows. The lender has agreed to return houses that were improperly foreclosed upon and not yet sold, and to pay fair market value for those already auctioned off, according to the filing. It also will forgive any remaining mortgage debt of military borrowers who were protected by the law and mistakenly foreclosed upon.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company is in negotiations to resolve its role in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into how mortgage-linked securities were packaged and sold as the housing market came apart.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/chase-ends-test-of-5-a-t-m-fees/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Chase Ends Test of $5 A.T.M. Fees<date>May 4, 2011, 3:20 pm</date><text>Scott Olson/Getty Images JPMorgan Chase quietly ended a test in which it was charging a hefty $4 or $5 fee for non-Chase customers in two states for access to its A.T.M.’s. The change was noted this week by The Consumerist and others, although the pilot ended more than a month ago. The test began Feb. 8 and ended at the end of March, said Tom Kelly, a Chase spokesman. Non-Chase customers in Illinois were charged $5, and those in Texas were charged $4. The bank has gone back to the $3 fee it charged earlier. Mr. Kelly wouldn’t say why the pilot was halted or what the bank learned from it — or whether higher fees might be coming nationally. Other big banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citibank, also charge $3 to noncustomers for using their A.T.M.s. But smaller banks charge less and the average is less than $2.50, according to credit.com. Banks are looking for ways to increase fee income ahead of the federal limit on so-called swipe fees, which merchants pay banks to help process credit and debit card payments. Banks tend to see higher fees for noncustomers as one way to raise fee revenue while avoiding alienating their own customers. But there may be a limit on how much people will pay for convenience. I may grimace at a $2 or $3 fee to use another bank’s A.T.M., but I’ll pay it if I’m in a hurry — say, when I’m running to catch a flight — and another bank’s machine is handy. But I might try harder to find one of my own bank’s A.T.M.’s if the fee starts inching above $3. Or I might hunt for a new bank that has more A.T.M.s in my area — which is probably part of the plan when banks raise their fees. At what point would a fee make you walk a few extra blocks? Or switch banks?</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/european-regulators-investigating-banks-over-cds/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Europe Investigating Banks Over Derivatives<date>April 29, 2011, 8:28 am</date><text>11:05 a.m. | Updated European Union antitrust regulators announced on Friday two sweeping antitrust investigations into the world’s largest banks and their roles in a market for derivatives where a small number of companies control trillions of dollars of financial instruments. The European officials are looking at whether banks, including Barclays and Goldman Sachs, have harmed rival organizations that could compete in markets for providing information and clearing a form of transaction that had become critical to the smooth functioning of the entire economy. “Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive behavior and facilitate violations of competition rules,” the European Union antitrust commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said in a statement. “I hope our investigation will contribute to a better functioning of financial markets and, therefore, to more sustainable recovery.” The inquiry follows an examination of that market last year by The New York Times that highlighted efforts by banks like JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and others to control access to the derivatives market, even as global regulators try to bring transparency and safety to a murky corner of the financial world. Derivatives — instruments that shift risk from one party to another — added to the panic during the financial crisis, because banks and regulators did not know all the parties involved in trillions of dollars of interweaving contracts. The roughly $600 trillion market is controlled by a small number of players, concentration that has raised competition concerns in recent years. Those banks have recently taken many steps to try to hold on to their advantages in the market, even as regulators have tried to exert greater control over the market. The European Commission inquiry is focused on one type of derivative known as a credit default swap, which is essentially an insurance contract. They are widely used in stock investing and mortgage investing, when an investor wants to bet against a company’s bond or a mortgage bond. They are frequently used as a measure of the credit worthiness of companies and governments and have become a crucial component in gauging borrowing costs. The commission has previously estimated the value of all the positions on the market for credit default swaps to be $21.5 trillion, with about $3.27 trillion of that amount representing position on the market for credit default swaps in sovereign debt. The banks are involved in two crucial components of the market for credit default swaps. Sixteen of the banks are shareholders in Markit, a London-based organization that is the leading provider information on the market for credit default swaps. European Union officials suspect that the banks’ arrangements with Markit could effectively lock out other data providers. Nine of the banks involved also have a financial relationship with the IntercontinentalExchange, a public company that owns ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear U.S. That company is involved in a new business area known as clearing — which regulators are promoting as a way to bring more safety to the derivatives market. The banks had been creating their own effort to clear derivatives through a company they owned called the Clearing Corporation. In 2008, they sold that company to ICE, which was developing its own business. In exchange, ICE allowed the banks to influence the way the clearing business was set up and also granted them multiyear price breaks on clearing fees. Critics say the banks worked with ICE to create rules and practices that were anticompetitive, like membership rules that for a while blocked other brokers from signing up to do business there. Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for Mr. Almunia, said that officials began the investigation without receiving formal complaints from competitors but said wrongdoing would be “obviously harming other players in the market.” ThomsonReuters, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Bloomberg are among companies that could compete with Markit provide information on trading credit default swaps. Eurex and L.C.H. Clearnet are among the companies that also provide clearing services for credit default swaps. The derivatives market has exploded in size since the 1990s as more companies and investors looked for ways to take positions in commodities, corporate defaults, mortgages and other assets without having to purchase actual goods. Derivatives allow one party — usually a bank — to give customers exposure to price changes in goods through a written agreement to pay based on changing prices. The Justice Department has also been investigating this market and told The Times in December that its inquiry was focused on “the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries.” The Justice Department began its investigation of Markit in the summer of 2009, and by last fall it had expanded into looking at clearing practices between companies like ICE and the banks. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange also has a clearing house business and has partnered with the banks to develop it. The European Commission was in frequent contact with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission about the investigations announced on Friday, but it had received no indications that their United States counterparts were still actively pursuing similar investigations, said European Union officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly. The European Commission’s investigation may increase the pressure on the Department of Justice to take action. European regulators could fine the banks involved in the case up to 10 percent of their global annual sales for the kinds of antitrust and cartel violations that officials are investigating in Europe. Even so, the commission may find other ways to inject greater competition into the market. The commission has increasingly favored settling major investigations to win quicker results, and it could waive fines if the banks agreed to adjust their contracts with Markit and ICE Europe. The banks named in the investigation are JPMorgan, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Wells Fargo, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale. All of these banks declined to comment or did not return an inquiry. The IntercontinentalExchange did not reply to a request to comment. Markit issued a statement defending its actions. The company said it “has no exclusive arrangements with any data provider and makes its data and related products widely available to global market participants.” It said it was “unaware of any collusion by other market participants as described by the commission.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/opinion/23nocera.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Sewers, Swaps and Bachus<date>Published: April 22, 2011</date><text>Let me tell you a story about Jefferson County, Alabama, whose county seat is Birmingham, and whose congressman is Spencer Bachus, the Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee.Once upon a time — back when too many people viewed derivatives as glittering innovations with magical powers to hedge against risk — Jefferson County was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency to upgrade its sewer system. To finance the new sewers, it issued bonds totaling nearly $3.2 billion. After the sewer system was completed, the county moved all that debt from fixed rates to variable rates. It did so because some investment bankers at JPMorgan persuaded the county to purchase derivative contracts, in the form of interest rate swaps, that would supposedly allow it to avoid paying higher interest if rates went up. Magic indeed. At first, this arrangement worked well enough. Though the cost of the sewers was bloated beyond belief — they were originally supposed to cost $1 billion — the county made its bond payments. The bank reaped handsome fees from its swaps contracts. But the financial crisis caused those clever hedges to go blooey. Indeed, the swaps not only failed to protect the county from losses — they actually exacerbated the losses. In addition, two of its bond insurers had their credit rating lowered because they had also insured lots of toxic subprime derivatives. The downgrade triggered huge hikes in interest and principal for Jefferson County.* Today, the county is broke; according to The Birmingham News, it may run out of cash by July. It is toying with a bankruptcy filing — which, if it happened, would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in history. Though the county no longer has to pay fees to JPMorgan — the bank agreed to void the swaps as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission — its bond debt for the sewers now totals almost $4 billion. The Birmingham News described Jefferson County as a “poster child” for all that can go wrong when municipalities start playing with unregulated derivatives peddled by Wall Street sharpies. Has Spencer Bachus, as the local congressman, decried this debacle? Of course — what local congressman wouldn’t? In a letter last year to Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., he said that the county’s financing schemes “magnified the inherent risks of the municipal finance market.” (He also blamed, among other things, “serious corruption,” of which there was plenty, including secret payments by JPMorgan to people who could influence the county commissioners.) Bachus is not just your garden variety local congressman, though. As chairman of the Financial Services Committee, he is uniquely positioned to help make sure that similar disasters never happen again — not just in Jefferson County but anywhere. After all, the new Dodd-Frank financial reform law will, at long last, regulate derivatives. And the implementation of that law is being overseen by Bachus and his committee. Among its many provisions related to derivatives — all designed to lessen their systemic risk — is a series of rules that would make it close to impossible for the likes of JPMorgan to pawn risky derivatives off on municipalities. Dodd-Frank requires sellers of derivatives to take a near-fiduciary interest in the well-being of a municipality. You would think Bachus would want these regulations in place as quickly as possible, given the pain his constituents are suffering. Yet, last week, along with a handful of other House Republican bigwigs, he introduced legislation that would do just the opposite: It would delay derivative regulation until January 2013. It is hard not to see this move as an act of hostility toward any derivative regulation. After all, by 2013 a presidential election will have taken place, and if the Republicans take the White House and the Senate, one can expect that the next step would be to roll back derivative regulation entirely. Even if it is just about delay, rather than outright obstruction, that means the Republicans are asking for two more years during which the industry will add trillions of dollars worth of “financial weapons of mass destruction” (to use Warren Buffett’s famous description) to the $466.8 trillion of unregulated derivatives already in existence. How can this possibly be good? I tried to ask this question of Bachus, but I was told he was unavailable. I asked his staff if he believed, after the experience of Jefferson County, that derivatives should be regulated at all. I couldn’t get an answer. I’ll keep trying. It’s not just an answer his constituents deserve to hear. Given the risks derivatives still pose, it’s something the nation needs to know about Chairman Bachus. If he decides to tell me, I promise to pass it on. *Disclosure alert: Among the many lawsuits resulting from this fiasco is one brought by a bond insurer against Jefferson County.

Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme — as, indeed, he was — but took no action to protect investors or alert regulators.Those executives are John J. Hogan, the bank’s chief risk officer for investment banking; Matthew E. Zames, who oversees several important bank trading operations; and Carlos M. Hernandez, the head of global equities at the bank’s investment banking unit. The identity of those executives is the latest bit of news produced by the bitter courthouse fight between the global banking giant and Irving H. Picard, the bankruptcy trustee gathering assets for victims of Mr. Madoff’s fraud, which wiped out investor accounts valued at almost $65 billion when it collapsed in December 2008. Mr. Madoff operated his fraud primarily through an account he maintained at JPMorgan Chase. In addition, the bank created and sold its clients derivatives that were linked to various feeder funds that invested with Mr. Madoff, and it invested in those funds to hedge its risks on those derivatives. In December, Mr. Picard filed a lawsuit seeking $6.4 billion in damages, fees and profits from the bank, asserting that its high-level doubts about Mr. Madoff’s honesty and its failure to act on those doubts to protect investors made it complicit in Mr. Madoff’s fraud. That lawsuit did not disclose the identity of the bank executives who were involved in the bank’s assessment of Mr. Madoff, but a federal bankruptcy judge ruled earlier this week that the names had to be disclosed, and a new version of the case was filed on Thursday. In response to the new filing, Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, again denied the trustee’s assertions that the bank was complicit in Mr. Madoff’s fraud, calling such accusations “patently false.” The bank “complied fully with all applicable laws and regulations” in its dealings with Mr. Madoff and has “strong defenses to the claims brought by the Madoff trustee.” The bank had opposed releasing the names of the senior executives on the grounds that it would violate their personal privacy and embarrass them needlessly. The new filing by the trustee cleared up one of the mysteries in the redacted lawsuit: the executive who told a senior executive in June 2007 that Mr. Madoff’s returns “are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme” was Mr. Zames, a member of the bank’s executive committee who is often cited as a young star who could snag the bank’s top job someday. His warning was given over lunch to Mr. Hogan, who is also a member of the executive committee. The new filing also showed that Brian Sankey, Mr. Hogan’s deputy, was the executive who, after Mr. Madoff’s arrest, advised that it would be best if the agenda of the meeting at which Mr. Zames’s doubts were discussed “never sees the light of day again.” Mr. Hernandez was among the other bank executives who learned about Mr. Zames’s doubts that summer, according to the newly filed lawsuit. The new filing also identified the bank executive who refused to put his private banking clients’ money in Madoff-related funds. It was Michael Cembalest, a chief investment officer at the bank’s private banking unit. His team investigated Mr. Madoff and, “after seeing all of the red flags, chose not to invest” in any of the feeder funds, the lawsuit noted.A new federal bankruptcy court filing on Thursday showed that three current members of JPMorgan Chase’s executive committee had discussed, as early as June 2007, the possibility that Bernard L. Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme — as, indeed, he was — but took no action to protect investors or alert regulators.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/business/14views.html?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">Courting Disaster With Some E.T.F.’s - Reuters Breakingviews<date>Published: April 13, 2011</date><text>It didn’t take long for financial engineers to find a new playground.

But derivatives, special purpose vehicles and skewed incentives, hallmarks of the last boom and subsequent bust, have found their way into E.T.F.’s as well.The Financial Stability Board and the International Monetary Fund sounded the alarm this week, warning that E.T.F. innovations could pose a threat to financial stability. In an eerie echo of what many said about C.D.O.’s and other complex financial products a few years ago, the regulators noted that no one really knows how these E.T.F.’s will stand up when markets next freak out. E.T.F.’s that use derivatives to mimic the performance of an underlying index are worthy of particular scrutiny. The Financial Stability Board notes that, in these structures, incentives may be skewed. Because a synthetic E.T.F. involves both the bank’s asset management arm and its swaps desk, the bank can benefit twice. Additionally, synthetic E.T.F.’s can give banks a cheap source of funds for difficult-to-trade securities. But that could be a potential disaster if E.T.F. investors suddenly want their money back. Moreover, synthetic E.T.F.’s bring back the bogeyman of the 2008 financial crisis: counterparty risk. Synthetic E.T.F.’s, which make up nearly half of Europe’s $275 billion market, expose investors to the fortunes of the bank, not just the market’s ups and downs. Then there is securities lending. This is a profitable side business for some E.T.F. providers, who lend the collateral backing their investment vehicles to other investors for a fee. This is all well and good, until there’s a spike in redemptions and providers need their collateral back in a hurry. At $1.5 trillion and climbing, the global E.T.F. market is here to stay. Yet the onus should be on banks to prove their new toys aren’t simply hiding risk behind a complex web of arcane, yet fragile, financial innovations. If they can’t do that, it’s better to keep E.T.F.’s confined to their simplest form. Where’s the Reward? JPMorgan Chase came through the financial crisis with flying colors. And the bank’s $5.6 billion first-quarter profit reinforced its position as a market leader with strong risk management. But the tag has not done much for the bank’s valuation. At less than 10 times expected 2011 earnings, JPMorgan trades at a discount to its big bank brethren. In isolation, that price-to-earnings multiple doesn’t look too out of whack. It implies that shareholders don’t expect much growth in core earnings any time soon. And there’s already evidence of that, with revenue slipping 3 percent and pretax, preprovision profit dipping 8 percent from last year’s fourth quarter. Doubts remain about the impact on the financial sector of new regulations and capital rules that are still being fine-tuned. But that hits all banks. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, does have a track record of being more open and forthright about their impact than some others. Moreover, despite the revenue drop, JPMorgan is doing a better job with what it has, in part as it releases more loan-loss reserves. It posted a 13 percent annualized return on equity in the first quarter, up from a 10 percent return last year, which was better than Citigroup’s, while Bank of America posted another loss. In addition, the Federal Reserve has given the green light for JPMorgan to both quintuple its dividend and to buy back stock. Yet Citi, which has approval to increase its dividend by only a token amount, trades at 11 times this year’s earnings. Even Bank of America, which has had its capital plan rejected, trades at 10.6 times earnings. Granted, its advantages have helped JPMorgan’s stock performance beat its peers so far this year: its shares are up 10 percent, while most others are either barely up or have even fallen a percent or two. But it still leaves one of the strongest, best performing banks in the sector trading at a discount to its peers. That’s scant reward for success. AGNES T.

Bad mortgages and home equity loans cost the bank $1 billion in the first quarter, bringing total residential real estate losses since the financial crisis began to more than $20 billion. To make matters worse, bank officials said they expected these high loss levels to persist, and acknowledged that new mortgage lending had stalled. Mortgage originations fell 29 percent from the fourth quarter, as higher rates deflated the refinancing boom that propped up the business for much of 2010. Still, strong results from JPMorgan's investment bank as well as the release of $2 billion that had been set aside earlier to cover credit card losses offset the mortgage mess and contributed to a record $5.6 billion quarterly profit. As the first of the major banks to report their first quarter results, JPMorgan is closely watched as a bellwether for both Wall Street and the broader banking industry. Analysts suggested there was an increasing divergence in performance between Wall Street activities like trading and investment banking and more traditional retail lending. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other big financial institutions face a similar challenge as they report earnings this month. ''There just is not enough economic strength to fuel loan growth,'' David Trone, a banking analyst at JMP Securities, said. ''That traditional part of banking is just very stagnant.'' Revenue fell 8 percent to $25.8 billion, underscoring the challenge banks face as they try to expand their underlying businesses amid a still-sluggish economy and new government rules that restrict lucrative sources of income like overdraft fees. Then there is the cleanup bill for the foreclosure crisis. On Wednesday afternoon, JPMorgan's mortgage unit, Chase Home Lending, and 13 other servicers took a major step in putting their troubles behind them when they struck a deal with federal regulators to make sweeping changes to their loan servicing operations. Chase Home Lending plans to add 2,000 to 3,000 employees, create a separate unit to handle troubled mortgages and strengthen its internal controls. These moves forced the bank to take a one-time $1.1 billion charge in the first quarter to reflect the higher operating costs resulting from the new mortgage practices. The company also recently announced several prominent management changes at Chase Home Lending. ''We are adding a lot of intensive manpower and talent to fix the problems of the past,'' Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with reporters. The moves are aimed at addressing the problems flagged by regulators after a public uproar over foreclosure practices last fall. JPMorgan, Bank of America, GMAC, Wells Fargo and other big lenders were forced to review tens of thousands of mortgage files after revelations of paperwork mistakes and other errors. In some cases, those institutions were also forced to temporarily halt foreclosures across the country. The settlement with federal regulators still leaves open the possibility of fines and other legal actions. But it does not end separate settlement talks with state attorneys general, who have been pressing the banks to expand their mortgage modification programs and to pay at least $20 billion in penalties. Nor does Wednesday's agreement with federal regulators address a flurry of lawsuits from private investors seeking to recover losses on troubled loans and securities the bank sold. Although there has been little progress in the negotiations with either the attorneys general or investors, the bank has been setting aside money for any eventual deals. JPMorgan put aside an additional $650 million in the first quarter to cover these potential legal claims and other foreclosure-related costs, after increasing its litigation reserves by more than $6.7 billion in 2010. The bank also added $420 million to a separate reserve to cover expected losses stemming from the repurchase of faulty loans that it had sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing finance companies. Previously, it had set aside more than $5.6 billion for these claims. ''I think a good global settlement will be good for everybody,'' Mr. Dimon said. ''Keeping this mess going on is not good for anybody.'' The number of mortgage troubles overshadowed an otherwise solid quarter for most of the bank's other businesses. JPMorgan's quarterly profit of $5.6 billion, or $1.28 a share, exceeded analysts' estimates and was a sharp increase over the $3.3 billion, or 74 cents a share, that the company earned a year earlier. Indeed, JPMorgan's investment bank posted a $2.4 billion profit, down 4 percent from a year ago, when unusually strong trading results helped fuel a record profit. Investment banking fees were up 23 percent, as JPMorgan benefited from dozens of new deals, including AT&amp;T's $39 billion planned acquisition of T-Mobile USA. Fixed income trading revenue was up 33 percent from the prior year, while revenue from its equities group fell 8 percent on lower trading volumes. The corporate bank, which provides loans to mid-size companies, reported earnings of $546 million, up 3 percent from the period a year earlier. Bank officials pointed to a marked improvement in the number of mid-size businesses seeking credit. The credit card division reported a $1.3 billion profit, up 3 percent from the period a year earlier. But much of that gain was a result of the bank's decision to release about $2 billion it had previously set aside to cover losses.

At issue is a precrash investment vehicle, named Sigma, in which the bank had invested $500 million in assets from pension funds and other clients, nearly all of which the clients say was lost when the investment tanked in 2008. The clients were blindsided because they believed that Sigma was a safe way to invest. JPMorgan was not taken by surprise. As Louise Story reported in The Times on Monday, court documents show that warnings by top bank officials about Sigma and similar investments went all the way up to Mr. Dimon’s office. The gist of the warnings was not how to protect clients, but how the ailing Sigma presented the bank with what one e-mail described as “very big moneymaking opportunities as the market deteriorates.” When Sigma did indeed collapse, JPMorgan collected nearly $1.9 billion, according to the suit, a figure the bank disputes, without providing any alternative figure. It is possible that JPMorgan did nothing wrong legally — and that is precisely the problem. It clearly stinks to withhold information that may well have caused clients to change their minds — in effect, for the bank to treat clients’ money with less care than it treats its own. As long as banks operate that way, there is no restoring trust in the financial system, or, by extension, in the political system that props it up. But is it illegal? JPMorgan has said that the unit of the bank that handled the clients’ investments in Sigma was not, by law, allowed to confer with the unit of the bank that benefited from Sigma’s demise. That may be true, but as Ms. Story pointed out, in this case, the information rose to executives who oversee the entire company and were in a position to intervene. That they did not is a failure to do the right thing, even if the court decides that the bank did not break the law. In the meantime, efforts to write new rules to try to curb such conflicts is hamstrung by a Republican backlash against the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that was passed last year. There is proposed legislation to repeal provisions of the law, and the agencies that have to implement the law are in danger of not getting enough money to do the job. As the pension funds in the class-action suit against JPMorgan can certainly attest, only the banks will benefit from business as usual.So what did Jamie Dimon know and when did he know it?</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/jpmorgan-accused-of-breaking-its-duty-to-clients/?ref=morganjpchaseandcompany">JPMorgan Accused of Failing in Duty to Its Clients<date>April 11, 2011, 2:11 am</date><text>A lawsuit sheds new light on one of Wall Street’s oldest problems — whether banks treat their clients’ money with the same care that they treat their own, The New York Times writes.
